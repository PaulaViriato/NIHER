                "body": "Apesar de se chamarem \"nova MPB\", as influencias de rock'n'roll s\u00e3o claras no Lampir\u00f4nicos. O Grupo baiano foi formado no in\u00edcio dos anos 2000, mesclando influencias regionais tradicionais e reflex\u00f5es contempor\u00e2neas de \"Lampi\u00f5es eletr\u00f4nicos\". Era uma verdadeira lanterna de uma musicalidade independente.\n\nA banda lan\u00e7ou 3 albums entre 2001 e 2008, terminando de forma prematura pouco depois do lan\u00e7amento do mesmo album. Depois do fim, o guitarrista Robertinho Barreto resolveu se juntar a um barbudo desafinado para criar um grupo novo, levando as experimenta\u00e7\u00f5es musicais ainda mais distantes. O grupo novo? BaianaSystem.\n\nApesar de todas as diferen\u00e7as, eu considero a BS como a sucessora espiritual da Lampir\u00f4nicos. Isso fica mais forte no primeiro cd (BaianaSystem, 2010), com v\u00e1rios pontos em comum com \"Caia na Madrugada\" (Lampir\u00f4nicos, 2008). O ponto alto \u00e9 a m\u00fasica [Amerika Expressa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAAYFbDYrbw) (Baiana System), praticamente um remix de Americal\u00ed (Lampir\u00f4nicos)."
