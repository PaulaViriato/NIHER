I tell them the truth.

It's a very large and diverse city.\n\nIt kind of confirms what I have experienced as a Londoner, for instance the Hindu and Sikh makeup in west London and the Jewish population in north London.\n\nIt would be interesting to see a map of which cultures make these populations, I think the south-east and north-east will be made up of white British Christians, for example.\n\nIt's also interesting because this sort of map doesn't capture the diversity in London, I have Jewish and Christian heritage, but if I had to choose one, I would choose Christian because I have stronger family ties to this side and I have been exposed to it more.\n\nAlso, there is no way that 41% of London is in Church on a Sunday! I think people tick the box thinking that a Christian-style upbringing is the same as being Christian, which is open to interpretation.  I'm sure that's the same for other religions and people.",

                "Bengali here! A lot of my family live in London near Waterloo Station. I think I can clear up some questions:\n\nThe reason why specific places are so densely populated with Muslims is because culturally (For South Asians at least) we tend to live with our families for longer, if not, indefinitely. All of my uncles, aunts, cousins etc all live together or nearby and often visit each other and share parenting responsibilities. If my aunty is sick, my cousins will just go next-door to their aunty and play with their cousins. \n\nMultigenerational housing is extremely common for South Asian families as old-people's homes are generally (Not always) frowned upon. So our parents often live with us and we care for them and stay close together to share caring responsibilities. \n\nWe also manage finances differently! Which is a big part of why Muslims/South Asians band together. British people tend to have their own independent incomes from their family, they fund their own lives and only their own lives, they get a job and pay for their own university, weddings etc. Within my family's culture, it's more holistic. We all contribute to a very large pot and share the money to make sure everyone is fed, clothed, has a roof over their head, education etc. None of my cousins are without, and if my uncle loses his job (NHS budget cuts) my other uncles will help him and provide for his children until he finds another job. Family stick together and Muslims generally see each other as family regardless of blood. \n\nAll of my cousins, both male and female have all gone to university (Barring those still in school) without debt and they all have pretty good careers. This might not be the case for every family, my family is extremely privileged and wealthy... But I think British people are just culturally different and that's why people get confused when they see close-knit Muslim families/friendships. \n\nMost of my British friends have been forced to get a job and pay rent by their parents, or forced to pay for their own university fees, healthcare, transport etc. It's very surreal to me because my family, while they're firm believers in hard work and avoiding laziness, would NEVER let me go hungry or expect me to pay rent. They would just expect me to do chores and contribute however I can and support me in getting a job... But they'd never kick me out if you get what I mean.\n\nWhy do British families kick their children out so young? A lot of my friends are struggling with juggling rent and university, but they say they can't go back home because their parents won't let them/expect them to cover rent/food bills anyways. It just seems counterproductive and unloving, so I would like some insight because I'm sure there is love involved, it's just different. Thank you!",
                "I wonder how many people that claim a religion actually follow it. Most of my family thinks they are catholic, but in the sense that they celebrate Christmas and Easter. No church, no prayers, just buying gifts and singing about rabbits hopping down a trail.",

Immediate guess is higher levels of tolerance (and/or perhaps lower levels of devotion) amongst Christians than other religious groups leading not only to better relations with the non-religious overall, but higher numbers of Christians turning apostate. The data scientist in me wants to say that we could also reverse the causation and see higher levels of non-religious conversion to Christianity, or coincidental fulfilling of certain of each group's communal preferences bringing them into the same locations, but I doubt these would hold up in the study of religious relations.",

I don't mind talking about religion, but it's always their religion and completely unprompted and unwanted. \n\nI work in a nursing home and every Sunday about 20 or so residents out of 70/80 go to the common room and have a church service. Others may be Christian and just not come down but by all means, the whole facility isn't Christian and it's not one of those \"Christian values\" companies. Really, religion plays no major part in my job. I've been there 8 months, and the only times I've run into religion was when I had 1 willing conversation about it because it was mutual and I was asked if it was cool to talk about before it happened, and then like the 3 other times someone has cornered me to tell me about the word of God or something. \n\nBut my coworkers just love coming up to me and talking to me about their religion. Never ask what I follow, people I don't even know are talking to me about a gospel fest and saying I should join and blah blah. I literally sit outside on my breaks and not in the break room so I can be alone and play on my phone. \n\nI don't wanna have to have an HR meeting by telling anyone I don't wanna hear it and to leave me TF alone, or burn any bridges, or start a rumor that the new person is a dick and worships satan.

I have discovered that who I find attractive is really just one small part about me. Being my kind, encouraging self is who I am. It's been pretty epic. I'm still working through parts of it. The personal growth has been amazing! \n\nI have found myself looking back through my life and the values I held from a child to now. I've been exploring who I am without religion and also who I am besides being gay. I don't mean to harp on that,  it's just where I currently find myself. In all of that,  I've discoverered that I've wanted to do the \"right thing\" even ever since I was a kid. I see I wanted to live a life of honor way before I accepted Christ. Knights, honor, character, integrity, looking out for people, those things resonate(d) huge within me. \n\nAs a teenager, not growing up in church, when I got saved, I thought it was every Christian's duty to take Jesus words seriously and put them to work our lives. Loving others, serving, ect. I was taught that \"for God to trust you with bigger things,  you have to be faithful in the little things.\" Which meant spending time in His Word and living that out.\n\nHere is where I am at currently: so if Jesus/God all isn't really real,  then where do I find my direction? My moral compass?\n\nI've been writing down my own personal values of how I want to live by pulling values from my life now,  the person I want to be, from the military, from Marcus Aurelius book \"Meditations\" and other books, podcasts,  ect. Maybe that's how it's done.\n\nIf I may, I have a few questions. \n\nHow have you constructed your personal honor codes?\n\nFor those who once believed, how did you get over that fear of something bad happening to you for not believing?Did anything bad happen when you stopped tithing? Did you have a feeling like you were big disloyal or anything?\n\nI keep hearing the \"you are being decieved\",  \"the enemy is a roaring lion, the father of all lies.\" How did you combat that in your life? \n\nHow do you remain spiritual without religion?\n\nWhat are some religious mindsets that you were able to free yourself from? What where the hardest \"to break\" and how did you do it?\n\nI'm stoked about this journey. I've had so many epiphanies and eye openers. It's like \"Whoa!\" I feel so free already. I'm excited about what my future holds.  I'm excited to date women and find my queen without fear of doom or feel that I'm evil,  or grose. I'm excited about being who I am in this world and bringing to it all that I have to offer.  I feel like I get to finally truly live! I'm excited about making friends outside of religion with the goal of just enjoying each other because we have the same goals/interests/ likes. It's gonna be so epic. \n\nI'm looking forward to the conversations with you all!\n\nEdit #1 - Wow! You all rock! I see all the responses coming in.  I can't wait to read them all and get back to you all. Thanks for all your responses! Stay rad!\n\nEdit #2 - Ladies and gents, you all rock! Thanks to each and every one of you for taking time to stop in and comment. It's brought forth great conversations and insights. It has been a delight to hear about your personal value systems. There are still more comments to get to.  Thanks again to all who have shared.",

But if they say Indian, say something about how you're not quite sure what you'll wear, but you're going to try hard to get it right.  Then something magical happens: you will get a call about 5 minutes later from a woman who calls herself \"Auntie\" but is almost certainly not the aunt of either the groom or bride.

Neither of them are Hindi or Indian (as far as I\u2019m aware, though I don\u2019t know them hugely well), they just found Indian wedding traditions beautiful and deeply meaningful and wanted to incorporate them into their wedding ceremony. Following details might be fuzzy because I was a kid at the time:\n- Pretty sure this was before gay marriage was legalized in the state where this took place, so I think they got married in another state and had the ceremony back home so their family and friends could come.\n- They sent us a guide on what to wear (they encouraged us to wear traditional Indian clothing, but Western dress was also acceptable). I wore a sari and a maang tikka and they had a guide on how to appropriately wear them.\n- Probably most importantly: there *were* Indian people at the wedding. OOP doesn\u2019t know because they weren\u2019t there. The local Indian community was heavily involved in the wedding (couple did a ton of community work in the city and pretty much knew everyone). An Indian religious leader led the ceremonies the same way they\u2019d be held in India, several Indian people were involved in the planning of the wedding to ensure it\u2019d be authentic, and the reception had tons of authentic food from local Indian chefs.

She said it was body paint, and me being taught that more time outside = darker skin, I didn't know about other races till I was 12/13 when I went up to a black kid asking why they were so sunburnt; I got punched and sent to the school office where they learned I knew nothing of racism, and had to explain that to my class.\n\nIt will mark me having learned that information for only half my life in just under a year, and to date I have the exact same way of thinking as the bottom guy, I had to learn that all on my own with no help from 1 saying my mom burned into my head from a young age, \"Treat others how you want to be treated\".

This is why swearing on the Bible in court or public office is purely symbolic and you can swear on any book\u2014the dictionary, if you want. It\u2019s the law that holds people accountable, not a supernatural force.\n\nSo, as others have said, you don\u2019t need to swear. HOWEVER\n\nThe human need for ritual and rites of passage is a real and valid one, as evidenced by its persistence throughout human evolution. It is very clear that, for some people more than others, their emotional well being is tied to ritual, routine, community, etc. Religion normally fulfills this purpose, but we can have these things without appealing to the supernatural. In the same way a birthday party doesn\u2019t feel complete without blowing out candles, you may not feel like your transition out of religious life is complete until you perform some kind of ritual to acknowledge it, or make a promise to yourself. So, if that is the case, just invent one. This is a chance to be creative. Maybe you sing a song. Maybe you take your childhood Bible and make art out of it. Maybe you write a letter to your future self and put it in a time capsule. It can be anything you want. \n\nBut understand that it is also possible that it may take some time for you to grow into your new worldview. Like breaking in a new pair of shoes. You may perhaps get curious about other religions and want to explore them; there is nothing wrong with that. Religion studies will help you better understand humanity, and yourself.

What myths are really being expressed here\n\nOrthodox versions of religion are far worse in that there are *giant* gaps between these two.\n\nAtheism is much more about being rational, and frankly, it doesn't do you a service to reflexively reject anything because that puts you in the same position as an orthodox Christian, thinking in exclusive ways.\n\nToo often, atheists make the same kinds of thinking errors that stupid religious people do, and I'm suggesting you don't head in the direction of scientism.\n\nThe way most people who are atheists speak about religion, especially after escaping Christian cults, act like \"all religion\" is identical when it isn't. Or make \"religion\" into a monolith.\n\nThat's just not rational or scientific, and there is a tendency in your position to react emotionally while rationalizing a leap into another thinking error.\n\nFurther, being trapped in the endless reductive cycle of \"beliefs\" that cults will make you susceptible to means you will look to other ideas you can \"believe in\" when the problem is \"believing in\" in the first place.\n\nEveryone expresses Atheism differently, but I am sad to see when people jump out of the fire into a frying pan version of atheism, especially when they express an affinity for science.\n\nPoorly expressed versions of atheism and scientism end up in the same place as fundamentalism, so be careful.\n\nThere are congruent ways to have a religious viewpoint and think scientifically also, as indeed, science would only exist with its primary advocates throughout history- religious people.\n\nSo, in your case, it might be useful to grasp the underlying logical fallacies of fundamentalist thinking and work against those things first.\n\nOf course, you will have an emotional 'rejection' period, but you will later need something with more depth than reactionary naturalist/materialist atheism will have for you.\n\nI ended up in a place where I no longer demonized these people but also saw there were two main camps:\n\n1.

High And Mightier Than Thou\n\nNeither of which fit me, but neither of these was particularly related to actual doctrine and seemed to supersede Our Main Teacher's lessons, creating a kind of \"religion means whatever I say it means,\" and I could not accept that narcissistic version of religion.\n\nNeither did I want a narcissistic version that was \"against\" religion in such a limited fashion.\n\nSo know that no matter what, you have agency and are around people in the atheist community who can understand the damage you've experienced from ego and ignorant projections of some passive-aggressive combination of fanatics.\n\nMy advice: Welcome and try hard not to become one yourself, in a reactive manner.",

I went through it, and the best way  I can describe it is as a veil lifted, or a weight lifted. You will likely feel more free, even though it is purely for yourself , and more of an act of symbolism in itself. There is power in that act; don't be afraid to use it.   \nWith that being said, also take note that you will be effectively excommunicated, which means you will not be able to receive sacraments from your church, participate or act as a witness in such sacraments (including wedding or holding the position of godfather) , although in this case it seems very much like the desired result. \n\n  \nThere is an act you can send to your archbishop, the act of apostasy. To be specific, you need to send it to the Chancery office of your Archdiocese (the one you were baptized in, not the one where you currently live in)  \n\n\nBecause it is rather informal and a case of exception, there are rarely any model of it, but I was lucky to find one in my mother tongue (French) so I just ... copied most of that, really.   \n\n\nWhile there is no right or wrong way to write an act of apostasy, here is what I recommend yours contain :   \n\n\n* The title : ACT OF APOSTASY + the date you are sending the letter\n* Your \\[complete, at birth\\] name, the name of your father and the name of your mother\n* Your date and town of birth\n* The date and church at which you were baptized  \n* Your contact information in case they need to verify that info and/or send you a confirmation\n* A short paragraph explaining your intent to leave the church \\[no need to tell why\\]\n* Explain that this decision is of your own free will, and that in contrast, your baptism was done shortly after your birth, in such a way that you could not be fully aware of the consequences of this choice\n* Explain that you are aware that this means you will no longer be able to attend church or receive Christian sacraments and that it is the desired outcome\n* Kindly ask that your name be struct off the records and registries of baptism and that any and all information regarding the sacraments you have received be adequately disposed of and/or destroyed \n* Ask for a confirmation of the deed, writing again the different ways in which best to contact you \n* Most importantly, this can have **legal value** so you **NEED** to sign this **of your OWN HAND**\n* (optional) You could add a small paragraph asking , if the deed cannot be completed, to know the reasons why as well as how best to proceed to carry on your will in the most effective way, and a list of resources/persons you can contact to do this. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wish you the best of luck with this ordeal. Of course, because I was not in the same religion branch as you , the process might be a little different, but the general format should stay the same and would this not apply to your particular case, I hope that it can at least set you off and get it started. Keep us posted ! :-)",

                "I felt the same. I felt like \"not going to church\" was not enough to get un-baptized, you know?\n\nI kinda wanted an \"official\" way to do it.\n\nI personally became a member of The Satanic Temple. In case you don't know them, they don't actually believe in biblical Satan. They believe in science, facts, logic, and the separation of state and church. But joining it felt like I officially signed a \"I revoke and renounce all religions\" contract.\n\nMaybe it's silly, but it made me feel good, so to me that's a positive. Plus it supports them a bit to fight the religion's advance into government, amongst other things.",
                "If you're still praying, going to church, wearing cross pendants, etc., then stop.\n\nIf you're still ascribing events and phenomena to god, then stop.\n\nIf you fear the idea of going to hell, then stop.\n\nHowever, you can still say \"Oh my god\", appreciate religious art and architecture, and celebrate Christmas if you want. I'm a lifelong atheist and I love the architecture of old churches. I also love Christmas; I just ignore the Jesusy parts of it.",

                "I mean it's not like there's an official ceremony or anything for leaving, you just stop self identifying as Christian and don't go to Chrurch. Up to you if you want to tell your parents or make an announcement to your friends.",
                "Ceremony and pomp and circumstance is more of a religious thing.  As black panther once said, \"we don't do that here\".  In order for there to be a \"renunciation\" ceremony, the religion in question would need to come up with something....and they have a vested interest in not giving followers a way out.  \n\n\nWear clothes with mismatching fabrics, eat shellfish, and break any of those weird old testament laws that doens't hurt anybody.

That said:  \nThe Satanic Temple has a ritual for specifically helping people move past this specific stumbling block. You could consider performing an Unbaptism if you think it would help you more fully disavow any supernatural connection to Christianity.",

Believing god never did anything for me and now I\u2019m coming to terms that religion helped ruin my life and there\u2019s nothing I can do and nobody to be mad at but me.

This is a comment I left on another forum where a religious zealot wouldn't attend his sister's same-sex wedding:\n\nBut you do want to hurt your sibling, and did so. You hurt them for transgressing against your belief system.   \nThe older I get, the more I see that most fundamentalist religious beliefs are smokescreens for sadism, and give the religious adherent a pretext to condemn others, which they relish. Kind of like the way you relish condemning your sister for her transgressions.  \nCombine this with the fact that most of the worst people I've ever met are religious fundamentalists (especially Evangelical Christians and Conservative Catholics), I've come to the realization that most fundamentalists conflate sanctimony with goodness. Religious people are not necessarily good people because they are religious. They just believe they are. Like you. You believe because you are following the tenets of your religion that you're a good person, but you're really just a bigoted asshole who has now alienated your sister, possibly for good. It's also ironic to me that most religious fundamentalists ignore the prevalence of violence in our society, but have no tolerance for variations in sexual or gender orientation. The religious rarely draw such a hard line in the sand over violent actions. Hell, most churches are covering up child sexual abuse and other atrocities.  \nBelieve what you want and stay true to your belief system, but it hasn't made you a good person and no one outside of your belief system sees you as such. I certainly don't see you as a good person for standing by your beliefs in this case, nor do I respect you for doing so.  \nI didn't always believe it, but I now believe that Christanity is a scourge on this world. Look at how the evangelicals have gone all-in on the cult of Trump and QANON, two of the most malignant influences on American culture that are highly responsible for the splintering of our society.  \nBeing obedient to your religious fundamentalism does not make you a good person. If the temptation of condemnation of others is more important than a filial bond, as is shown in your post, you have just proven my point.  \nYTA",

They also conveniently forget all the wars that have been waged because \"our religion is better than their religion\". \n\nEven worse, they are admitting that the only reason they don't run around murdering and raping is because they are worried about the consequences. Anyone who doesn't perform evil acts simply because they are afraid of the consequences is NOT a good person. If there was a hell then that's where those people would belong.",

                "Bring it the f on",
                "The theme with theists is that anything in existence, including morals had to be given by a higher power and 'magicked' into existence because they cannot grasp evolution over great time scales or understand that in the deep past things were very different. Average lifespan was very short due to the environment, predators and illness, which meant the productive period of a breeding female was very short too. For a man 30 years old was very old even up to 2000 years ago. Surviving to 50, 60 or 70 years old was very rare.\n\nConsider:\n\nPrior to the advent of agriculture humans and their immediate predecessors went around in small extended family groups just like modern apes do now where each was dependent on the other to be gatherers, groomers, support in times of need, hunters and look-outs for predators. Anyone killing other members of the group has lessened the overall survival likelihood of the group. If empathy and cooperative behaviour was 'god given' why do we see it in many animals? It suggests that it was a positive survival mechanism long before there were any humans and we all got it from a common ancestor.\n\nAnyone committing violence against another group member risks burdening that group with infirm group members.\n\nIf you steal what another has worked for you reduce their chances of survival, you reduce the likelihood of cooperative behaviour, this will likely lead to violence, which further reduces group survival ability. Certain squirrels will steal from other squirrels, but they know to do it when the other isn't looking and they know to run away fast if they are caught stealing because it will lead to violence.\n\nSexual morality is a little more complex, but not by much. Human babies require 9 months gestation and several years of support for infants, and let's not forget that for millennia childbirth was the leading cause of death for human females with death rates due to pregnancy and childbirth at 40 - 50%, with similar numbers of live birth off-spring dying before the age of 5 years. Up to Roman times death rates were so high among children that they weren't considered to have rights before the age of 5 years. If you killed a child under 5 years it wasn't considered murder, it was considered depriving the parent of property.\n\nIf the individual is running around impregnating all the females who is going to support those women and children that survive? How many will die from childbirth? Humans are evolutionary designed to form emotional bonds, taking the female of another leads to violence and so we are back to the reduced survival of a group due to violence. Human parents care for their children, if you take the daughter of a parent and she ends up dying because of your actions, or lack of care, you have reduced the groups survival by depriving it of a valuable resource, a breeding age female.\n\nThe Greeks and Romans adopted monogamy long before the Jews did, prior to Roman occupation Jews could have as many wives and concubines as they could afford to support.\n\nDiseases affected humans as they do now, if you pass on a sexuality transmitted disease to females you reduce the reproductive capacity of the group - that means the group survival is affected. There are less children coming along to support the older members of the group who hold cultural and practical knowledge gained from older members of the group before them and from experiential learning. The more promiscuous you are the more likely you are to contract a disease and pass it on to other members of the group.\n\nEvery 'moral' has an evolutionary imperative that gave rise to it, even primitive humanoids could work that out. There was no need for humans to be given morals, they knew what increased their survival chances and what didn't, even before humans evolved. Modern humans will kill and rape if they can be convinced - those you're doing it to are not part of our group and you're unlikely to get caught. Even, or especially, the religious ones.\n\nDo as you would be done by is the most successful evolutionary survival strategy for a group, it's no more complex than that, hence we evolved to have empathy. Those who lack empathy and are not cooperative are a threat to group survival, any group with significant proportions of those type of individuals would be more likely to die out and not pass on their genes to future generations.",

The first time that I encountered profound loss, I didn't know what I was doing or feeling -- it was terrible, I didn't know how to cope, and I didn't have a tradition built from millions of people stretching back 30 generations to fall back on.

I try to minimize / avoid uncomfortable or painful events if possible but if I have no option, I accept and embrace that the experience is not going to be pleasant. I don't deny myself the experience of pain, I don't try to stoically pretend that it doesn't affect me, I just accept and embrace that painful / uncomfortable / unpleasant situations and emotions are part of the human experience.

It's also what Solzhenitsyn was talking about when responding at a speech, \"Man has forgotten God, that is why this has happened.\"\n\nHumans are so constituted that faith is mandatory. It's systemic. You cannot function without it. You don't need \"faith\" to know the temperature that water boils at, that's absolute knowledge. Zero faith required. You cannot know everything, probably even most things and for things you don't know or know well, a level of faith is required - belief in that which you don't have absolute knowledge of.\n\nOP cannot believe that in the current year, with computers, the Internet and critical thinking available to humans that people *still* believe in religion. How can we be in the year 2023 and people worship sky daddy who lives in the clouds? How is that remotely possible? How can people be so  dumb or so easy to trick?\n\nOf course, OP is projecting. He's likely far more reliant on faith and religion that he even remotely understands. The most telling remark is his comment about \"critical thinking\", defined as: \"Critical thinking is the ability to analyze arguments objectively, question assumptions, interpret and evaluate evidence, and consider issues from multiple perspectives.\" but perhaps the defining feature of this period of time in America is also referred to as \"critical thinking\" in the Marxian sense of a \"ruthless criticism of all that exists\". In essence, to criticize things from as many perspectives as possible, up to and including knowing and unknowing lies and fabrications in an effort to tear down the current thing to make room for the (supposedly) new and better thing. OP would likely conflate the two versions of \"critical thinking\", claiming that the second is the first. OP's inability to *not* be *critical* towards religion has created a funhouse horror mirror version of what it is. He likely understands religion less than an eleven year old understands how a car engine works. In essence: his inability to interact fairly to religion on any level makes it a complete and total blind spot.\n\nPeople's faith changed from being in religion and God and instead found it's place in science. Science is good for some things, it can explain many things and it's good at providing absolute knowledge of a thing (given enough time, theories, testing against reality, etc.). \"Follow the science.\" While in religions, the clergy are the 'experts' in faith (that which you lack absolute knowledge of), in science, the scientists are the 'experts'. While a religious allegory can demonstrate and make clear a fundamental human truth which lent it authority, science can demonstrate absolute knowledge in it's own magisteria, which lends it authority.\n\nBelow is a quote from Mattias Desmet:\n\n>All of this translated into a problem of replicability of scientific findings. To put it simply, this means that the results of scientific experiments were not stable. When several researchers performed the same experiment, they came to different findings. For example, in economics research, replication failed about 50 percent of the time, in cancer research about 60 percent of the time, and in biomedical research no less than 85 percent of the time. The quality of research was so atrocious that the world-renowned statistician John Ioannidis published an article bluntly entitled \u201cWhy Most Published Research Findings Are False.\u201d\n\nAnd this is only recently. Science has \"told us\" that cigarettes were healthy, cocaine was a perfect guardian of one's health, and most people are aware of the numerous hundred million and billion dollar lawsuits for the various pharma related fields. There are corrupt people, liars, sophists, genuine well-meaning mistakes. High-ranking 'experts' in a field frequently dismiss new work that challenges their preconceived notions to maintain their positions - confidently. Yet these are the 'experts' many people put their faith in - unknowingly. They conflate their own faith for absolute knowledge. Much like Christianity has had huge periods where people lost faith in the Church, where there were highly immoral clergy, where liars and sophists twist meaning, and I'm sure atheists have tons of other complaints.\n\nBoth are essentially belief systems. People put their faith in them for a variety of differing reasons. Religion is more honest however in that it's a belief system while what science has become pretends to be the arbiter of all truth and denying even the smallest possibility that there might be anything faith-related to it.  Nietzsche and Solzhenitsyn were both correct.",

Human beings hit a developmental milestone when they are roughly 6, where they are able to understand what death is and that they will die, that their death is inevitable and permanent. This results in a phenomenon called death terror. This kind of existential terror is completely novel and horrifying to the child, and this is where religion comes in.\n\nReligion provides relief from the death terror. That is its primary function. it insulates the mind from the horror of mortality. It gives the child a reason to believe that they are actually immortal, and that true death does not apply to them.\n\nThis is why there are so many religions, but that all have an afterlife, some reason to believe death isn't real. Even Buddhism, without a god, isn't immune to this (reincarnation).\n\nIt's a human thing. Humans fear death as fearing death is selected for by evolution. The more that humans fear death, the less likely they are to die and pass on their genes. This isn't hard to understand.",

Some Blackpink fans (Blinks) who are famously known for consistently driving hate trains towards BTS, along with other haters, saw it and decided that they would like to make an issue out of it.\n3. The line, \"Allah akbar\" is apparently not allowed in music because islam forbids it. Obv, nonmuslims aren't aware of this fact and I believe Frank has since done his live performances without the mention of that line.\n4. BTS haters' favorite target is RM. It was pretty obvious he shared it due to the song having themes of yearning and that one line is literally hardly noticeable for everyone else.\n5. Now he's getting posted, making it seem like he's responsible for the creation of that song in many (controversial and problematic) news outlets.\n6. BTS fans on the other hand are trying to handle this as a sensitive situation as to not discredit Muslim people who might not have liked that that one line is on the song.\n7. Honestly, making it out to be islamophobic is so stupid and literally crucifying a singular celebrity for posting it when literal hundreds of other celebs have posted it and praised it is so fcking dumb.

                "I'll be honest, I came here from a Twitter link myself, and I felt like I had to clarify some things since we end up getting blamed for stuff we didn't do. Most BTS fans don't have a problem with the song. We're very aware that it's not islamophobic (I say this as a muslim) and it's using religion as a metaphor to talk about unrequited love through a makeshift therapy session in the back of a cab. BTS have very metaphorical and introspective lyrics themselves, so we're quite perceptive towards lyrics and tend to disect them and understand them to a deeper level and tey to understand what the artist wants to convey.\nThe person is the screenshot, which is probably a solo stan (people who tend to just like one member of the group and spread hate towards the other members . It's a long explanation, honestly, but that's the gist of it). \nThe whole thing completely got blown out of proportion when a certain fandom got involved. They refused to acknowledge their wrong doings and continued to spread misinfo (while most of them not being Muslim I may add) and started painting RM in a negative light (to the point articles are covering it right now) In return we found one of their bandmate who had posted about bad religion too so that's where the petty fanwars started honestly. \nI find the whole thing quite frustrating, and I am quite upset right now since my religion is literally being mocked and thrown around as a joke among these people. Not only that, but the other fandom that started this is now pointing fingers at us for something we simply didn't even start. \nBTS or well, their fans are very diverse being from different countries, religion, gender, race, and identity, and just like that, are BTS' discography. It's very diverse with different music sounds and meanings, their struggles, their hopes, and their dreams, and 99% of the time, there is always a genre someone might like. They actually started as a hiphop group and took many inspirations form black artists and so they hold immense respect for them and have even paid respect to them on multiple occasions like saying their name or fashing their images in concerts or even collating with artists they grew up admiring (e.g J-hopes recent collab with J.cole). \nTO END THIS- THIS WHOLE SITUATION IS JUST EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING FOR US AS MUCH AS IT MIGHT BE FOR YOU GUYS HONESTLY CUZ IT FEELS WE'RE BEING WRONG ACCUSED OF STUFF \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d",

Any system that promotes division, hatred, discourages individual freedom and rational thinking is bad. Christianity is a bad religion too. Islam, however, takes the cake in many ways through its treatment of \"infidels\" and women. \n\nI think we should be able to say this and not be labelled as \"phobic\". Critique of a bad system is valid. Hatred of people that follow the system is not ok. Most are only there because they have been brainwashed into believing since childhood.

English has too few words and relies constantly on one size fit all words in a culture that doesn't really encourage people to make guesses off of context clues.\n\nFor example in my language \u30e6\u30c0\u30e4\u4eba is \"ethnically Jewish person\" and \"\u30e6\u30c0\u30e4\u4fe1\u8005\" is Jewish follower/believer.

                "Jewishness is neither religion nor ethnicity.  It's more of an agreement.  What makes this fun is that, of course, there's no such thing as Jews universally agreeing on anything (behold me disagreeing with you now :)  ).\n\nFor instance, a person descended from ancient Israelites is a Jew, whether or not they are religious. This is an ethnic Jew.\n\nA person that converted to Judaism is a Jew, whether or not they descended from ancient Israelites (yes, some of these people do need to convert, because religious rules.  Depends on whether it's paternal or maternal descent).  This is a religious Jew.\n\nA person that is descended from a mother that converted to Judaism is also a Jew, whether or not they are religious and whether or not that mom actually brought them up.  This is where it gets fun - you can have a Japanese atheist that's a Jew because his ethnically Japanese mother whom he's never seen was a Jew.  This is a Jew by agreement.\n\nAnd that means that some Jews are only Jews if they claim to be (like that Japanese atheist) or if someone claims it for them (if the Japanese atheist gets unlucky).\n\nWhich is why anyone that lives as a Jew, is a Jew, and most of us are not going to look too closely at their descent or religious views.\n\nBut this is also why \"lives as a Jew\" is a very fuzzy concept, and mainly involves just claiming to be a Jew in daily life.",

Additionally, religion can be used as breeding grounds for reactionary forces, terrorist groups, and other extremists, and those same terrorist groups will often get funding by the CIA as regime change operatives. Some Islamic terrorist groups the US has funded include the Mujahideen, ISIS, Al-Qaeda, and the ETIM.",

                "If we can get people to adopt dialectical materialism as their guiding philosophy, everything that is harmful or divorced from reality will eventually die out - if religion dies out, life goes on; if it doesn't, life goes on.\n\nWhat matters to me is the adoption of dialectical materialism, how people reconcile or merge religion with dialectical materialism (e.g God is even favour of whatever emancipates the oppressed and since DM brings us closer to the truth of the world, he is thus in favour of it), if they even do, is their business.\n\nThis is my stance because I know of religious people who are closer deisim than regular theism and are communists themselves and they regard their religious texts as a book chronicling mankind metaphorically rather than literally so in a way you can say the texts are transformed from being literal accounts of mankind's history to being treatises on moral philosophy written from the perspective of an oppressed group, in the case of the bible, the israelites - thus the goal is to find the essence of the religion by placing it in it's time period and appreciating the biases the people of that time had.\n\nFor example, one can argue that the israelites were opposed to homosexuality as it was a phenomenon that they saw being practiced by the Ancient Egyptians and Romans (coupled with the prevailing air of militarism, patriarchy and obssessive baby-making) so, as a way of drawing the line in the sand, they decided that which the oppressors engage in we shall avoid (another example would be the part of the bible where it is a sin to wear clothes of mixed fabrics).\n\nThis would be akin to what Steve Biko and the like said about avoiding that which is white as it would dilute our blackness, forster the desire to protect whiteness and approximate whiteness. Basically, an unsophisticated class consciousness which is aware that there things the privileged engaged in that the oppressed don't, but because its still sophisticated it has not learnt how to decipher what those things are. So it ends up pointing to every single difference as if it was reflective of privilege.\n\nThat's atleast how I view things.

                "Perhaps it had a use at one point, but religion is actively harmful to society. It is primarily used to oppress and enslave people. It hampers critical thinking, but it advocates for ideas that no one has ever empirically demonstrated, nor has a hope of demonstrating. \n\nAlso, religious leaders are and have often been immune or shielded from the law due to their status and privilege, often being or associating with the bourgeoisie. \n\nBelieving in fantasies and engaging in wishful thinking is why our world is such a shithole. In my opinion, we don't need any more ideas that almost certainly are not true muddying the waters, especially because science and technology are at a point where we don't need dumbass bronze -age myths to explain the world anymore. \n\nTo say nothing of the severe discrimination the religious visit on outsiders, and the special privileges society affords it. Religious violence in the Middle East and pre-Enligtenment Europe and US come to mind here...even today it persists in the US depending on location. Religion is incredibly intolerant. If you disagree, you're kind of wrong, and I'd invite you to ask Charlie Hebdo what they think of religious tolerance. \n\nIn short, religion is irrational, and I don't think any \"good\" socialist should be religious.

                "Religion is a range of social-cultural systems, including designated behaviours and practices,\nmorals, beliefs, worldviews, texts, sanctified places, prophecies, ethics, or organizations that\ngenerally relate humanity to supernatural, transcendental, and spiritual elements, although\nthere is no scholarly consensus over what  precisely constitutes a religion. Different religions may or may not contain various elements ranging from the divine, sacredness, faith, and a supernatural being or beings. Religious practices may include rituals, sermons,commemoration or Veneration (of deities or saints), sacrifices, festivals, feasts, trances,initiations, matrimonial and funerary services,meditation, prayer, music, art, dance, or publicservice. Religions have sacred histories and narratives, which may be preserved in sacred texts, symbols, and holy places, that primarily aim to give life meaning. Religions may contain symbolic tales that may attempt to explain the origin of life, the universe, and other phenomena; some followers believe these to be true stories Traditionally, both faith and reason have been considered sources of religious beliefs\n\nThere are an estimated 10,000 distinct religions\nworldwide, though nearly all of them have regionally based, relatively small followings. \n\nFour religions-Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism--account for over 77% of the world's\npopulation, and 92% of the world either follows one of those four religions or identifies as nonreligious, meaning that the remaining 9,000+ faiths account for only 8% of the population combined.

Typically in the context of Christianity or Islam.  This is baffling to me.  \n\nChristianity is dying out in Europe and has lost a third of its followers in the US in a few decades, mostly replaced by the nonreligious.  The churches are trying to compensate by exporting their faiths to the global south.  Lots of missionary work going on in sub Saharan Africa and Latin America right now pushing people in a reactionary direction.  Christianity is on its back foot right now.  Communists should be taking advantage of this.  A change in people's religion is the perfect time to effect a change in ideology.  And if there was ever a time to be unashamedly anti-christianity, now is the time to do it and win over all the formerly Christian queer people driven out by Christianity's homophobia, or all the women driven out by Christianity's opposition to reproductive health.\n\nIslam is different, as it seems to be in a bit of a historical upswing, but it was during a period of more secularization that we started to see Arab socialism try to take root.  And right wing governments use Islam to justify the oppression of women, queer people, and religious minorities.  Any influence which Islam has on government should be vigorously opposed for that reason.\n\nReligion doesn't have to be problematic though.  We should oppose religion where it is harmful but recognize when it is benign. It won't go away entirely, and some people will likely always need it to process things like death, or gain a sense of permanence by celebrating festivals or holidays their ancestors did.  When religion does not demand conversion or does not make a claim to universal truth, it can be a useful tool for people to make sense of their lives and take comfort.  Personally, I'm a pagan, but I don't need anyone else to believe it, and I don't believe there is some pagan text that has the answer to all creation in it.  I pray to the gods for help, and give thanks when something good comes my way.  Even if you look at it from a purely atheistic perspective, it still has some value as a meditative exercise or a way to stay humble by thanking universal forces for your successes instead of falling prey to that pernicious capitalist myth that everything good in your life is because you worked so hard.  I'm also told to make my own moral judgements instead of taking them from an institution run by bourgeoisie so my faith wouldn't contradict my socialism, and if it did, well there are lots of gods and I can find one more agreeable to our goals to focus my practice on.",

Especially fundamentalists in Judaism, very similar to christian fundamentalists\n\nUltimately though, I think what the USSR did with essentially forced athiesm was dumb as fuck though. Firstly, religious people generally believe their religion is holy and anything that tries to obstruct it is evil, so great start, and you can\u2019t just force people to stop believing something, hence secret meetings with other religious people and stuff. I like to believe religions can exist peacefully in society, but I think we need to destroy them as institutions because I think that\u2019s why we\u2019ve ended up where we have with the Catholic church. Fun fact, the papacy has too economic systems they say are good. Capitalism (nice edition) where it\u2019s capitalism but people don\u2019t fuck each other over and have empathy (lmfao) and Social Democracy. Anything left of that is bad according to a MASSIVE RELIGION WITH LOTS OF INFLUENCE. Also yoga is satanic",

They are material conditions, in that they have observable causes and effects, but mostly not economic ones. Religion, as a phenomenon, is just a part of a culture.\n\nReligious *institutions* can and often have been used as a tool of social control, hierarchy, and oppression. That should be curtailed. Religious organizations should be formed on an egalitarian, democratic basis, ideally for serving a given community rather than as subunits serving a larger authority.\n\nMy own beliefs about the gods is that they are not products of idealism, but are material (if incorporeal) beings that\u2013 just like us \u2013proceeded from the universe, and whose existence precedes their essence.",

As such, the majority of humans at any given time will always have some sort of spiritual or metaphysical inclinations, Hakim talks about this. As such, it will be impossible to get rid of religion even in a socialist world for at least a century (immediate guess, but around this time frame) with no setbacks, and you can bet a lot that there's going to be setbacks, so even longer.\n\nEssentially, even operating from an atheist POV, you need to work with religion. Over 80% of the proletariat is religious, and some of the world's most strategic areas on the planet, such as the MENA Region, are predominantly religious.\n\nHell, Ibrahim Traore, the current interim leader of Burkina Faso, is a practicing Muslim, and I know that almost no sane one here is going to bash him on that sole basis alone, given all he has done. It is simply idiotic to gatekeep communism and socialism from religious comrades when they've done more to spread it than nearly everyone in this sub.\n\nI know that there will be those telling me that my religion, and religion itself, is idealism. To me it isn't, I have my proofs for my religion that I feel are simply impossible through a materialist lens, as IDK how an illiterate man from the desert could have understood scientific disciplines developed in the 1960-70s.",

Take the spectrums of visible light and audible sound for example, but imagine that there are other vibrations and energies that we do not perceive. Is it outside the realm of possibility that there is consciousness in this space? There is so much that we still do not understand about the world. Religions mostly center on the testimony of those that through some exceptional circumstance claim to have glimpsed beyond the veil of perception. The religious measure others based on faith, but also on merit. The merit is the hands and feet of faith. We can judge a tree by its fruit. \n\nIf you do not agree that there are things we cannot perceive, there are substances and practices that can alter consciousness and experiencing such an altered consciousness may change your mind.

Causal believers generally use religion as an excuse for bigotry as they cherry-pick whatever they want. Fundamentalists are more likely to have bigoted beliefs because that's the way their cult interprets the text (often it's the most reasonable interpretation).\n\nReligion is not innately harmful (unless it's the Bible or Quran taken at face value), but the terrible epistemology one has in order to accept those beliefs is harmful because it means they aren't able to navigate their beliefs on the most basic level in a world with so much misinformation. They are basically forced to believe whatever their group believes (or change groups) because they don't have the mental tools (or time/energy/desire) to think for themselves. And their group (if not haphazardly arriving at their conclusions by random chance) is often manipulated by those who stand to gain from doing that. This creates a society that holds itself back from becoming better and making better decisions. For example, religious people are more likely to believe in economic policies that aren't best for themselves or people in general, they are more likely to believe in non-scientific or anti-social things that some discredited person is selling/promoting by appealing to their other false beliefs. This is how they often believe in disproven or unproven things that aren't even mentioned in the religious texts: miracle cures, climate change isn't real/problematic, anti-vax, alternative medicine, anti-abortion (extra-biblical theology may explain part of a Christian's anti-abortion, but it's not found in the bible like homophobia is).

                "\"The left fears to criticise Islam\" is such a funny statement. \n\nThe left criticises misuse of power. Islam doesn't have power in the US, UK, India yet political speeches against the religion are made regularly. It is in this context Islam is defended. Where Islam has power, it is heavily criticised: Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan. The religious nature of the groups abusing power is heavily and regularly critiqued.\n\nThe expectation that because police violence in Iran is being defended using Islam so the practitioners of the faith should be held responsible in other countries is a bad bad idea and intellectually dishonest. What would it look like if progressives in the US blue states start showing distrust of American Indians because of the actions of the Indian government that are being excused in the name of religion or Hindutva here?\n\nThe left critiques what needs critiquing. When the left talks of cow vigilantism, the excuses are given that \"what about the killing after Nupur's speech?\". But if you think for two minutes, you will see how the two aren't similar, the killer who killed because his prophet was insulted got the full force of the law. Cow vigilantes are not only free but meeting the ruling party.\n\nWhen protest is done about hate speeches or anti-Muslim violence, we get excuses of \"what about that violence or that speech\", SG Tushar Mehta even did the whataboutery in the Supreme Court. But the thing that he conveniently missed in his argument is the speech he used as an example, already led to FIR and legal action. Protest is done to ask the government to do something they do not want to do. It is not just protest for protest's sake. There is no point of protesting for legal action if the legal action has already taken place. \n\nTake an easy example: if a Bill like the Jan Vishwas Bill or the Right to Health Bill  at state level that just passed is about to be signed, there might be protests. Because the protest is asking the government to not do something they want to do or vice versa. A protest in support of the Bill makes no sense. Because it is already passed and will become law soon. So a protest in its favor means nothing since there is nothing to ask for. A protest is not just a bunch of people going out on the streets with slogans. A protest is supposed to have demands. And if it gets public support, the government interacts with the protesters and resolves their grievances. \n\nFor the same reason, people talk about crimes against Muslims like the people killed by the  railway officer recently because of the statements that came defending the shooter saying he has mental illness. If the railway hadn't released a statement and then retracted their statement, there wouldn't be an uproar. \n\nThe Manipur video was disgusting and it enraged a lot of people of all faiths. But if arrests had happened since the FIR was filed and not after the video got viral and the party started getting flake for it, it wouldn't still be in the news. \n\nNirbhaya case was horrific but the protests happened because people saw that the culprits will not get the punishment they deserve under the existing law. So protests happened, making a demand to change the law, and the law was changed. \n\nSome demands are made that we know are hard to get and some are easier depending on how the Parliament responds to the demands and it shows in the protests. The Jains protested their religious sites being turned into tourist spaces not so long ago. The demand was accepted. \n\nA few years there was another Bill which said penalty of rape will not be more than two years if the rape happens to a transgender person. That Bill was protested too, for many many years, from the draft to the day it was signed. But it became law. Coz the protests happened after amendments to make the rape punishment equal to punishment under the law that already exists was voted down so we knew it will be hard to stop it. And we failed. Yes, one could say there could have people who supported the Bill (a.k.a people who agreed with the government that enraging the modesty of an eunuch is not as bad as enraging the modesty of a woman) but those people shouldn't need to protest because they don't have a demand. The Bill passed. A pro-Bill protest means nothing. \n\nToday someone could protest that the law of domestic violence should be changed to make it gender neutral. That would be a protest, a hard one, too since the Parliament doesn't want to do it. But in any case, a pro-IPC 498 protest would mean nothing.\n\nThe no. of MPs that belong to the Islamic faith or parties ruling States that adhere to the faith is next to zero. If any Muslim does something illegal and he is roaming around free, there would be a case to protest. But if violence happened and the culprit got arrested, there is nothing left to protest So what exactly would the left criticise? The people that are not in power? \n\nCriticising the people who are not in power is a brain-dead act to do. Just like protesting in favor of Bills/laws that already exist is a brain dead act.",

                "It's a stupid argument. I am of Swedish ancestry and Christianity was basically forced on my ancestors too, lol. The Holy Roman Empire targeted the kings and the various polytheist priesthoods first for conversion and the rest of the people sort of had to follow. So it was forced on many white people too. And then a few centuries after we were Christianized we actually forced it on the Baltic peoples in the First Swedish Crusade. You have a similar result today: whites who speak about freeing themselves from Christianity and go back to their ancestral faiths; so this isn't exactly a problem solely related to colored people.\n\n Similarly my room mate is of Kenyan descent (descended from slaves brought to US, not a recent immigrant) and has spoken about these things.\n\nAt least, for him, he thought it was bad because his people were basically already practicing the Ga'ez Rite from Ethiopia.

Bad stuff happens, but it doesn't subtract from the substantial claim. It's kind of like how many people who were conquered by the caliphate (Berbers, for example) continue to hold on to Islam: they don't  see how the claim \"Arabs conquered you, therefore Islam is false\" is consistent logic.

Catholicism is most commonly associated with Hispanics and some Asian groups, which are obviously minorities. If anything, they're often ignorant of history, especially American history. Even Italians and Irish were reviled in the 1800's-1900's because they were Catholic and were basically considered \"non-whites\" until the modern era. Additionally, amongst white Americans, it's a bit of an anomaly to assume they're Catholic. Most would just be evangelical. This argument in general is from a person that swallowed one too many pop culture lies, especially if you consider the fact that we're talking Catholicism here. Protestantism and Catholicism have different problems, but they're still grouped together when it comes to criticisms.",

Also, there are people from all backgrounds, all ages, all professions, all classes, races, levels of income, and abilities. But yeah - it's really exclusive! Lol. \n\nWhat's interesting about this argument is that the attack comes from groups that preach inclusion but practice exclusion. Universities and corporations, where I have spent most of my adult life, are the most narrow band of human beings I've ever met. Corporate and university life are the two least diverse places I've ever encountered, but they try to tell us otherwise. It's a comedy, really. But they beat the drum loudly, I suspect, out of guilt. Unconfessed sin manifests in strange ways. \n\nIt's a bad argument but it comes from the victim mentality taught in our school system. I remember in third grade how the environment and whiteness guilt started being slathered on. What's funny to me now is we all learn about Catholic Guilt, but I received far more Guilt from the public school curriculum and media onslaught.

Is your interlocutor claiming that Christianity is true for white people but not for others, or that for anyone (including white people) to believe it would require brain washing?\n2. Given that Christianity was invented 2000 years ago at a time when current of notions didn't exist, it's anachronistic to talk about it as a \"White Man's\" religion. At least in the United States, up until pretty recently to be \"white\" was a subset of what we consider it today, with [many people from Europe being considered non-white](https://andscape.com/features/white-immigrants-werent-always-considered-white-and-acceptable/).\n3. While some of the spread of Christianity was due to leaders converting and wanting their people to have the same religion, a lot of Christianity's initial success for the first 300-or-so years was among the poor and oppressed.\n4. Modern secular atheism was unheard of anywhere, and has mostly spread outside Europe alongside Marxism. Does the fact that Marx was a White Man make his philosophy, or the spread of secular atheism on people who don't really want it, brainwashing people?\n5. \"slaves with stockholm syndrome\" As Thomas Sowell details in his books (particularly in Black Rednecks and White Liberals), Christianity provided the moral framework for eradicating slavery world-wide. Slavery didn't die out until Britain extinguished it in other countries (particularly Muslim countries around the Mediterranean Sea and Indian Ocean).",

The church explicitly condemns racism and makes the claim that all men are equal in dignity as images of God.\n\nAs for church history, the apostles and early church were Jews in judea.

                "Their argument is centered on the concept that all \u201cWhite\u201d people are the same and somehow harbor an innate desire to lord over other \u201cnon-white\u201d / \u201ccolored\u201d people, on a wide-sweeping historical scale, and that people of other \u201ccolors\u201d are brainwashed and thus incapable of greater levels of intellect, all of which is preposterous.\n\n\u201cWhite\u201d people have historically enslaved and mistreated other people of the same skin color, whether they be of a different nationality or the same. \u201cColored\u201d people have historically done the exact same, the transatlantic slave trade would not have been possible were it not for the native African slavers who sold other tribes into slavery. *People* have enslaved, lorded and mistreated other people and race has only been a passing excuse for it; if not race then physique, if not physique then wealth, if not wealth then religious criteria, etc.\n\nSo the crux of their argument is one already poorly informed, and I would hazard to guess that until they are convinced otherwise of the notion that White people are inherently evil or that there is some wide-sweeping desire by all people of a certain melatonin level to lord over people with a different melatonin level, then they will not be convinced of the Catholic Church\u2019s desire and historical efforts to make clear that all men, women and children are equal in inherent dignity and that all people, Gentile or Jew, are called by God to eternal life and joy.\n\nTo label all \u201cWhite\u201d people the same, while making distinctions between all other people of \u201ccolor\u201d is just another form of racism. The Scotts differ from the English, who differ from the French, who differ from the Dutch, who differ from the Germans, who differ from the Austrians, etc. People like to put other people in boxes but even people from two different towns merely 10 miles away from each other in the same nation will differ from each other, and an individual person is not the stereotype they are labeled with. Native Americans have different tribes, Africa is a bigger place than Europe with hundreds to thousands of individual communities, and even the people of Japan differ by province. Were the Medieval Muslims \u201cWesternized\u201d in their attempt to subjugate and conquer all of Europe? Were the Mongolians also \u201cWesternized\u201d in their conquest of China and Eastern Europe? Perhaps we should say the various Native American tribes were \u201cWesternized\u201d in their unceasing tribal warfare with each other before Westerners even showed up. Humans conquer humans, people harm people, race is not a cause, it is merely an excuse.\n\nBut to briefly make clear how just plainly incorrect their argument is regarding the Church, Christianity was not started by \u201cWhite\u201d people, it was started by the Jews, specifically Jesus Christ and His Apostles, who were all people from the Levant. Rome did not westernize Christianity, Christianity *Christianized* Rome and the resulting kingdoms that came about after Rome\u2019s collapse. The term \u201cCatholic\u201d literally means \u201cUniversal\u201d in Greek, and one of the very first things the first Christians did was establish the fact that Jesus Christ died for the salvation of ALL people \u201cGentile or Jew, slave or free, woman or man.\u201d *All* people are called, and whether people label you White, Black, Yellow, Red, Green, Blue etc. everyone who isn\u2019t a Jew by blood is a Gentile and both Jews and Gentiles are called by God; according to Catholicism we are all the same.\n\nAnd how exactly does the Catholic Church brainwash people of color? By having a wide multitude of Saints from all ethnicities and walks of life, many of whom held high ranks among the clergy? Perhaps it\u2019s the myriad of Papal Encyclicals which bluntly discuss the equal degree of respect and dignity due to all people of all nations, or the Papal decrees and encyclicals which declared automatic excommunication for those who enslaved natives of the New World during the spread of imperialism in the 15th and 16th Centuries? Maybe it could be the various efforts of the Medieval monks who terraformed Germany into farmable land and freely made available new technologies and universities to the people who neighbored them? Could it possibly be the fact that any time Jesus or Mary appear to a person they appear in the form of their given ethnicity, as if to say all of humanity, regardless of race, is welcome in the Church?\n\nWhile I cannot speak to certain forms of Protestantism, which I see as the only potentially reasonable origin of their misconceptions of Christianity, the notion that Catholicism is somehow a \u201cwhite man\u2019s religion\u201d is entirely false and there are 2000 years of historical evidence to prove as much if they ever decide to take a serious look into it.\n\nAs for actually convincing them as much, I would encourage them to take the time to look into actual Church history and historical documents (all of which are available in a multitude of translations online) and consider how their current notion of White vs Not-White is illogical and just another form of the same racism I assume they propose to despise.\n\nWhile I have implied certain assertions regarding their belief behind Christianity being a \u201cwhite man\u2019s religion,\u201d I am curious how exactly they think the Catholic Church preys upon people of color exclusively, if you do follow up with them.\n\nIn either case, you and they will be in my prayers as while I could go at length in this argument the best we can truly do is pray for all involved in earnest. In my experience, while we can help defend the faith in debate and discussion, it is ultimately up to God to soften their heart and draw them to Him, and I honestly hope they do accept that invitation to eternal life.",

The slaves were kept here in these dark and ill-ventilated spaces, amid their own excrement and vomit, with food dumped over them from an overhead hatch, for up to three months. Occasionally the dead among them were removed. The slave trade was so immensely profitable, it could cope with a high death rate among the captives \u2013 it is estimated that some thirty percent of them died in these cells before the passage across the Atlantic, and many more on the passage itself.\"\n\nAnd, another reason people bring that up is because during slavery, slavemasters forced Christianity and forbade practicing of our ancient spiritual traditions.\n\nhttps://www.thirteen.org/wnet/slavery/experience/religion/history2.html \n\nThis is a well known fact and why there is so much interest in retracing those steps, learning about ancient traditions, etc. It's one of many reasons why colonization, genocide, and slavery are so abhorrent because the oppressors rob us of our culture, history, our language, even our names.\n\nIt's very distressing. \n\nOf course, that's Black folks but the same could be said throughout the Americas regarding Portuguese and Spanish enslavement, colonization, and genocide.",

As for racism in Catholic Church, yes there were Jesuits who helped preserving native languages and many good examples but a huge part of its doings was very racist. The clearest example of it that everybody can see today, is that when people of Europe were christianised, their names entered Christian name cannon, even names coming from pagan gods(!), a lot of roman names, a lot of germanic names, a few slavic names. But after Christianisation of other continents, people were given European names, and even saints from those countries are venerated by names from Europe. I'm asking why almost all natives in Mexico are given Spanish names?! It's clear evidence for white supremacy over other nations.

Most Arabs also seem to be basically Caucasian which is a whole other topic so although not \"White\" as we think of it in terms of being from Europe but certainly racially they are more related to White than Black or Asian.\n\nAlso it was Muslim Arabs who established the slave trading system throughout Africa they just colonized it prior to the  - they started it prior to Europe, continued long after Europe and North America stopped using it and the evil system of West African slavery used by the west was part of the larger system established by the Muslims.\n\nBoth Islam and Christianity banned the owning of slaves of their own religion respectively and took far too long to come to the conclusion that all slavery is evil which is tragic. Both allowed for owning Black people as slaves and Islam made exceptions to their own rule to allow for owning even Muslim Blacks based on Hammite theology which has also been used by some racist Christian groups.\n\nSo it is definitely not a consistent, well thought out idea but is more of a reaction based on current cultural perceptions. You will notice that Europe has had to practically self destruct and all White people world wide have had to bow their heads in sorrow and fear of the nazi ghost but you will also notice that Japan which had a similar ideology to the nazis have not had to apologize, they have not had to lay down their culture in reparation, Japanese do not have to answer for racism and as a whole their country is very xenophobic and maintains a sense of cultural an racial purity that would never be tolerated in the west.\n\nSo it is along the same lines where it is simply okay to blame White people for legitimate problems but only White people and no one else.",

                "This is particularly a historical black American thing. If your family is from Kenya, your ancestors probably converted as a result of the efforts of missionaries, spreading the gospel. Specifically if your family is Catholic, their conversion probably had nothing to do with slavery, or even with the colonial governments of that time. In fact, some of the first East Africans to convert in the era of French missionary activity were former slaves in Zanzibar.\n\nChristianity was not spread in Africa at the behest of colonial governments, it was spread through the efforts of committed Christians from all over the world, from the US to India, traveling to the continent to preach the Good Word. And the good people of those regions ended up being very receptive, thanks be to God.\n\n\nNow, were there areas of the world where Christianity was spread by the sword? Yes, but that was the exception and not the rule, and it wasn\u2019t a practice that was looked highly upon by the Church.\n\nThe conversion of the Muslims in Spain is probably the most famous example. As well, the early history of Spanish colonization in the Americas involved forced conversions before law and order could be established. However, many more conversions were the result of opportunism, or of the activities of later missionaries.\n\nOf course, the slave trades were another area of compelled conversion, which the Church struggled to deal with for centuries. Successive Popes over centuries would make many attempts to restrict or ban the practice, first of enslaving non-Christians, then of natives and later in general, but the Catholic states in the Americas consistently found ways to ignore the Church\u2019s statements, or else to use their power to prevent enforcement.\n\nThere\u2019s always enough gray area when there\u2019s money to be made.\nHowever, even considering this, conversion to Christianity was considered a mercy to the enslaved. It afforded them some additional rights, and of course, the opportunity to receive the Lord\u2019s mercy and grace.\n\nThe goal of providing for the enslaved to convert was not to \u201crob them of their African heritage\u201d or anything like that. It was the salvation of souls, even if their bodies were held in captivity.",

There may be some options like secular community service groups or sports teams, but religion, even if it imaginary and based on tradition rather than an actual deity, offers rituals and practices that help a lot of people find solace and make connections they wouldn't otherwise make.",

                "> Can we just call religion what it actually is?\n\nJust a note that any sentence that begins with \"can we\" and involves atheists, usually is going to be answered in the negative unless the rest of the sentence is \"not believe in gods\".\n\nCan you do that?  Sure.  Go ahead.  Not that you need my permission, but if you hypothetically did, you have it.\n\nWill I do that?  Probably not.  While I agree that religion does involve indoctrination, manipulation, and coercion, I don't think there's a lot of utility in changing labels.  Not only is it a mouthful to say \"Oh you belong to the Christian system of indoctrination, manipulation and coercion\", but it's also not much of a way to have a useful conversation with somebody that is religious.  They don't think they have been indoctrinated, manipulated or coerced, so starting off like that is likely to just make them defensive and not listen to what I have to say.  In which case my talking to them in the first place is kinda pointless.\n\n> They are making these choices because they are afraid of punishment if they don\u2019t. It\u2019s completely moronic!\n\nHere I'd also avoid the term moronic.  I think we can both agree that religion is wrong.  But that doesn't mean that people believing that religion are necessarily innately less intelligent.  On average, sure.  Metastudies have shown that religious people have a small but statistically notable lower IQ rating.  But, and this is important, people who leave religion often recover those lost IQ points.  Which leads me to believe that while religion may impair your ability to think, it doesn't fundamentally alter your innate cognitive function.\n\nAnd further, that's an average.  A below average atheist is still going to likely not be as intelligent as an above average theist as the spread on IQ points isn't really all that huge.\n\nSo if theists aren't actually morons, why do they believe such obviously moronic things?  There I think you've actually answered that question.  They've been indoctrinated, manipulated, and coerced into believing those things.  They believe moronic things because they've been trained to believe moronic things.  Often by the people they love and trust most in the world.",

I respect her rules for her house and we generally got on very well. She knew I was an atheist, we just never spoke about it.\n\nUntil we did.\n\nHer, my BFs brother, my BF and I were at a restaurant eating lunch. It had been a really pleasant day and everyone was in a good mood. At this point, I had been dating my BF for about 6 months so I was still getting to know his mom. I knew she was important to him so I was doing my best to make good impressions. \n\nOut of nowhere, she says \"so, tell me why you decided to be an atheist?\" Which was a little....weird for me. It did not help that my BF immediately said \"I have to go to the bathroom\" and just left me there alone (don't worry, he got an earful later because serious wtaf?). I politely explained to her that I went to church and did Bible study as a child, but as I grew up, I found i was more and more looked down on by the community and I just could not drink the kool-aid anymore. There were a lot of bad things that happened to me, the details aren't necessary here, but I did explain it to the mom. I had decided that God probably didn't exist and if it did, it knew I was a good person because I have empathy and generally put out good.\n\nWhen I was done, she said \"you're just so smart, I don't know how you could believe something like that.\" I found that incredibly insulting.\n\nSo I said \"funny, I feel the same way about you.\"\n\nOur relationship is no longer good. Somehow what I said was over the line, but what she said was not. I haven't said anything else about her religion but she has tried to get me to go to church with them a few times since then.\n\nI don't think I'm a brown starfish for this, but there have been those who said I should have been more respectful. I don't see how I'm responsible for being respectful of her beliefs when she isn't responsible for being respectful of mine. AITAH?\n\nETA: Holy moly, I did not expect to be this popular. I wanna address the BF.\n\nWhile the timing was terrible on my BFs part, he had just been diagnosed with IBS and we were still working on finding out what foods he could have. It is very plausible that he actually had to go to the bathroom, he was just being a brozo and not listening to the conversation that was occurring. He is not Mormon anymore and is more agnostic than anything. He also has issues with the church. Not just mormon, organized religion.\n\nI also want to make it clear that I don't have a problem with her being religious. I have religious friends. To each their own. What I mind is when my lack of faith is disrespected. This is one hill I am willing to die on.",

But my story focuses on me and my mother's parenting choices, with no negativity towards religion.  I have complicated and mostly negative views on organized religion, but I generally keep that to myself.\n\nI was raised in a secular household, because my mother had attended Catholic school as a child, where they had abused her badly.  She decided to raise me without religion, despite everyone else in the family being Catholic.  By the time I started learning about organized religion, I was an outsider, and atheism was the default.\n\nFor me, the wizard of Oz never had a curtain to hide behind.  Religion was so obviously false that it confused me why anyone believed these things.  I used to be a huge asshole about it, but I rarely talk about religion with strangers anymore.  I find it's generally unproductive.\n\nIt was a unique upbringing and most people don't even know how to respond to it.  I try to discourage people from engaging in a debate about religion, because it won't be pretty.  I have a degree in philosophy, I study ancient history, the occult, and run rhetorical circles around them.  They end up resorting to persona attacks and get angry, while I relax, laugh and enjoy the discussion.\n\nI'm not trying to convince anyone, I just like talking about ideas and poking holes in bad arguments.

It is a tradition that has been a part of my family and my community for as far back as anyone knows.  I love the holidays, high church pomp and circumstance, & the community. But my faith has never lead me to believe that this faith I was born into is the only path.

The KJB Bible also condemns heterosexual activities, but does that mean heterosexual  sex is wrong? No, but it depends in context. Newer versions of the Bible are corrupt have been mistranslated to push an agenda. My theory is that the devil who is very real doesn\u2019t want the gay community to be saved from eternal hell which is also very real. The simple way of getting saved permanently is by believing the gospel which is found in. 1 Corinthians 15 1-4 KJB. Once you believe the gospel (which is free gift of God that is only received by faith alone) and that alone for your salvation you are permanently saved forever and nothing can snatch you out of the fathers hand no matter what you do.

                "first of all lets not confuse hating on religious people with hating on the religion itself.\n\npersonally, the reason i hate religion(specifically the abrahamic ones) is mainly for their menipulative nature. they offers forgiveness for everything, as long as you accept them(them being the worshipped figure in the religion), that's certainly a temping thing isn't it? it also controls people with fear, mostly with hell-related things.\n\nanother thing is the religions encourage people to spread them, even where they're not wanted. in islam they even encourage forcing it upon people, which is part of the reason there is so much islamic terrorism.\n\nthis one is again, mostly an islam problem(although there are parts of other religions where it's a thing as well) there is no age of consent, and Muhammad was a literal pedophile.\n\nanother obvious thing is homophobia, now, i know that the bible says that hating is bad(although it's not really as simple as that, you can read this article for more info https://www.gotquestions.org/Bible-hate.html) but it also calls homosexual acts a \"sin\" which is melicious in itself, of course that's because sins are bad, but it also gives people an \"excuse\" to hate on gay people, and everyone knows that if you give people a reason to hate on a minority, they will.\n\nin judaism, the jews are the \"chosen people\" and even \"the holy people\" which can be an obvious cause for racism.\n\ni will admit that i do have a certain attitude towards religious people(not really hate, just not wanting to be with them) this is because they were either born into a religious family, and don't realise how important it is to doubt your beliefs or fundamentals, are easily manipulated, or are just stupid, i mean have you read the bible? it is BATSHIT INSANE, there is absolutely bo proof of any of that stuff existing, and the amount of plot holes is insane.\n\nif i said anything incorrect I'd like you to correct me.",
                "I have nothing against religious people. I would, however, prefer if my closest ones (mostly a partner) were to be atheist, because it would not come into contrast with my own ideology. I do not believe in God in the slightest and, when going to church either as a kid because my parents wanted me to, or when attending a funeral, I found myself very much against a lot of principles preached by the church. My grandma has tried multiple times to convert me to Catholicism and she gets insanely mad when I say that I do not have any faith and I would rather if this conversation didn't happen with my partner.\n\nAlso, I am utterly disgusted by the sheer amount of pain that religion had caused in the course of History.\n\nNonetheless, I fully respect anyone's belief and think anyone should be free to express their opinion. I see it kind of like veganism in some way. You wanna be religious/vegan? Please, go ahead, but do not try to force it onto me like it's the only way to live, because it's not. You can talk to me about how great you feel in having faith, how it helps you get through troubles in life or give me your pov on the world's origin, I'll listen and probably be interested. \n\nJust don't come to me saying that MY way of thinking is wrong just because it's different from yours; because that's how the most useless conflicts happened. \nAnd yes, this statement applies to anything: atheists, Buddhists, Christians, vegans, Shintoists... \n\nJust be respectful everybody",

She doesn\u2019t hate the religion or anything she just didn\u2019t think it was for her. We met about a year and a half ago and have been together for a year. When we met she was still questioning and then about five months ago she decided it was official, she was agnostic. She didn\u2019t tell her parents all this time cause she wanted to be 100% sure. \n\nAt the beginning of this week, we were out and saw her mum. She came up to us and started talking and asked who I was since we hadn\u2019t met before. My girlfriend started stuttering and I took matters into my own hands and told her mum that I was her boyfriend and that she was no longer part of the religion she was in. Both my girlfriend and her mum were caught off guard. My girlfriend asked why did I say that. I told her that it\u2019s been a while since she decided she wasn't Muslim anymore and we\u2019ve been together for so long and since she wasn\u2019t worried about her relationship with her parents after telling them she didn\u2019t have to wait anymore.\n\nMy girlfriend and her mum walked away and chatted and her mum was shocked and said it\u2019ll take time but that it\u2019s okay and she\u2019s just happy my girlfriend is happy. So I thought things turned out great. \n\nLater on, my girlfriend messaged me to say I was out of line and it wasn\u2019t the time or place for me to say something that wasn\u2019t my place to say. She was going to tell her parents privately when she was ready. I told her things turned out fine. She said I was an arse and it was untrustworthy. Later her siblings and friends who all already knew too messaged me to say the same thing that I was a coward who couldn\u2019t keep my mouth shut. \n\nSo even though things turned out fine AITA?\n\n\nSince so many people are asking. I\u2019m not on the spectrum. My girlfriend is Pakistani Muslim (well was Muslim now atheist) and I am white. We are both 24. Her parents still love her",

Hinduism\u2019s views on homosexuality range from celebration to slight disapproval, but Hindu/Buddhist/Sikh texts are never binding and are supposed to be seen as guidelines that you are allowed to disagree with.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t entirely accepted but also not looked down upon. There is a lot of rich literature from ancient India about homosexuality and gender diversity (e.g. transgender warriors, male gods marrying and producing a child, half man/half woman god interpreted as gender fluid, Kamasutra has entire chapters dedicated to homosexuality). The Ayurveda, an ancient Indian text on medicine and surgeries acknowledges that homosexuality is natural and denounces any kind of conversion\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_history_in_India#:~:text=The%20LGBTQ%20community%20has%20a,transphobic%20laws%2C%20thus%20criminalizing%20homosexuality\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinduism_and_LGBT_topics\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_themes_in_Hindu_mythology",

Before their influence, same-sex behavior have always been an accepted part of human nature, although mostly in forms that aren't accepted by modern moral standards, but that were useful and an integral part of past societies, same as it is with the rest of the animals.",

Sodom & Gomorrah is actually about hospitality and rape than what we now call sodomy. The lesbian warrior couple in the book of Ruth exchange vows usually used by married couples. Christ healing the Roman soldier's \"slave boy\". What is now interpreted as anti-homosexuality is actually a fairly recent interpretation of the scriptures.",

                "From what I've learned, a lot of \"homophobia\" in many middle eastern religions like the Abrahamic religions comes from the fact that these groups wanted to separate themselves from other religious groups. It was very common in pagan religions to have homosexual rituals within their religions, so they wanted to distance themselves from those kinds of things, just as they distanced themselves from certain foods, certain clothing, and certain ways of worshiping their god. \n\nThose eventually evolved into a belief that banning homosexuality was not only something to separate them from others, but in fact a declaration from god that homosexuality is evil and unnatural, and obviously that then evolved into hatred. It could've easily went any other way, but thats how it ended up.",
                "So as someone else pointed out, it probably has to do with reproduction to grow an empire. More babies means more followers means dominant religion. It also means more people the church can take money from. Not enough people view religion as a business imo and their goal is to get more butts in the pews and altars to make more money.\n\nGay sex obviously does not make babies, so they don\u2019t like that obviously. They also hate contraceptives and abortion because that\u2019s also preventing more babies from being born. They view sex as something you should never do for pleasure, but ONLY for reproduction purposes.\n\nAnother thing I once saw on tiktok (not the best source but anyways) about the Duggar family from 19 kids and counting. Turns out their whole show was major conservative right wing christian propaganda and a lot of people didn\u2019t know at the time. The Duggars were used as an example in this video because the excuse Christianity gives for why you need to have more babies and only have sex to make babies is because some day the rapture will happen and Satan will return to earth. These children will be soldiers of God\u2019s army. They view children not as their own people but eventual soldiers to carry God\u2019s message and help fight any evil that would oppose God\u2019s will.\n\nTLDR:\nGay sex = no babies = no soldiers of God = Evil wins = Gay is evil\n\nBut really\n\nGay sex = no babies = no butts in church = no money = greedy rich people die poor",

A society in which being without a partner can mean literal death this makes sense. Being in another relationship than with your wife has the risk of you leaving your wife to her own devices, which is, frankly, a dick move.\n\nPatriarchy as a the whole basis of religion plays a huge role: Men are superior to women, and women like men, so a man liking men, or even a feminine man, is like a woman, meaning inferior. That's treason on your male sex/gender and subsequently forbidden. That's a bit of an oversimplification but that's the short version of it.\n\nAlso, gay relationships on equal footing where practically unheard of in ancient times, so our own version of homosexual relationships doesn't really apply to the laws of an ancient religion but whatever, fanatics won't care about that.",

I guess the better question is what sort of circumstances or conditions existed in said culture at the time said religion was established. Maybe look into Judaism and religious/cultural beliefs that came before it. \n\nI think other posters are on track when they talk about how these societies organized themselves in terms of inheritance, division of labour, marriage, child custody, land ownership rights, reproduction, etc. The answer lies here.\n\nKeep in mind that both Christians and Muslims have not always been homophobic at all points in history.

Going back to at least 300 A.D. when Emperor Constantine decreed that Christianity would be the unifying religion in the Byzantine Empire, at a point his kingdom was fractured into pieces as his subjects practiced five different religions.  He then sent his mother, the Empress Helena on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem and the Holy Land to visit important sites from the life of Jesus.  He then established Christian churches to proselytize the Christian faith among his subjects and requested that the clergy stressed \u201csocial norms\u201d that contributed to the stability of the cities and  villages throughout his kingdom in return for establishing and building the churches.  At that point in history, kings needed populations to be able to have enough soldiers if war should ever break out, so stressing marriage between a man and woman to procreate was a strategy more  to increase the population of the kingdom as opposed to anoint the blessing of a man and woman in marriage as sacred, effectively deeming intimate relationships between persons of the same sex as immoral and against the will of God.  But it was a STRATEGY, not a DOCTRINE.   And over 1700 years, those viewpoints became instilled as beliefs rather than perspectives.",

                "Abrahamic religion comes from a culture that's highly male dominant (the Semitic culture). Homosexuality = less children (in their mindset) and less children mean vulnerability so they discourage it. Also, they have highly male dominant culture, so anything that looks 'feminine' to them (like homosexuality is to them) is viewed as cultural deviance and weaknesses. \n\nNot to mention that Abrahamic religion needs to distinguish themselves from more 'accepting' cultures like Roman, Greek, Sumerian and probably even Egyptian. So they need to appeal to these sentiments more. I think the first law condemning homosexuality comes from Akkadian Empire, which was Semitic ethnic. \n\nWe cannot diverge religion from culture. Semitic culture is and has always been very 'macho'-y and patriarchal with highest ideal being 'masculinity', hence belief system originate from them are highly patriarchal and condemn anything that doesn't uphold to this ideal as well.\n\nMany religions in the world are at least neutral to homosexuality. Buddhism is chill (I'm Thai, so I know what I'm talking about), Shinto is super chill, Hinduism is based, many ethnic groups in Asia and America have third gender and accept homosexuality, Voodoo faith of Haiti accepts homosexuality if I remember correctly. But it's the homophobic ones that are louder and more influential - Abrahamic faith, Daoism, North African folk religions, etc. So they influence these cultures to be less accepting as well. \n\nLike ... in Indonesia, Bugis people celebrate homosexuality. But the pressure of Islamic culture challenges this a bit. Same goes for Southern Thailand - gays and trans are accepted but some radical Muslims just hate them. I feel for our brothers who live in these places. I wish the organizations (like Rainbow Railroad) that works with helping them are more effective at extricating them from these hell holes.

                "I have been reading a really good book recently called the Church and the Homosexual by John J. McNeill, who puts a lot of the OT ethics in context. I can't explain it as well as he did, but basically Jewish culture at that time defined itself heavily against neighbouring cultures (Canaanites etc.). From what I have read the academic consensus is that the Jewish God was originally part of a polytheistic pantheon and for various political/historical reasons the Jews began to focus on one God, Yaweh, and began to see themselves as a separate group. This means there was a heavy emphasis on reproduction and continuing the Jewish people. It was not just homosexuality that was forbidden, celibacy, impotency and eunuchs were also shunned. Hence the polygamy and emphasis on reproductive sex. Additionally, many of the neighbouring polytheistic cultures had temple rituals which included ritualised sex (both heterosexual and homosexual) which the Jews associated with idolatry. Hence the homosexual = sin connection. Naturally, they didn't have the understanding of sexual orientation that we do today; they most likely understood same sex activity as ritualised sex to please a false deity.\n\nNaturally, these views also influenced Christianity and Islam too. Christianity in particular, was very deeply influenced by Greek thought which basically saw the 'spirit' as good, and the body as bad, which is a Platonic idea, as well as Stoic ideas of controlling the passions. If you read some of the early church fathers views on sex in general it really is quite disturbing reading. Even enjoying sex with your spouse was considered sinful; sex was purely for procreation and was to be passionless and disinterested. They also had (to our minds) strange views on biology in which they believed that semen contained a whole child and that a woman was simply a carrier. Thus masturbation and non-procreative sex was equated with murder. You can still see this in modern Catholicism. The church now recognises the unitive and as well as the procreative role of sex in marriage, but masturbation, contraception, oral sex, and homosexuality are still sins.\n\nThe are plenty of Christians these days who don't think this however - the Quakers wrote some pretty progressive stuff back in the 1960s. But the Judeo-Christian understanding of world has influence civilisation massively, and with colonialism - a large part of the rest of the world. There are some very good aspects to this, but unfortunately sex is not one of them. Although I have heard it argued that the gay rights movement and modern equality movements have their roots in Christian values surrounding the dignity of every man and helping the marginalised. Food for thought at least.\n\nEDIT: I should also add the obvious fact that sexual orientation as we now understand it was completely foreign in biblical times and has only been around since the 1890s. This does not mean that there were no homosexuals of course, but people thought very differently.",

Some religions conquered large sections of the globe to sustain their numbers (Christianity and Islam), while others encouraged families to make as many babies as possible (dozens of examples of that one).

Leviticus goes as far as saying menstruating women should remain in a tent outside the village until the bleeding stops, which would also mean a couple is avoiding intercourse during the least fertile week of the month.\n\nAs others have said, the dharmic religions (Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, and Sikhism) do not have explicit prohibitions on gay sex, and most of them recognize transgender people in their scriptures. That doesn't mean countries that practice those faiths accept homosexuality culturally, though. In Southeast Asian countries (especially Thailand), being transgender is more easily accepted than having a same sex relationship.\n\nSection 377 of the British penal code banned sodomy and gay sex, and was drafted into the laws of most of the British colonies in the 1800s. Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, and Malaysia still have these laws on the books from their colonial past. Singapore only repealed theirs last year!\n\nA lot of the time, it is religion. But sometimes, it has nothing to do with religion.",
                "So the main reason is that the entire purpose of religion is procreation, passing down their terms of social coordination, rules and control.  impressing upon their believers that homosexuality is an unnatural and subversive deviation from these terms, makes it easier to hate what they don\u2019t understand.

Societies attempted to limit contact, mitigate risks, and reduce partners down to their ideal: 1 very, very fruitful marriage bound by law.\n\nEDIT: Should add that it's also just nonconforming behaviour, like being left-handed or having different coloured hair.

The thing is while religion is considered the epidome or the main root for homophobia, its really not, its a cultural issue. It always have been, its never been about the religion, thats just used as moral judgement call by the people who practicr those religion to validate their own biased opinion. \n\nHomophobia exists even among atheists or non-abrahamic religion, people who dont really believe in religion or practice it. People really just use religion as a scapegoat because its widely practiced around the world.\n\nIm atheist, and i know that the bible, the quran, and torah were all written by men at those time, how do you think those men came up with those rules, they inspired by god? No, they based it off the culture they were living in. This is mainly why most homosexual punishment seems to explicitly focus on the man such as \" man who lies with another man\"  and not as much on women etc.\n\nThere is one fundamental reason why that is: it emasculate the role of men, they dont like the idea that  some men engage in what they considered \" feminine\" role ( sucking dick, getting dicked) , this is the reason why a lot of men back them get repulsed by it, because they value their masculinity. Even now its the same thing,  when i talk with male homophobes, they just hate homosexuality and when asked why its usually because they have this idea that it just made of fem guys or it encourages feminity, and most men want to be traditional masculine, so when they hear or see exlsuively feminity being promoted that, even without knowing anything about the community they will just get repulsed by it.  They see the community as a parrallel to feminism\n\nMost men in average naturally do not like being emasculated from their male role. Its a pill thats hard to swallow.

I can\u2019t think of the passages off the top of my head, but as others have noted, there were specific prohibitations related to relationships between men and boys, which had some cultural practice in certain greek and roman circles. \n\nA lot of modern religions stem from texts and beliefs that aimed to distance themselves from these religions - think monotheism vs polytheism as an example - and so it tracks that this is something specifically outlined as a reaction to ancient religions and their practices at the time. over the years, these texts are translated and mistranslated to ensure that whoever is in power is able to use religious doctrine to support their laws.\n\nthe family unit is a relatively modern conception, given that ideas of family often extended beyond what we consider the nuclear family. it goes to reason that to ensure that newer ideas of family are upheld it almost necessitates homophobia to ensure that social order is followed. i think we see this a lot in the homophobia of today, when bigots often cite family as a reason to support their views.",

When people go outside of these rules that have been deemed beneficial by the group they are punished or killed. This process mimics Darwinian theory in terms of fittest survives, in terms of society the fittest were the ones who benefited the group. \n\nHistorically you woke up everyday running the risk of dying from starvation, war, disease and a whole host of things that we do not struggle with now as a society. If a society would wish to maximise its growth and health it normally ostracizes individuals not deemed fit and who do not contribute as much the obvious example is those who traditionally became physically crippled. Before modern society that person became a burden depending on the handicap and people who were crippled were looked down upon. If a societies imperative would therefore be to grow and become as powerful as possible it might theoretically deem homosexuality as unproductive for the group and seek to ostracize this behaviour although there is some sociological evidence that homosexuality might play a role in biological populations. I believe there was some evidence from pacific island populations about whether homosexuality plays a biological purpose in a group.\n\nThe current religions developed after society developed so they probably picked up on these older cultural practices. \n\nA good contrast to acknowledge this theory is to look at societies who do not focus on growth of the population. Certain faiths, cultures, and indigenous groups who lived traditionally more in line with nature sometimes believed in things like two spirit. But in this case not focused on growth of the group individuals who may not participate in biological reproduction but still be socially productive may not be seen as an issue.",
                "I have no direct evidence to support my theory, but my best guess is that homosexuality doesn\u2019t contribute to procreation. From my limited education in history/ social studies, it seems like after the black plague in the renaissance period, the main focus was rebuilding larger and stronger communities. \n\nTo my knowledge there wasn\u2019t much anti-homosexual culture before the idea of populating a larger society. So it makes a little bit of sense that people who were exclusively homosexual, were targets of community leaders, which back in the day were mostly religious groups.",
                "I heard, I don't know if it's true. That the person who translate the Bible to Spanish (I'm Mexican) was a pedophile And everything in the Bible that was against pedophilia I change it for homosexuality, I have never read the Bible and I am not a religious person, so I do not know if this is true or not. But here's what I heard",
                "It lies mostly in reproduction. Religions want to grow, because having larger numbers allows that religion more political power. It should be obvious from recent events in the US that religions have the capacity to influence how their followers vote, which is why you see so many politicians trying to curry favor with them. Then there's also the fact that many of those same politicians are themselves followers of the religion (even if they repeatedly violate the teachings...) \n\nThis is why many religions have teachings along the lines of \"be fruitful and multiply\" to encourage their followers to have as many children as possible. This directly results in the religion growing in size and power. It is also the reason for the contradiction of why many of them value chastity, yet are also against asexuality, as this quote from a Christian magazine reads:\n\n>\"Question: What do you call a person who is asexual? Answer: Not a person. Asexual people do not exist. Sexuality is a gift from God and thus a fundamental part of our human identity. Those who repress their sexuality are not living as God created them to be...\"\n\nThis reasoning also explains why even some secular countries such as Russia are against gays, lesbians, and even asexuals, because they need to ensure their population keeps growing so they have enough bodies for their military.\n\nThen you also have the fact that homophobes will project their hatred onto their religion, allowing them to justify it to themselves by framing it as being morally correct and absolving themselves of any responsibility by shifting the origin of these beliefs to the religion itself, even if the homophobia stems from something like misogynist men being afraid that gay men would treat them the same way they treat women.",
                "Maybe cuz your job as a follower is to create more followers!  That's why religious doctrines usually promote conversions and large families and, why Catholicism prohibited contraception.",
                "Back in the day reproduction was important.  around 30% of kids would die before the age of 10 because of lack of resources. The society didnt have the spare resources to feed people who would not reproduce. The past was horrible."

Had you said Christianity instead of Islam, people on the sub wouldn't even see it as controversial. Same goes for violent aspects of BLM and Anrtifa.\n\nI think it's because left leaning people want to make it very clear that they do not hate Muslims, but they often do it at the expense of genuine criticism. I think it's possible to criticize Islam while at the same time realizing that one should not be bigoted.\n\nAlthough I would make it clear that the title is way too much of a generalization. There is, after all, a HUGE difference between Anatolian Alevis and Shia Ismailis  compared to the Islam of ISIS, for example. The former are more open minded and mystical than modern Western Christians while the latter are complete medieval barbarians.

            "selftext": "**I am NOT OP. Original post by** u/AboutToBeTaken21 **in** r/legaladvice\n\ntrigger warnings : >!Religion, cults, attempted abduction!<\n\nMood spoilers : >!Positive for OP, less so for their siblings.!<\n\n[original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/ccd4vh/fl_my_parents_have_joined_some_new_age_religion/) \\- July 12th 2019\n\nSo I really don't know how to start this so i'll get right too it.\n\nMy mom and step dad are really into \"new age\" science and beliefs. I've never agreed with them on this and didn't know how extreme it was. Recently though they have become involved in a extremely weird \"support group\". I say that in quotes because I have no fucking clue who they are. When I'm around they never mention any group names or what \"organization\" they work for or are apart of. Because of this I have not had much luck finding out stuff as \"new age cult\" gives to many results to look into.\n\nThis Monday my mom and stepdad sat me and my 4 siblings down. They told us that we will be moving at the end of the month to a more \"stable\" location within a spiritual community. According to them they plan to pull all 5 of us (im 16, couldn't think of anywhere else to mention this.) out of school here and enroll us in their \"mind awakening\" school where ever we move. I tried to get anything out of them but they refused to talk to me at all about it. According to them because i'm still a child in \"mind, body, and spirit\" i need to listen to them not ask questions. I've actually been freaking out since then and have been trying to get advice but I've been unable too. They cut of the internet, phone and TV Tuesday and they have been keeping a fucking lazer focus on me and my siblings since then. I'm currently at a friends house and this is the only way I've actually got access to the internet. this seems like a cult 100% to me. Last night they had 3 people come and talk to me and my siblings and the stuff they told us was fucking crazy. I was talked to alone by an old man who told me about how my mind is \"closed\" and that I will slowly learn to open it as my parents have and that the \"leaders\" will love to meet me and put me in their programs.\n\nI need to know what the fuck I can do here. My dad has shared custody of me and since Monday i've had no contact with him. He is supposed to have a call with me every night but my mom claims he's been \"informed\" and supports this 100%. I tried calling him this morning but he didn't answer. He lives in another state so it's kinda hard to get into contact with him outside of phone and email. I'm at a friends house because I was able to leave the house for the first time in a week this morning after I told my parents I wanted to go to the park but came here and told my friend everything. Her parents are not home but she's trying to call them and I plan to stay here tonight if I can. My parents have forbid me from using the internet because it's \"full of lies from them\".\n\nI'm so lost right now it makes me sick. I do not want to go with them to this obvious compound and I need to know what the fuck I can do here. Can I just run away and if my parents harbor me can they get in trouble. If my mom has been lying about my dad can he do anything? thanks.\n\n**UPDATE(edited into the same post)**\n\nI talked to my mom and told her because I would be moving soon and this might be one of the last times I could see my friend I would like to stay the night and she said it was ok and that this family was \"trustworthy not to try and corrupt my view\". I got into contact with my dad and he's pissed. He did not agree and was told I didn't want to talk to him. My 15 year old sister's dad was told the same despite the fact he has primary custody and she only spends the summers with us. My sisters dad is going to call cps too and I just got done with my call to them but I wont repeat what they said here. I will be spending the night here and when my mom asks me to come back tomorrow my dad has told me not to go back and tell her that he will be flying down here to Florida immediately if I don't check in with him or he hears I went back to her. He says that he is already looking into emergency custody (I want to thank my friends parents real quick because holy fuck have they been great. They both have been great and are working with my dad right now to help me). I also will be going and buying a burner phone tomorrow and withdrawing all my money from the bank. My dad says he will handle getting my stuff from my mom when the time comes. Thanks guys for the advice.\n\n[update](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/csii9j/update_my_parents_joined_a_new_age_cult_and_tried/) \\- August 19th 2019\n\nSince my last post got popular and people still seem interested in my situation I thought I would give you guys a update on everything. It's been over a month and i'm sorry i kept you guys waiting. things were pretty crazy and my therapist said it probably wasn't the best idea to rant about it online till I felt ready. Well, now that i'm settled down a bit I feel like it might be good to get this off my chest anyway. Sorry if this disappoints you guys though as my dad says I should not include any personal details for fear of leaking my identity (so even though I know the group now I won't be naming them for fear of it getting back to me).\n\nSo after I stayed the night with my friends family my mom and step dad tried to get me to come back home immediately. My dad said not to go so I somehow convinced my mom to let me stay the rest of this day and I would come home that night. This plan didn't work out very well though as my sisters dad called the police to report that he couldn't contact my sister and was afraid she was kidnapped. It didn't take long before my mom caught on that I was the one who leaked to him their plans and they freaked out. My mom then came to my friends house and tried to force her way in to take me because I had been \"corrupted\" and needed to be locked away from bad influences till we left for the compound. My friends parents called the police and I called my dad and he got to talk to my mom. I'll leave it short and say this was a nightmare situation that almost ended with my mom being charged with trespassing.\n\nMy mom and dad argued on the phone for over 3 hours outside of my friends house. In the end my dad made it so I would not have to go with them but the only \"safe\" place my mom would agree to me staying is with my uncle 4 hours away. I stayed with him for over a week and it was the worst week of my life. My mom called me constantly to try to talk to me and \"save me from the evil energies my father had possessed me with.: My step father also began to send me various threats and told me that at the end of the month I was coming no matter what.\n\nAfter a week of this, everything changed. My mom stopped calling me, my stepdad stopped texting and they went quiet for 4 days. Me, my uncle, my dad, all of them couldn't reach them. My sisters dad also stopped being able to reach them. During this time my mom bought my sister a plane ticket home and my sisters dad only learned of this when he got a call after my parents dropped my sister off at the airport. After this my mom called me one last time.\n\nShe proceeded to tell me that she had been meditating, praying to my guardian spirits daily, and talking to the \"leaders\". All to to help me \"open my third eye to see the truth and understand I was being used by evil.\"During these sessions apparently she finally \"realized the truth\" and saw me for the \"evil spawn I was.\" According to her I am a \"evil seed\" and that I not only was brought here to bring evil spirits onto her and her \"good children\". I also infected the womb and corrupted my sister. She told me to send my uncle down and pick up all of my \"worldly possessions\" that were infected and to not come with him or ever contact her or her family again. She ended by telling me that I was never her child and that she hopes \"the universe deals with me\". The last contact I know about was her telling my dad she wants to revoke her parental rights.\n\nAt the end of last month they moved to the compound with my 3 step siblings. I moved out to live with my dad and have been in therapy since then. Things are still pretty raw right now and I really don't feel like getting into the emotions I feel towards this. But I feel like at least updating this may be a start. Thank you everyone who gave advice and sent me kind messages on here offering help. I really do appreciate it :)",

There is a LOT of prejudice in spiritual groups towards mental health meds.  It just makes me so mad.  And of course\u2026 these people make it hard for those of us who are more moderate and tempered to talk about our spirituality because I don\u2019t want to be labeled as crazy.  I try to maintain a balance between spirituality and physical reality.  But this type ruins it\u2026 how many times have I been asked if I\u2019m going to join a cult when I tell people I want to be part of a commune?  Way too many\u2026 like no, I just want to be around like minded, HEALTHY people.  It being a cult is a JOKE.  \n\nWow, that was a lot more than I intended to write.

Et d\u00e9sol\u00e9 si j'offense certains ou certaines parmi vous qui sont croyants, ce n'est vraiment pas mon but. Je veux juste exprimer mon opinion personnelle.  \n\r  \nPour moi, certaines religions sont des sectes normalis\u00e9es, moins dangereuses que l'arch\u00e9type de la secte, certes, mais quand m\u00eame. Par exemple, il m'est arriv\u00e9 plusieurs fois de me dire qu'il y avait une forme d'embrigadement \u00e0 rejoindre un culte \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu'il est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement impos\u00e9 d\u00e8s l'enfance (et ce de fa\u00e7on plus ou moins violente) : bapt\u00eame, circoncision, etc. Le fait d'enseigner aussi les croyances d\u00e8s l'enfance me pose question.   \nJe n'ai pas l'impression que l'on interroge la pertinence de ces pratiques comme on le ferait pour d'autres sujets touchant au d\u00e9veloppement de l'enfant et de son \u00e9ducation, alors qu'elles pourraient \u00eatre per\u00e7ues comme n\u00e9fastes pour beaucoup.  \nDans le contexte fran\u00e7ais, cet embrigadement s'est exerc\u00e9 aussi socialement jusqu'\u00e0 il n'y a pas si longtemps : je prends l'exemple de ma grand-m\u00e8re qui tenait un caf\u00e9, croyante, mais non pratiquante. Elle avait subi des pressions du cur\u00e9 (qui restait un peu le responsable politique du coin malgr\u00e9 la loi de s\u00e9paration de l'\u00e9glise et de l'\u00e9tat ; et avait beaucoup de pouvoir) car elle n'allait pas \u00e0 la messe. Ce dernier imposait alors aux fid\u00e8les de l'\u00e9glise de ne surtout pas se rendre au caf\u00e9 sous peine d'exclusion.  \n Je ne parle pas des mariages r\u00e9prim\u00e9s parfois tr\u00e8s fortement entre personnes ath\u00e9es/croyantes/de deux religions diff\u00e9rentes ; des nombreuses guerres et violences faites au nom d'un culte ; de l'entre-soi ; de la fermeture aux \u00e9volutions soci\u00e9tales et au discours scientifique, etc. , ni des rituels ou comportements induits dont certains me paraissent vraiment malsains ou au moins tr\u00e8s chelous si ce n'est d\u00e9viants ...  \n\r  \nJ'ai bien conscience que les choses ont beaucoup \u00e9volu\u00e9es, et que ce n'est pas forc\u00e9ment toujours aussi vrai ; et qu'une m\u00eame religion a diff\u00e9rentes fa\u00e7ons d'\u00eatre pratiqu\u00e9e, de nuances, tant \u00e0 travers le temps que le lieu o\u00f9 elle existe. Que n'importe qui a le droit et peut quitter la religion qu'on lui a inculqu\u00e9e dans son enfance aujourd'hui en France (m\u00eame si ce n\u2019est pas forc\u00e9ment le cas partout dans le Monde), etc. J'ai aussi conscience que les abus qui m'apparaissent sectaires fait au nom de la religion ne correspondent pas forc\u00e9ment \u00e0 la religion en elle-m\u00eame.  \n\r  \nIl n'emp\u00eache que pour moi, les m\u00e9canismes soci\u00e9taux de certaines religions sont/se sont apparent\u00e9s \u00e0 ceux de sectes ; mais leurs popularit\u00e9s sont telles et elles sont tellement anciennes que ces religions ont juste \u00e9t\u00e9 plus tol\u00e9r\u00e9es.\r  \nPar exemple, si une \"nouvelle\" religion prenait naissance aujourd'hui, en reprenant certains traits d'une religion d\u00e9j\u00e0 existante... Je ne suis pas vraiment certain qu'on l'accueillerait comme une religion, mais davantage comme une secte. Un exemple : un groupe de personne se met \u00e0 se r\u00e9unir r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement dans un b\u00e2timent assez singulier dans son apparence et ses symboles, y v\u00e9n\u00e8re une entit\u00e9 et un mythe surnaturels/farfelus, y am\u00e8ne leurs enfants avec eux et les fait passer par un rite initiatique : celui de se couper le petit orteil.  \nBon, \u00e7a serait bien \u00e9trange, non ? Je ne vois pas fonci\u00e8rement ce qui changerait de certaines communaut\u00e9s religieuses existantes pourtant.  \nEDIT : quelques fautes corrig\u00e9es.\r  \n",

Elle se caract\u00e9rise par la mise en \u0153uvre, par un groupe organis\u00e9 ou par un individu isol\u00e9, quelle que soit sa nature ou son activit\u00e9, de pressions ou de techniques ayant pour but de cr\u00e9er, de maintenir ou d\u2019exploiter chez une personne un \u00e9tat de suj\u00e9tion psychologique ou physique, la privant d\u2019une partie de son libre arbitre, avec des cons\u00e9quences dommageables pour cette personne, son entourage ou pour la soci\u00e9t\u00e9.\n\nJe ne pense pas qu'on puisse dire qu'une religion est simplement une secte qui est devenue socialement acceptable. \n\n>Par exemple, il m'est arriv\u00e9 plusieurs fois de me dire qu'il y avait une forme d'embrigadement \u00e0 rejoindre un culte \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu'il est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement impos\u00e9 d\u00e8s l'enfance (et ce de fa\u00e7on plus ou moins violente) : bapt\u00eame, circoncision, etc. Le fait d'enseigner aussi les croyances d\u00e8s l'enfance me pose question.\n\nLes parents inculquent aux enfants leurs notions ; il n'y a rien d'\u00e9trange \u00e0 cela, et je dirais m\u00eame que la tendance \u00e0 certains parents d'attendre que leurs enfants atteignent une certaine maturit\u00e9 avant de leur parler de leurs notions (que ce soit politique, religieux, philosophique ou j'en passe) ne fait que rendre ces enfants vuln\u00e9rables aux notions enseign\u00e9es par d'autres partis. La personnalit\u00e9, les int\u00e9r\u00eats, les id\u00e9aux... d'un enfant vont \u00eatre form\u00e9s par quelque chose dans tous les cas, que ce soit les parents ou pas.\n\nDe plus, ce qui distingue les religions des d\u00e9rives sectaires, c'est souvent le fait qu'une secte applique des m\u00e9thodes tr\u00e8s psychologiquement violentes pour emp\u00eacher les adeptes d'en sortir, y compris ceux qui sont n\u00e9s au sein de la secte. Un chr\u00e9tien catholique peut simplement d\u00e9cider de ne pas recevoir le sacrement de la confirmation une fois en \u00e2ge de choisir, et peut quitter la religion comme il le souhaite. Certes, l'enseignement du tournent \u00e9ternel si l'on devient un apostat, et la pression familiale si l'on quitte la religion dans laquelle nos parents nous ont \u00e9lev\u00e9s, apportent un certain poids psychologique, et donc certains en d\u00e9duisent que le christianisme est une secte. Mais la doctrine de l'enfer est une question seulement de croyance - si on n'y crois pas, \u00e7a ne change rien ici et maintenant, on ne va pas spontan\u00e9ment br\u00fbler - et la pression familiale n'est pas quelque chose command\u00e9 par l'\u00e9glise catholique. Prenons en contraste les T\u00e9moins de J\u00e9hovah : la Watchtower Society interdit aux fid\u00e8les d'avoir des relations quelconques avec les apostats, m\u00eame s'il existe un lien de famille. Les cons\u00e9quences sociales et psychologiques sont compl\u00e8tement diff\u00e9rentes et beaucoup plus s\u00e9v\u00e8res en cons\u00e9quence. \n\n>Dans le contexte fran\u00e7ais, cet embrigadement s'est exerc\u00e9 aussi socialement jusqu'\u00e0 il n'y a pas si longtemps : je prends l'exemple de ma grand-m\u00e8re qui tenait un caf\u00e9, croyante, mais non pratiquante. Elle avait subi des pressions du cur\u00e9 (qui restait un peu le responsable politique du coin malgr\u00e9 la loi de s\u00e9paration de l'\u00e9glise et de l'\u00e9tat ; et avait beaucoup de pouvoir) car elle n'allait pas \u00e0 la messe. Ce dernier imposait alors aux fid\u00e8les de l'\u00e9glise de ne surtout pas se rendre au caf\u00e9 sous peine d'exclusion.\n\nDans un tel cas, ou c'est un membre du clerg\u00e9 qui enseigne une telle chose, alors en effet on se rapproche de la d\u00e9rive sectaire. Cependant, il y a une diff\u00e9rence entre un groupe religieux *local* qui se comporte comme une secte (dans ce cas, une secte qui tourne autour de l'opinion du pr\u00eatre) sans r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l'enseignement du groupe religieux global (le Vatican ne dit pas qu'un catholique ne peut pas supporter l'entreprise de quelqu'un qui n'est pas pratiquant !), Et un groupe religieux *global* dont l'enseignement est fondamentalement celui d'une secte (avec, de nouveau, l'exemple des T\u00e9moins de J\u00e9hovah).\n\n>Il n'emp\u00eache que pour moi, les m\u00e9canismes soci\u00e9taux de certaines religions sont/se sont apparent\u00e9s \u00e0 ceux de sectes ; mais leurs popularit\u00e9s sont telles et elles sont tellement anciennes que ces religions ont juste \u00e9t\u00e9 plus tol\u00e9r\u00e9es.\n\nLe fait que les T\u00e9moins de J\u00e9hovah sont consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme une secte en France tandis que les Saints des Derniers Jours (\"Mormons\") ne le sont pas sugg\u00e8re le contraire. On peut \u00eatre un nouveau groupe religieux, avec des enseignements \"cheloux\", et pourtant ne pas \u00eatre classifi\u00e9 comme secte. Cela devient une secte, l\u00e9galement, lorsque les adeptes ne peuvent pas quitter la religion sous peine de cons\u00e9quences graves (violence physique ou psychologique), doivent se retirer de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, doivent enfreindre la loi, et en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral souffrent d'abus psychologique ou physique afin d'\u00eatre model\u00e9 de force au sein de la religion.",
                "le pb de ton post c'est que c'est applicable hors religieux. tiens par exemple les mariages dont tu parles, ya des pressions qui peuvent exister \u00e0 cause de la diff\u00e9rence de religion, mais de mon exp\u00e9rience les plus grosses pressions c'est souvent des diff\u00e9rences culturelles, que ce soit la m\u00eame religion ou non.

En fait l'id\u00e9e c'est que l'\u00e9ducation c'est en partie une transmission de valeurs, et la religion est surtout un ensemble de valeurs. Donc normalement si tu transmets ta religion a ton gosse proprement, tu lui transmets tes valeurs. Et c'est un peu le principe de l'\u00e9ducation. Apr\u00e8s oui c'est vrai que dans les religions en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral t'es pouss\u00e9 \u00e0 avoir tes gosses de la m\u00eame religion que toi, mais je pense pas que ca changerait grand chose, je veux dire meme sans cette injonction tu essaiera globalement de transmettre les memes choses.\n\n \n\napr\u00e8s ouais l'exemple du cur\u00e9 et de ta grand m\u00e8re c'est assez glauque, mais ca c'est plus un probl\u00e8me de valeurs que de croyances je dirai, ce genre de comportements s'observent chez les religieux et non religieux , comme on observe des religieux et des non religieux qui n'ont pas ce comportement",

Cette diff\u00e9rence de degr\u00e9 se situe dans la nuisance (aka \"dervies\"). Lorsqu'une nuisance est r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e et structurelle / syst\u00e9mique, on parle plus de secte. \nPar exemple, dans la religion, l'embrigadement des enfants existe, mais \u00e0 des degr\u00e9s divers, et c'est trop d\u00e9pendant d'une famille \u00e0 l'autre, ce n'est pas syst\u00e9mique \u00e0 la religion et aux fid\u00e8les.

Even moreso once you apply that same logic to other body parts. \n\nAn example would be amputating the tongue to eliminate halitosis and reduce your chances of getting oral cancer.

I am talking about the wisdom teeth and the appendix. But when it comes to the foreskin, doctors are so insistent that we get it cut off so quickly even when the baby has no foreskin related issues at all. \n\nIf religion didn't exist, neither would circumcision.

There is evidence of african tribes doing it prior to that as well. Certainly not an origin of abrahamic religions, that is for sure. Some Egyptians did it as a sign that one could endure pain. (IE-manliness/masculinity), also evidence that the Egyptians thought it was more clean. Many cultures did it differently as well, some having total removal, some having partial, some simply slitting the foreskin and leaving it, etc. It certainly wasn't based on anything beneficial though, really.",

                "Modern circumcision as inflicted upon almost all American men actually does have its origins in medicine rather than religion, but it was 19th century medicine and not reliably evidence-based. There were multiple reasons for it.\n\nIn the 1850s, an English physician conducted a study based on a sense that the Jewish community of London had lower incidence of STDs than gentiles, and hypothesized that their practice of circumcision was the reason. He then conducted a study (now found to be extremely flawed in its analysis) that seemed to confirm the hypothesis. He then campaigned in favor of universal prophylactic circumcision until the end of the century.\n\nSo while religion was the inspiration for the idea of circumcision, the reason for it in the modern era outside of Judaism and Islam was \"scientific\". It was to reduce the risk of STDs, not because Abraham or Moses said to do it.\n\nAnd then things got a little crazy. At least with STDs, which you catch by sticking your dick in things, it's not too far out of line to imagine that you might be able to avoid them by doing something to the dick. But it went well beyond that. By the 1890s doctors were ascribing cures for all kinds of conditions to circumcision that could not be more clearly unrelated, including paralysis, epilepsy, kidney stones, asthma, melanoma, etc. etc. etc. The procedure was therefore becoming more and more common.\n\nAlso, at the time, male masturbation was officially believed (wrongly, of course) to be very unhealthy and to result in all manner of mental and physical weaknesses and degeneracies. On observing that little boys were often fascinated by their foreskins, some doctors came to believe that if you just cut them off boys would stop playing with themselves. (Needless to say, it didn't work.)\n\nSo there were all these \"benefits\" to circumcision, and doctors promoted the hell out of it.\n\nEven so, the procedure didn't become near-universal until childbirth moved from the home under supervision of midwives to the hospital under supervision of doctors. Then it became fashionable, as such things do, because it became a marker of wealth: If you were circumcised, it was because you were wealthy enough to be able to afford a hospital birth. Then doctors simply began doing them routinely without formal consent. Instead, parents had to specifically and on their own initiative ask for it NOT to be done. So with nearly everyone was born in a hospital, nearly every boy found himself circumcised whether or not anyone asked for it.\n\nFortunately that's no longer the case, or at least it wasn't the case when my sons were born in the 1990s. The doctor actually asked first, and then did as he was told when we answered no. So neither of them have mutilated genitals.",

Also try Christian, Muslim and specially bhudhist literature too.  It's always good to keep an open mind. Our Hindu literature is fragmented and opposing in nature. There are few expect of our religion I won't be able to explain in a debate to any person.And re read all these after every ten years atleast. It's not about being atheist. It's about being logical and question everything. My journey started reading about Swami Dayanand in our DAV school. From there now I am well versed in hindu, muslim, Christian and Buddhist and Many western religious literature. Do read about Roman and Greek gods. The thor and Loki we see in Marvel movie are actually mythological gods. There is a tribe in Pacific which worships paratroopers they firs saw in World wars. Just think of from universal point,what gods will aliens be worshipping. It becomes very fuzzy.  If hindu gods are universal they created muslim and Christian and so the Iceland PPL. . it's human who created gods . And thus used the concept for wrong measures . Just look at sai baba. Once a guy who would beg PPL for oil,sell it and care for poor. Now we put his statue and worship him as god. I dare you to go and beg oil ,sell it and help poor. But it would be easier to just go to Sai baba mandir and worship him , right. King rama might be a great king . A noble man to be  followed.but no PPL created him to be a god. Now how can I a mortal do what a god rama did ?. How I can be maryada purshottam like him . He was god . Iam human. Remember all religious books are written by men not gods . So they have flaws or men.so please read hindu , bhudhist and even muslim literature. Christian, jews, Roman Greek gods. It never hurts to read. You cannot disagree from a book u haven't read. Like u cannot prove a theorem is wrong if u don't know what it is. So read ,raed a lot. And apart from religion read philosophy too. Nobody is wrong. No body is right. And review all again after every few years as u get more experience in life. Never be aftraid to change your views. It doesn't mean you are wrong. It mean u understand more. U might finally get what u looking for . Be open . Always listen to ur opposition.Be happy. We all will die in end. Thank you",

In order to be against something u gotta fully understand it...\n\nBut the understanding I have of religion based on discussions with friends and family, online discussions, and even random cab drivers is as follows...\n\nNature and the universe is the one true thing, and religion is supposed to be just an interpretation of nature. PPL say religion is anti-science cause \"science\" is a compilation of observed studies whereas most religions are based on philosophical interpretations of natural occurrences. That doesn't mean both can't have an intersection tho, it just shows why ppl supporting a religion and the \"science side\" PPL have some misunderstandings.\n\nThe strength of a religion comes from the fact that the core interpretation of reality by the religion is strong, close to actual reality and relatability..this is where pantheism comes into picture... Although there might be some differences of opinion between Hinduism and pantheism itself... My opinion is that God should be interpreted like that - an omnipresent entity which does not give us nature and other important elements, but rather IS nature itself. Like for example the main god wrt pantheistic beliefs is the Sun since it provides all of the energy the earth needs.\n\nDifferences of opinions exist everywhere, even between two hindu philosophies there might be some minor misunderstanding. But the thing is we must recognise ourselves as being who can make a balance out of this universe only by being together...

Which youtube video did you watch and get motivated you dumb cunt\r  \n\r  \nMy argument is that if you believe that there are no bhagwans or NO God (if u r Abrahamic) or no higher power (like Karma) that provides some form of \"cosmic justice\", then literally every action you do is fucking meaningless. There would be no point in following \"right\" and not doing any \"wrong\". From a purely hedonistic perspective, which is what would be the result of questioned atheism (as MY pleasure is the priority given the fact that I can only experience from MY body and that even if someone else is getting hurt/feeling pain, I don't feel it or there will be no consequences if I have inflicted that pain), doing what is \"wrong\" is OK if it maximizes our pleasure- if we can get away with it.\r  \n\r  \nAll laws and some bullshit notions of right and wrong made by humans will make NO sense to be followed cause most of them actually decrease my individual pleasure. For example, if I exact pleasure by becoming a serial womanizer, I should do it then. Cause fuck the fact that it hurts people. It gives ME pleasure and because presuming that I don't believe in any higher power, there will be 0 consequences and I can pretty easily get away with it.\r  \n\r  \nLastly, if my answer appears condescending, it was meant to. Get off your high horse and come to the earth you flying dick\r  \n\r  \n`Be atheist and believe in common sense.

That guy was much more sensible. Same thread.\n\n`You think that People need God to set their morality as if we're fucking machines running on orders from above`\r  \n\r  \nUhhh no? I believe that humans have free will and are not \"machines running on orders from above\". I'm just arguing that without bhagwan or something like karma to carry out cosmic justice, any bad action you do (presumably because it gives you pleasure) may not be punished, so it may not make sense from a hedonist perspective to do what is right and avoid what is wrong.\r  \n\r  \n`Evil people will be evil and good people will be good regardless of Religion.`\r  \n\r  \nAs a Hindu, I agree. Karm (action) decides good people and evil people. I don't believe that being 'Hindu' or any other religion on paper makes you inherently good or bad.\r  \n\r  \n`by this logic, every atheist should be running around murdering and raping everyone`\r  \n\r  \nNo. 1) Most atheists are internet trolls who haven't questioned reality with no or as little bias as possible. Most of them have adopted the ideology because it sounds \"cool\" or because some fucking YouTube video 'moved' them. They haven't examined the interplay between atheism and hedonism 2) The Rule of Law is prevalent so you can't go around murdering and raping people without consequences... we don't live in anarchy. 3) Quite some atheists deep down believe in bhagwan or a higher power like Karma. I've seen this firsthand.\r  \n\r  \n`while every religious follower is pious and commits no crime but is that how people work?`\r  \n\r  \nYou see most \"religious followers\" who rape people and/or commit crimes usually do so for two reasons\r  \n\r  \nThey think that committing that crime is doing the right thing. Hint: Just look at the peacefuls.\r  \n\r  \nThey are not actually religious, but are pretending to be\r  \n\r  \nThere is the (I hope we agree on this) rare case when a truly religious person commits a crime knowing that he's doing something wrong. But the fact that he/she believes bhagwan exists and karma exists means that believes that he/she will get the results of their bad action. So, usually, truly religious/pious people will do less morally questionable things than rootless hedonists or rootless atheists.\r  \n\r  \n`I am an agnostic myself, I don't commit crimes and shit not because of fear of god`\r  \n\r  \nPersonally, I think this \"fear God\" thing is very Western. That is not how we Hindus view Bhagwan. Or at least, it's not how I view Bhagwan. I agree it's not healthy to \"fear\" God.\r  \n\r  \n`but because I don't wanna disappoint the people who trust me.`\r  \n\r  \nExactly. This is my point. Hedonism isn't just the pursuit of sexual pleasure. It's pleasure in general. You don't want to disappoint the people who trust you because you think that maintaining their trust gives you the most pleasure. So you are acting Hedonistically (nothing wrong with that in this case ofc).\r  \n\r  \nPlease let me know if you disagree somewhere.",

It is a matter of belief, and a different way of seeing things than some others. Those who believe, do, and those who don't, won't. But congrats on your discoveries so far.",

This applies for all religions, not just hinduism. The masses get hung up on the 90% and defend that without getting the crux of the religion. Atheists see that there is a lot of bullshit, but throw away the real and good part of religion along with the 90%. So yes, both religious and atheistic people are neither right nor wrong.

                "The reasons that you've stated for becoming a believer again are rather flimsy. You think the universe is made up of 'energies' and that these are represented as humans to make people understand better? Are people really lacking that much in intellect that basic scientific concepts need to be warped into fairy tales to make them understand. I don't think so.\nNowadays, a lot of pseudoscientific terms like energies, vibrations, and auras are mentioned by 'modern' religious people, to make it sound like their religion is strongly associated with and has preceded science in discoveries. However, these statements have no basis. Even our current Prime Minister Narendra Modi believes that there were aircrafts in the past built by the vedic civilization because of the mentions of a 'Pushpak Viman'. If it did exist, why don't we find any relics of it and any description of the actual physics behind its operation in Hindu scriptures? You mentioned that there's a lot of information in those texts - can you give me a single example of a piece of text that describes some information that, in no ambiguous terms, can provably be useful to modern science? In all likelihood, you won't.\nAlso, you stated that Sri Rama's purpose was to instill moral values and set an example. However, there are still some morally ambiguous characteristics he has, which shows that moral absolutes (such as leaving his wife after her trial through fire) are non-existent. Morals change and evolve according to society's requirements over time. Morals are simply a device needed to maintain law and order in society. A uniform set of rules and guidelines has been proven to be very useful for peaceful co-existence in humans. That's where morality comes from, and a lot of people don't realize this.\n\nReligion can be useful in setting precedents and moral guidelines, but it is not based on historical events that should be taken seriously, because when it is taken seriously, you get the shitstorm that is communal violence, religious extremism, and opportunism from predatory politicians, businessmen, and cultists.",

                "You need to read more dear friend.\nI was one of those who defended hinduism against atheism and had a similar rationalisation of mythology to justify them and ground them in objective reality. It took time to free myself of that.\nStill I adore the Upanishads and recommend everyone to read them.\n\nIndia had a great culture of debate, discussion, philosophy and to an extent scientific inquiry that developed over millennium. Every aspect of human existence was being debated and discussed. There was tremendous progress made in the debates between the astik and the nastik schools of Indian darshan. Atheism or materialism is not a new idea, the Carvaka school is one of the oldest schools of materialism completely indegenous to India.\n\nWhat we today call as Hinduism is just a umbrella term for a vast amount of religious practices, philosophies and regional identities grouped together, which all share commonalities.\nIn India itself, the Sankhya philosophical once rejected the idea of a personalized God, Then shankaracharya developed his Advaita in face of all the ritualistic and dualistic religions present in India. \n\nThe need of images, murtis, forms has been always debated, the serious thinkers had always seen them as tools for the masses for their spiritual upliftment. \n\nThe Problems:\nThe ancient religions of India had become extremely ritualistic, had too far away from core philosophy and reduced themselves to just repetitive practices. The rational or a true agnostic-atheist critique is against these. When you see evidence contradicting any existing belief no matter written in any document or scripture you must reject that belief. The orthodoxy always rejects this, they hold on to thier beliefs no matter what. Then there is the question of false histories, The great mythological epics of India are an achievement of literary construction but they are not objective history. A lot of people are promoting them as objective histories of India. Big claims require proofs of same stature. The beauty of those epics is in the preservation of dharmik wisdom by encoding them in stories. Here in 21st century we debate if Vimana were real or not, or people had nuclear weapon or not. It is appaling in my view. Then there is the Caste system. I don't need to say anything there just read Manusmriti yourself. You will find it to be the most confused, irrational and contradictory text ever written.\n\n\nThe scientific inquiry perished in India long ago, you can blame different invasions, raids or caste system or the combination of all to make sense of that. If knowledge had been widely distributed it would have better chance of survival.  In my opinion Caste system prevented that.\n\nIts fine to use imagery and symbolism for spiritual practices but we have seen them becoming an ends in themselves. This is dangerous. It takes us away from truth. For e.g. it is okay to pray to deified ideas of natural phenomenon say mother Saraswati for being successful in quest of knowledge, it may give you focus and make you disciplined, however believing that it is because you pray you pass a test and not because you study is irrational. All human experience happens within you.\n\nSimply put popular religion as it is practiced popularly is based on blind faith, faith can be liberating but an excess becomes like chains holding us in darkness. The rationalists or atheist challenge that blind faith.",

Either the documents are really, literally true.  In that case where is the evidence? Or it's just a figurative representation of the actual way in which universe operates - in that case too, where is the evidence?\n\n>Rishis made their discoveries and related them to human-like figures \n\nThat's possible, but where is the evidence to show that their discoveries about the universe are true and correct?\n\n>Like people forgot the whole reason why we worship Shri Ram, to attain a beautiful nature like him and gain enlightenment.\n\nYou have committed the [Appeal to Consequences](https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/cgi-bin/uy/webpages.cgi?/logicalfallacies/Appeal-to-Consequences) logical fallacy here.  Just because you think Shri Ram's nature is beautiful, or that you think that you can attain enlightenment based on his nature, it doesn't in any way, shape or form prove that the documents that you refer to are factual or logical.\n\nThe disaster with all religions is that they are good at providing consolation for problems.  But they don't do anything systematically to actually solve problems.  It puts people to sleep and makes them temporarily forget their problems.  It's like a bunch of low-pay laborers drinking alcohol in the evening after work to forget their travails.

            "selftext": "My husband has always been religious having grown up that way. We have been together for 10 years, married 6. We have two beautiful kids. For the first 5 years, we had an amazing sex life. Since having kids, it slowed but we would try to have sex once a month or so and it was always good. \n\nWe have usually gone to church on Sundays (especially since having kids). I\u2019m not overly religious but I don\u2019t mind church.\n\nIn the last 6 months, he has really embraced his religion (catholic). He reads dozens of books on Catholicism, listens to podcasts, prays many times a day, says the full rosary multiple times a day, has bought various different rosaries and religious art and statues and jewelry.\n\nWe always used condoms, but he now refuses on religious grounds. I am so done having kids but me offering to go on the pill has been met with \u2018that\u2019s wrong too\u2019. I am completely uninterested in unprotected sex. It was easy for us to get pregnant and I\u2019m positive the \u201cpull out method\u201d will be a terrible idea. I told him I\u2019m not having more children. Wouldn\u2019t it be better for me to be on birth control rather than contemplate abortion?! He of course doesn\u2019t want that but it\u2019s not enough to change his mind.\n\nHe won\u2019t even touch me anymore because foreplay etc is sexual and if it \u201cdoesn\u2019t lead to natural sex\u201d it\u2019s against the church teachings. honestly, I resent his devoutness. We haven\u2019t had sex in 5 months. He is basically telling me we will again when I\u2019m no longer fertile (that could be 10-15 years away\u2026). I\u2019m at a loss. I can have honest conversations with him but they always circle into him trying to explain this is what the church teaches, the end. \n\nI\u2019ve even told him the lack of intimacy is making me fantasize about other people. It doesn\u2019t sway him. In the late hours I contemplate seeking  sexual attention elsewhere.\n\nI don\u2019t know where else to vent about this, or if I\u2019m even looking for advice, I just needed to put it out there. My friends listen but definitely don\u2019t get it, as none of them are catholic.\n\nEDIT: thank you so much for all the responses! There are so many pieces of practical and thoughtful advice. We\u2019re going to meet with the priest, and after a good heart to heart he agrees me being on BC is a \u2018me\u2019 choice that doesn\u2019t interfere with \u2018his\u2019 beliefs. He is on board to meet in the middle. Thank you all.",

Lying by omission to your spouse is probably not the healthiest thing for a marriage, but I understand how it might work in this situation. You could even pretend like you're doing Natural Family Planning (which would please him) while also using a birth control method without him knowing. But dlsclaimer again - lying is bad for marriages.\n\nUsing birth control is seen as a sin if you're Catholic, however I think plenty of Catholic women do it anyway... If you aren't Catholic then that part won't matter to you. But regardless, it's your choice, and the sin wouldn't be your husband's. He wouldn't be sinning by having sex with you.",

It's also imperative that you tell him that you don't want any more children, which may create even more division.

(i know this case is extreme and it sounds like there would be an exception, but i promise there isn\u2019t.)\n\nyes, people here are right in saying that most catholics DO use birth control. that\u2019s like saying some muslims eat pork, some southern baptists have an occasional beer, or some jews put up a christmas tree, though. *most people follow their faith unfaithfully.* just because it happens doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s permissible in the eyes of the church, and considering your husband is devout, it\u2019s the opinion of the church that matters most here. \n\nis that unfortunate? in my opinion, as an ex-catholic who hates the church, yes. i think you\u2019re in a horrible situation, and i think the rules of the church are oppressive and archaic. they\u2019re designed to keep women pregnant and unable to leave a relationship. i also can acknowledge that you husband is doing things as he believes them to be correct. \n\nif you\u2019re interested in any advice, i would recommend either an iud or sterilization surgery for yourself depending on your health and your comfort with disclosing your choice to your husband. \n\nyou can get an iud without his knowledge and have sex with him as if you aren\u2019t on birth control. this, to me, feels like it enters a gray area of consent, but there is no impact that will be had on his body at the end of the day. with the iud, you may be in pain for a week or two depending on your reaction to the insertion, but you could lie to him about the cause. you could have the doctor clip the string short so he doesn\u2019t feel it during penetration (this might be more difficult if he\u2019s lengthy). pain during sex, if you experience it when you resume having sex, could be chalked up to having sex for the first time in a while. if you have any questions about the iud, i\u2019m more than happy to chat here or in dms because i have one myself. \n\nwith sterilization surgery, i would imagine a tubal ligation or a bilateral salpingectomy would be the least damaging to your natural hormone levels and involve the least recovery time, but i also imagine you would struggle to hide this from him. at the end of the day, considering his devoutness, i don\u2019t anticipate him trying to physically stop you from getting this procedure or refusing to have sex once you have it done (because it\u2019s not made to be reversed and it doesn\u2019t require maintenance like an implant or a pill). i expect he would beg and try to intellectually wear you down beforehand, though. ultimately, you could still consult your doctor to get a better idea of your options and to see if his knowledge would be necessary. \n\n*you have the final say about your body.* you can make adjustments to it without his permission.",

We together would would talk, play and have whale of a time. We'd together watch \"Discovery\" and \"Nat geo\", curiously talk space and science. He definitely was smart, had good grades and had a bright future ahead.\n\nHis parents, who're uneducated, are devout followers of a International Hindu sect(cult rather). They pushed him into it from high school. He started visiting their temples, attending *pravachans* of *swamis*. His beliefs turned orthodox, He started talking outlandish claims about how great *Hinduism* is and how *Modi* is a messiah for us. He now himself gives short *pravachans* at temples, and uploads them to his YouTube channel. I skimmed through his channel, only to find him speaking like a typical Whatsapp Uncle, talking \"Indian culture is being destroyed by West\". He could have become an English-Speaking, well educated engineer or researcher in the US. He has now lost track of his career, pursuing B. Pharma from some random Tier-3 college .\n\nThroughout our convo, he mentioned \"Hinduism is in jeopardy\", we need to protect it. He's totally orthodox and brainwashed with not even an iota of modernity and critical thinking left. I feel extreme pity for him, and equally infuriated towards the cult who ruined his life, squashed his potential and half-wit parents who pushed him into religion at such a tender age.\n\nMind you, I'm myself a believer of *Vedanta*, quite influenced by Hinduism and not against it.",

AlKhwarzmi (algorithm comes from his name, and others) (Some of which were direct students of some of the people that we consider holy.)\nI used to wonder what went wrong. Why is Muslim population in general doing so bad. \nAnd believe me I was not wondering about war torn places. That is understandable. If the country is under attack there ain't stability the people will obviously be focusing on survival and food and not science. But there are places where we could have been doing better. But sadly no, we were not. In the places where Muslims had the opportunities to prosper and grow they would turn inwards into religion, break up into sects and just dive so deep into proving all other sects wrong. \nBut I always wondered what lead to this. If you are doing good, why would a whole population turn to this instead of improving and in general getting better.\nHinduism has been improving a lot. Like real lot. They had abolished sati pratha, and a thousand other things that were bad and I couldn't understand why not us? I mean yes, majorly it was the people in power who would initiate the change, and the gov did too in the independent India. That did explain how positive change can come. It's difficult, needs atleast not-reflection and finally admitting that the change is better. But why would people go downhill? \nAnd then came late 2010s. It answered how people can happily agree to letting their next generations downfall especially when they are doing well but get a false sense of danger and enemity. \nAfter reading about how Hitler turned a whole population against another population I understood why somebody would want to do it and how easy it is to manipulate people with fear. You make people believe that the other group will harm you if you don't harm them first. (It's a self fulfilling prophecy). Ohhh i think I am getting off topic. Anyway, it is what it is. \nSadly this has been happening everywhere ever since. \nPeople change, characters change. \"Victims\" and \"oppressors\" switch places. But the same thing repeats over and over. \nA population misled by some people will slowly see it's downfall but sooner or later it will realise it and come back and improve (most probably).

Anyways I just went to funeral and saw lots of family I hadn't seen since 2019, the whole service was super religious. Everyone was talking about gods plan (to give my cousin who was in her 50s cancer and die a slow painful death?). My cousin was not religious at all, the last words she heard were her brother in law telling her God was ready to receive her, she died right then. He took that as a sign that she was saved in her last breath. \n\nI'm so sad. The service being very religious. Him telling that story as if to say he won in the end. And then just seeing in real life that that whole side of the family are so into religion, I'm sure the distance in recent years is not just because of covid. \n\nMy sisters and mom and I had a talk, we promised not to let anyone try to convert us on our deathbeds, only interesting/funny stories and good music will be allowed when I'm dying.",

I was allowed at family events, but she really didn\u2019t talk to me ever again.  She passed when I was 16.  It was sudden and left no chance of reconciliation.  \n\nOtherwise, I have a few MAGA Catholic relatives, but we don\u2019t discuss religion or politics and can get along fine for a couple hours when we need to.  \n\nThe few other relatives I have had to cut off have been for completely non religious reasons.",

My wife and I are going through IVF (in vetro fertilization) and she told me it's un natural and that the other fertilized eggs have souls so not using them for babies is abortion. If we would just trust god he'd open up her womb. All that bullshit. My other sister probably believes the same things but doesn't want cut off. And my mom thinks the rapture is going to happen every 6 weeks. They're all nuts",

But I never really liked that uncle anyway, so I don't know if that counts.  \n\nThe others are religious,  but pretty easy to get along with.  They say some religious stuff,  I say \"I don't believe that,\" they drop it, and we carry on as though it never came up. \n\nI *have* lost a few to Trumpism, though.",

The couldn't go a few hours without bringing up politics and religion (when many were never religious to begin with). We put up a pride flag one year, and everyone acted like we were diseased or mental. \n\nMy dad and brother are pastors. They've never officially asked, but I think they know I've lost my religion.

It\u2019s not a personal choice, but rather an official mandate. Now with the new video department, they put out very emotionally provocative dramatizations about how firmly one must completely shun relatives who no longer believe. We\u2019re talking, if they call on the phone you must refuse to answer. Maybe they are bleeding to death in a ditch after a car accident, but it doesn\u2019t matter. Almost every meeting or convention the retirement to cut off people who have left is emphasized and it is portrayed as a matter of loyalty to God to obey this mandate.",

So we grew up without religion.\n\nWhen my brother and I both told her at young ages we definitely didn't believe in any religion as it was all definitely nonsense. She didn't mind.\n\nI wish my mum didn't believe.  I can't fully trust adults who believe such obvious lies.",

Yes, everyone that's left should learn something from the passing of a cherished individual and try to grow out of it. We shouldn't linger and live on. \n\nOther than that, their god has no plan.

He fell in love with a southern baptist preacher's daughter, and they wouldn't accept him unless he was also way into Jesus. So he went through the indoctrination process voluntarily, even went to a Christian college and teaches at a Christian school now. He also moved away and rarely talks to any of us. He might think I'm still a deist, but I doubt that his wife sees much distinction.",

                "A relative was on some holier than thou spiel after becoming a born-again catholic, typical hypocrisy from a religious nut full of his own self-importance.\n\nSo I quoted that bible verse about the descendants of an illegitimate birth being cursed to the 10th generation.\n\nSince his grandmother was raped by a catholic priest when she was a young teen and his own mother was the product of that rape, that shut him up.    \n\nI don't speak to the majority of my family from Nothern Ireland even though I have relatives on both sides of the religious divide.  Too much evangelisation, wild takes, assumptions and violent reactions regarding religion.  My agnostic dad had already burned bridges with them years ago and each time there was an attempt at reconciliation, something like that inevitably happened.  Since my dad died, I've seen no reason to remind them I exist.",
                "My dad is a minister.  I've never been 100% clear and honest with my disbelief but I don't participate in anything church/faith related activities (including praying at the table with them) so my parents have to be incredibly dense not to realize it.  \n\nA few years ago my dad cornered me about trying to get my kid baptized.  He got upset when I said that will be up to my kid to make that decision when he's capable of making that sort of choice.  He effectively said, \"See, I have a problem with that.  How is he going to know what he believes or where he came from if he's not raised with a church??\"\n\nIt was oddly satisfying to see my dad basically confess to indoctrinating kids into the church.  But, it also was sad to realize that i will never have a completely honest relationship with my dad because if I was explicit about it we'd just be separated permanently, which isn't my desire. \n\nFor now, we just have a surface level relationship.  No deep conversations on life as a dad, husband to my wife, etc.  It's a real shame to realize that my dad thinks in ways and treats his kids in ways that i would NEVER think of doing with my own kids. \n\nAs far as my extended family? They're all MAGA idiots that probably think I'm some sort of urban devil worshipping communist that wants to eat babies.  They would have the commie part correct, at least.  I am more than happy to not associate with them.  My mother is just clueless about everything. My brother is also an atheist, so I have some familial comraderie there.\n\nEither way, the thread that runs through everything is obviously the fact that religion has put a poison pill into the relationships of my family.

I had to explain, explain again and over explain why I could not go. This company had a lot of older workers too so it was especially awkward with them. This was before the era of \"political correctness\" in the workplace so it wasn't uncommon to hear a lot of talk that no one would get away with today.

I was a delivery driver, ansd also had other restaurant duties. I had me a very fantastic time. It took about 3-4 months for most everyone to discover I was a J.W., soon to be an EX. I got along so well w/most everyone, but according to J.W.'s, that;s not suppose to happen. You're supposed to be different. The real big difference was when I read the company policies on grooming and behavior of the workers. No vulgar leanguage permitted. No obsene jesting, no bullying, no texting of any kind, etc. I thought I was reading out of the Bible. The boss himself was a church goer, ans well as his family. I got along great w/practically everyone.  Another older co-worker, whjo was /isd w/the Assemblies of God, asked me what my favorite scriptures weere. Of all things. I was never meant to be cornered, if you will. We all treated one another like family. Believe it or not, alot of the staff thought that vulgar language and off color jokes were completely unnecessary.  It just told me, who really are the real Christians? Not the J.W.s. No way. You know, the funny thing of it is, the boss made sure everyone had mutual respect for everyone. No bad or indecent conduct tolerated. If after the 2nd offense took place, you were fired. I so looked forward to going to work at Pappy's Pezzeria. I'd worked around J.W.'s in the construction trades, way back in the day, and always was so disappointed w/the obsene jesting and bad or off color humor or language.

We are tired. One person called my comment an \u201cemotional response\u201d which is actually so fucking insensitive. Like what if I said that to a person complaining about persecution of Muslims? I would probably be downvoted to the point where I lose all my karma. But no, since I\u2019m talking about MENA Christians, talking about our issues is \u201ctaboo\u201d.\n\nEarlier today, a Muslim sent me a DM telling me to burn in Hell. The reason: someone asked me my opinion on Muhammad and I said I believe he is a false prophet, a terrible man, who taught lies.\n\nAs a Christian, this is *obviously* going to be my belief. This doesn\u2019t mean I hate Muslims. A lot of you guys not only disagree, but actively hate on our beliefs such as the Trinity. All I did was answer a question and this disrespectful, unloving person decides to tell me to burn in hell.\n\nAnd for some reason, Muslims have made it taboo to talk about how we Christians are treated under Muslim rule. Like I\u2019ve heard of churches getting destroyed, Christians getting kidnapped and absolutely disgusting atrocities committed against them by some Muslim extremist. These are facts that should not be ignored. Historically, Christians were forced to convert to Islam under many Muslim empires. Sure, some rulers were better than others, but the one constant in every Muslim empire is that we were seen as second class citizens.\n\nAnd to the person who called this an emotional response, u/boshnjak , tell that to the Christians who lost their family members because the FSA or any other group decided to kill a couple of \u201ckafirs\u201d.\n\nFreedom for MENA Christians \u271d\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f",

It seems biably wierd as a whole that as a cleric of say a prime God( most settings have a list of prime gods) it seems weird that you would have little to no inkling on how the rites of other main deities. Given that most good or lawful gods are going to have some level of overlap in how they are worshiped because thg hey aref the same pantheon, and often have overlapping ideals and worshipers. \n\nAn example if you if worship Silvanus God of the Wilds and Nature. There would certainly be a bit of overlap with understand the elemental chaos and its effects on the world because it CAUSES some severe wild nature or even spots that USED to have breaches you know who else they would know a lot about Mielikki, goddess of forests. Silvanus's daughter. And a the patron of rangers and most Druids. Her domains over lap with her fathers frequently and often sent the wild animals as envoy. The prime difference is that he oversaw the course of the natural cycle of life as a prime tenant one he doesn't share with his daughter but does share with eldath and shaillia. Who often view him as father aswell and have crafted spells like *banish light* for him. \n\nThe problem is that these are each gods in their own right and have their own worshipers attached to them but given the familial relationship of these goddesses and him being father and daughter it makes little sense from my POV that a worshiper of Slivanus wouldn't have a lot of information of about the other three deities that help oversee forest nature as well. But that would be generally represented by a religion check because it's not the deity you worship. Or should it be? Given the relationship between those gods. it becomes a problem of how much should or do you know before it becomes a roll for that information. And if it does become a roll should you gain a bonus to it on the information you had learned or not.

I'm here like... look, if you want to know what exact plant that is and it possible uses--say, like might be listed in a BOOK YOU READ--then no that's int. You really want to use wis (nature)? Fine, I can justify that telling you whether its safe to ingest or not but that's pretty much it.\n\nSame for religion. You want to use Wisdom? Ok, that might get you some piece of advice or scripture from your faith that relates to what your asking, but it might be biased and not all that helpful. If you want to know some piece of religious lore, especially not pertaining to your own faith, then that is intelligence.",

                "Totally agree for religion. Religious people normally only know about their religion due to bias, so someone proficient in religions would need to impartially study all. With Nature, someone who turns into animals and lives in the wilderness would probably be pretty capable in that aspect. A scientist could tell you the official name, but a druid can tell you how it actually feels to be that animal, so it's a little less straight forward imo. I think Survival covers the skills most people expect when they think nature though, and not a scientific understanding like the Int. Mod of Nature would imply.",

That's not just strength mate, the technique and knowledge of trigonometry/physics is what's going to allow you to jump in the most efficient way to the most efficient point possible.\n\nPersuasion. Obviously your knowledge around the subject you're talking about is the most important thing. Trying to bribe a guard? Well int lets you know the standard price, how often it usually works and whether this guard is known for being corrupt. \n\nAttack rolls? Yeah man, how does just being dextrous or strong help you hit the critical weak points in the enemies defence? Obviously this should be int based as your knowledge of various types of armours, creatures, weapons, battle tactics, techniques etc is what really allows you to strike for weak areas or make sure you're doing the most damage possible.\n\nSurely the fact that in real life int effects everything means that in DnD every check in the game should be int based.\n\n/s for the OP who might actually agree with this.",

But I could totally see, with the right context, Wisdom  (Nature) or Wisdom (Religion) being called into play.\n\nI can also see Constitution  (Athletics) for endurance tasks. \n\nIn the case of Nature and Religion, the informations given to the PC should be appropriate to the check made to avoid invalidating Intelligence as a stat even more.\n\nNonetheless, if you feel like a character should have better chances to roll decently than a +1, and the context makes sense, please do remember this Variant rule that nobody ever uses.\n\nAlso, this is strictly out of combat obviously.",
                "Exactly Intelligence in 5e is very much \u201crecall of information\u201d with an exception of Investigation which still somewhat leans on recall of information to find something that looks out of place.",

                "I enjoy playing rangers and druids as I love nature (and as I own a forest, I have a fair share of knowledge regarding nature), but I absolutely hate it when my character wants to identify some animal tracks or cries, plants or mushrooms and the DM asks me to roll an Intelligence (Nature) check. \n\nThe wilderness is the druid's and ranger's home, they are the ones who  should know what is going on there more than anyone else. Just like how a bard's niche is social skills, a rogue's niche is doing stuff undetected and a wizard's niche is Arcana and scientific knowledge, the druid's and ranger's niche is the wilderness. They either should be able to identify tracks, animal cries or plants without a roll or roll Wisdom (Survival), a skill in which they are actually good.         \nThey won't know scientific names or exact taxonomy, but they will certainly know common names like brown bear, maple tree or champignon and important facts they might have learned from their own experience or from their mentor (examples: the bear can climb and swim, therefore neither trees nor water provide safety; in an area with maple trees certain other useful plants are likely to be found; the champignon is edible but you need to check certain features to ensure that it is not the similar-looking death cap...).\n\nIn some cases, Wisdom (Nature) makes sense too, depending on what the character wants to know. \n\nWhat's even worse with Nature is that dumping Intelligence for rangers and druids often makes sense from a flavor/thematic perspective, because a forest dweller is not getting any education beyond what their mentor and other tribesmembers tell them. Books likely don't exist there at all and might even be frowned upon (\"tree corpses\") or are very rare. Meanwhile, the five other attributes all make sense to be decent at for someone who spent their whole life in the wilderness, the physical ones in particular.\n\nAs a DM I ask rangers and druids for Intelligence (Nature) checks only for truly scientific knowledge and facts, but for anything else, I ask for a Wisdom (Survival) check or give the information without a roll. Sometimes, as kind of a middle ground, I ask for Wisdom (Nature) rolls.      \nI also like to use Wisdom (Arcana) for checks related to druidic magic and rituals.",

Like I don't see how your academic understanding of religion would assist in your ability to withstand the pain of walking on coals. \n\nUnless the point is that you know the trick of doing it without pain? Where you do it slowly and put the full surface of your foot on the coal bed. So that you only touch the cooler surface coals rather than dig your feet into the hot lower coals.\n\nAt which point it wouldn't be a constitution check at all. It would be more like a dexterity check to maintain your balance or a wisdom check to avoid losing your nerve.",
                "Honestly, I think the Nature skill should just be renamed to \"Science\". Then people would have a much more intuitive understanding of what it does.",
                "This doesn't really address the gripe that people have. A person who has dedicated their life to nature or gods should be pretty versed in the respective subject. The reason a Cleric or Druid has Wisdom over Intelligence is because the class requires it for their features.\n\nThis is just a failing of the stat system in general. Somebody who has practiced picking locks isn't necessarily good at picking pockets or acrobatic feats, yet in D&D they are because the game cares more about the stats than proficiencies."

I've been struggling with my mental health recently and have been having night terrors due to my PTSD from my ex husband and everyone has rallied around me and been amazing. They actually want to know what I'm struggling with and help me through it, I phoned a friend at 2am last night and they rushed over and sat with me. I never had friends like that as a JW. Sure, I knew a lot of people and grew up with people I considered friends, but they never wanted to know about my trauma or what I'd been through. Whenever I tried to talk about it, I was told to leave it between me and Jehovah. Actually got told by the elders not to talk about it with anyone so I didn't upset people or bring reproach on Jehovah's name. Biggest pile of bullshit, what they meant was sweep it under the rug so no one finds out how much they failed to keep someone safe in their organisation. It got so bad when I was bottling it up that I tried to take my own life 3 times. \nLong and short: friends in the 'world' are 100% more supportive, loyal and loving than anyone within the congregation",

Getting out into the world and meeting kind people (who surprise- aren\u2019t witnesses) has been one of the more comforting things that I think most people are left with when they leave. There is no pressure to preach to people, and I think most of us find out that when you aren\u2019t invading peoples personal space (showing up to their doors, sending them letters, trying to call them) trying to also indoctrinate the lies into them they\u2019re a lot more kind than the \u201cworldly\u201d people they get painted to be.

That being said- seeing the way the witnesses treat people after years of knowing them, and being raised as almost their family vs the kindness I received in the first 10 minutes of talking to a stranger is unmatched. I no longer feel after every meeting, every convention, every broadcast, every watchtower, every prayer that I am not enough, or not worthy of life. This additional realization put into perspective that as Jehovah\u2019s witnesses miss out on so much positivity, and kindness by labeling people to shun them publicly in group numbers. I\u2019m learning that life is about unity. It was never supposed to be about superiority. It makes me emotional thinking about how I hated on people the way I was also taught to growing up(the homophobia the sexist values the huge egos they all learned to grow during the process which caused them to usually treat people like projects to work on not human beings with souls. I\u2019ve grown so much just by leaving that awful organization. I\u2019m learning to love the unity in life. The unity that simply can coexist no matter what hope you have for after or before death.

                "I was born and raised in a very strict Catholic household, and as I\u2019ve entered adulthood have really had to work through the same issues you described. \n\nI agree faith, especially when institutionalized, is pridefully misused for power, control, etc., in our world. It is hard to not get a sour taste in my mouth about faith because of this. \n\nSomething I have learned through an ongoing self-exploration process and what faith means to me is realizing one of our weaknesses as INFJ\u2019s is our perfectionism. Not like OCD, but perfectionism in our idealism. \n\nI personally struggle a lot with what I refer to as \u201cthe guilt God\u201d. Raised in a house where modesty and abstinence from basically anything enjoyable made it really difficult for me to understand why I would want to live in such an extreme way, or the way I was taught was required to be a \u201cgood Christian\u201d. This is why when I went to college and really got to live on my own terms I drifted from my faith. \n\nAnd, because of my tendency for idealist perfectionism, seeing both the way the world treats faith and how it was packaged to me as a child, the most important factor of Christianity was lost on me: we\u2019re *supposed* to come as we are, not having to perfectly fit the mold and know we\u2019re not perfect. I had gotten so wrapped up in this \u201cI have to be perfect or what\u2019s the point\u201d which was a slippery all or nothing mentality. \n\nThis realization has really helped me in my journey in making my faith my own. Naturally it opened another can of worms in my mind of what\u2019s wrong with the world but as an INFJ this isn\u2019t my first or last time realizing something like this \ud83d\ude02",

                "I had a unique experience with religion, I think. My birth family was Jehovah's Witness but by the time I was 10, I was in foster care. Each home I went to had a different denomination. A Mormon, a Baptist, a Lutheran, a Catholic, and even the Nondenominational. Being a part of each household and attending church gave me a sort of outsider's perspective. Each one believed in a higher power, God. Each one had a set of rules to live your life so that you may enter heaven. Each one was very critical to those outside of their influence, even other Christain based faiths. \n\nHere's the thing, I saw that each one was trying to achieve the same thing and most of their habits were the same. No drinking or drugs. No murder, no stealing, no cheating...etc. They all wanted to live their best life to be good enough to get the better place, heaven. They use religion to keep them on a 'good' path and give all the credit, either good or bad, to God. There is no accountability for oneself. The ultimate act of faith is selflessness. And therein lies the control. \n\nAfter turning 18 and no longer being required to attend church, I started to ask myself what I believed which of course sent me to research the subject as best as I could not being a theologist and going to school for it. I started with the history as seen by the outside world, not the revised version the churches gave. I learned that most have cross over, most are so similar because they were trying to so hard to replace pagan beliefs and the only way, they could in a lot of instances were to have something similar but reframed to fit their own teachings. I.E. Christmas and winter solaces. Easter and spring equinox. Blood sacrifices and Jesus on the cross. \n\nA lot of people struggle from internalizing these teachings and breaking free to find yourself and your beliefs can be very difficult. Many people turn toward spiritualism because they find a relationship with a higher power without the man-made rules that twist something so beautiful up into something so ugly. Give yourself permission to discover what you believe in by doing research of many different religions and belief systems. You aren't committing to anything right now, just learning about them and in the process, you will find your path and take back control.",
                "I grew up a \u201cdevout Christian\u201d; attending Christian school and then bible camp during the summers. At 18 I began questioning how other religions could hold truth if Christianity is \u201cthe only way to salvation\u201d. That led me down the path of seeking objective truth, and I realized the indoctrinated version of Christianity I had been taught in the west was heavily false due to how theological it had become - lacking spiritual basis and accuracy. Ironically filled with duality and ego instead. People in the west take the bible very literally, which the bible itself refutes. The bible is comprised heavily with symbolism and metaphors. - the Orthodox church attests to this and is the incentive of modern Christianity, which says it all. \n\nAfter looking into other religions (Taoism, Judaism, Buddhism) I was stunned with how much overlap there is spiritually. When reading the bible on my own terms, specifically the gospel, I realized Jesus preached non-duality, and that the \u201cKingdom of God\u201d mentioned in the bible equates to enlightenment. The oneness of all reality is extensively proclaimed in the gospel of John. I\u2019m still a Christian, but one who believes religions are different perspectives from different cultures and rich history, all connecting to the higher power in a way that is familiar to them. \n\nUltimately, religion won\u2019t connect you with God; your state of being - awareness and compassion is what does. Religion helps put things in perspective and offers heavy clues.",

(that's my opinion at least), and we're humans in the end we live and sin and do good deeds, etc. we're forgetful beings and have brains, and the ability which is called freedom of choice for a reason, we do what we choose to do, and live with the consequences, whether we can handle them or not (Our current world mistakes), and whether it's divine or not.

Went to a public school in elementary, an Evangelical Christian private school for middle school, and a Baptist private school for one year of high school, then back to public school.  All over the place.\n\nMy experience ranged from altar boy, to devout believer, to atheist to now, some kind of weird agnostic.  I can relate to that identity crisis of yours.  There is no scientific way to prove a god exists.  Yet, there are some profound things in this world that are very much unexplainable.  Religion being part of humankind since the dawn of humanity.  And lending credence to some sort of spiritual pursuit being grains of wisdom passed down to me from many elderly people when answering how they're long-lived, happy, and lived a full life.\n\nMy take on religion is it makes you feel something unworldly inside.  IDK what it is.  Feels like being content.  Feels like humility.  Feels like the assuredness that things will be OK in the end.  Feels like peace.  Feels like an inner happiness.  Feels like...positivity.  I still adhere to an agnostic belief that whether or not a god exists is unprovable by human means.  But I'm weird because, even though I believe this, I value going to church, value the teachings of the priest during his homily, and value socializing with fellow parishioners and my family.\n\nThere's some good things in religion.  Good teachings, good lessons, morals, etc.  There's bad as well, like contradictions, the Bible speaks of justified murder and genocide, and some weird AF rules about rape being justified.  It's whack, man.  But again, there's some good in there too.  Which is why I, personally, cherry pick.  I don't ignore the bad.  I just embrace the good and use it to try to be a good human being.  \n\nDo I believe in god?  I believe there's \"Something\" out there.  IDK if it's an entity, a group of entities, some weird cosmic energy, or freaking aliens, IDK ---- just \"something\" that we humans will never actually know about.  And that's OK.  All that matters, really, is love.  Family.  Happiness.  Being content.  Setting positive life goals.  Accomplishing life goals.  And leaving behind some sort of legacy, a mark on the world, be it via art, lessons, friendships, buying a home to pass along when we die, or children, some sort of legacy.

I started noticing weird things about religion and how people reacted when they discussed their beliefs or tried to answer rational questionsz\n\nExamples:  why don\u2019t we use the same justice system in earth that god uses on humans?  If god changes something in his plan, isn\u2019t that a demonstration that one way was less good than the other negating his \u201cperfect\u201d state? Why did god punish the serpent in the garden by taking its legs and cursing it when it wasn\u2019t real serpent, it was the devil disguised as a serpent, or controlling a talking serpent. That\u2019s a like sending Elvis to jail because a bank river wire an Elvis mask during a crime. Or why is it wrong to punish children for their parent\u2019s crimes when god uses inherited sin as the primary reason for our eternal guilt.\n\nPeople were quick to turn to ego defensive methods and reactions when asked these questions. That told me they didn\u2019t know any more than I did, that they were religious for psychological and emotional reasons they didn\u2019t even notice they were using. \n\nSo I searched and waited for better evidence to convince me there really was a reason to think impossible things were really true, but all I found was examples of people doing the same thing all over the world with the same unearned conviction, just different stories and rituals. That tells me humans have a built in tendency to attribute stuff to the supernatural and then rationalize away the parts that don\u2019t make sense. If they do it then I must be susceptible as well.

Lots of lying and coveting.\n\nMore years later...\n\nLots of tax evasion through religious properties by more than one religious group. Basically having cattle, produce and other crops grown on church owned land with a nice large mcmansion and swimming pool in the middle of it.\n\nPastor's daughter running around in a nice shiny red convertible being a very rebellious and promiscuous teen.\n\nTold god loves all including the sinners and preached to turn the other cheek. Then the bible talks about killing babies and genital mutilation and other violent acts. Also if god is love and he knows all then why would he be angry and punish others so severely let alone kill them. Lots wife. God would know all about how the mind works and exactly what to say and to who. Also if there are a bunch of angels why not task them to educate and broadcast your message.\n\nIf god knows all and has a plan then you have no free will and john 3:16 is not possible its a lie. Because you can't actually choose without free will. So anyone going to hell, or dying in a peaceful or violent way is preordained to do so before their own birth. It's part of the plan.\n\nThis means ALL things good and bad are part of the plan. Global warming, murder, suicide, sexual misconduct, children out of wedlock, being bullied, war, nukes, pollution, racism, poverty, starvation, paracites, false accusations, cancer, insert anything bad for you, all of it.\n\nBut what about the good? What about love, happiness, family, friends, beautiful sunsets, barbecues, gentle breezes, etc? This also means that you get these according to God's plan. Some of us get only one parent, some of us get 4 great parents, some of us get big families, some of us get upper income families with plenty of medical care, some of us get vacations and cruises, some of us get good times with friends. But not all of us. On a world population scale not most of us.\n\nIt is to be preordained who experiences joy and suffering before you set foot on the stage. You are predetermined to lose your job or get hired. Why pray for someone to get better when you are told its all according to plan? Just wait it out. It will happen one way or another. And if you never find out about something, that also was part of gods plan or will.\n\nIts the ultimate Santa's list. Except you can't actually choose to do better to move to the nice list. And for some reason a lot of the bad kids get toys and not coal. Same the other way too.\n\nIf the church officials lied or where wrong... And there is free will... Then again not a great answer. Because you are given free will to choose but the \"book\" has been edited over so much time that what are you really choosing? If a god really cared about being chosen and having its message out there, it would make sure the bible was never misrepresented and mistranslated. Which it has been. So god doesn't care or is not that all powerful as advertised, or just left the universe.\n\nAlso it is mentioned in the bible that God has ranks of angels one rank seems dedicated to just signing praises to god. A mention in ISAIAH 6 of one. Why do you need us lowly mortals who cannot do it better than angels do it? And why does a god have a dedicated immortal cheering section? How conceited is that?\n\nAlso why give free will then have humans accept said god and follow all the rules then still have some go through more pain and suffering then those who reject god? Also all people who accept god do not get  the same lot in life. Even as a kid it did not make any sense. It all sounded like a mash up of BS over time. \n\n\nTLDR: if there is a god that cares about its message / will on earth / humans / or even punishing humans... It would never let its message and requirements for heaven be misunderstood, misrepresented and preached by pedophiles and thieves. Also it would have the strength to do something about it.",

That\u2019s generally left me to identify mostly as agnostic, which is less of a religion and more a personal belief. But I would say I mostly align with Catholicism since it\u2019s as much a cultural part of my family/background as it is a spiritual one, and I find it hard to imagine that\u2019s something I could just shake off like nothing.

Regardless of my own ability, it was only when I was homeless and recently beaten and robbed that I considered giving the Bible some consideration. In hindsight I realize that, excuse me but I'm going to speak \"Christianese\" for a moment, my heart was hardened to a religious idea of Jesus rather than who Jesus Christ actually is. It's only when I was able to look at Christ through a new and fresh and authentic perspective that I was able to understand anything more than a mere set of rules that Christianity offers. Because that's not even what Christianity is. It's not supposed to be approached as moralistic therapeutic deism. It's supposed to point out the objective wrongs I've done via Old Testament Laws, the fact that I bathe and rejoice in [some of] those objective wrongs, and that even in spite of that God saved me - not because I'm good, but because He's good. If I love Him back, I'll pay it forward.

And if I have prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. If I give away all I have, and if I deliver up my body to be burned, but have not love, I gain nothing. Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; it does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth. Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never ends. As for prophecies, they will pass away; as for tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will pass away. For we know in part and we prophesy in part, but when the perfect comes, the partial will pass away. When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I gave up childish ways. For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I have been fully known. So now faith, hope, and love abide, these three; but the greatest of these is love.\r\n1 Corinthians 13:1\u202d-\u202c13 ESV*\n\nEdit: for a summary of Christianity, I'd recommend the movie [American Gospel: Christ Alone](https://youtu.be/ocHm18wUAGU) (don't be fooled or discouraged by the title, 'American' has nothing to do with the Gospel) and/or [Mere Christianity by CS Lewis Doodles](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9boiLqIabFhrqabptq3ThGdwNanr65xU) on youtube.\n\nu/AbysmalMemes",

But I have also met many who are not. And the way I seperate them is that some Christians believe that we should shame others and make them feel bad for their beliefs.\n\nAnd I don't agree with that. Love thy neighbour, after all. To me, it is about respecting others, and if they want, talk to them about my beliefs if they are open to it. But really, what others do  isn't my business.

Like the good samaratin in christian belief, or how Buddha teaches to help others in buddhism.\n\nBelief can do a lot of great things if you choose to have an open mind.

                "I was raised in a home that was very loosely Christian. My parents were divorced before I could form memories; dad was agnostic and mom said \u201cJesus was who he said he was\u201d and she explained the concept of grace. That God loves every one of us, and you don\u2019t earn your way to Heaven by following every law; (impossible) but you just accept his love. You also had to forgive others to be forgiven. She said you only needed faith the size of a mustard seed. When scared or in need or particularly grateful, you should pray to God. We went to church on Easter a few times and that was it.\n\nMy paternal grandma was a wonderful Christian lady; warm, welcoming, exceedingly kind to children, visited the sick and infirm. Not preachy or judgmental. She told me \u201cGod loves you and is always there with you; if that makes you feel hopeful, good; if it makes you nervous, check that your heart is in the right place.\u201d She also said she chose to believe in Jesus, and if when she died it turned out she was wrong, her faith still bettered her life. I like this because it shows humility; it wasn\u2019t \u201cI\u2019m definitely 100% right in my views of God, and anyone who believes different than me is going to Hell.\u201d That stance has always bothered me\u2026 how can you know 100% you\u2019re right? The answer usually has to do with the scripture and it\u2019s inerrancy, but that\u2019s debatable. I think of my grandma and how she lived her life and I think she was a good example.\n\nWhen I was 13 I started going to a church within walking distance all by myself. I got baptized and it was meaningful to me. I\u2019ve gone to church intermittently since throughout my adult life. \n\nAround age 34 I decided to examine my beliefs dispassionately. I read a book that gave a summary of every major faith. Although Buddhism appealed to me somewhat, Christianity still stood out to me because the concept of grace. I understand it through a parent-child lens: we\u2019re all siblings, and the rules against \u201csin\u201d are just meant to keep us from hurting ourselves or each other. Grace = it\u2019s impossible to be perfect and instead you should trust God to guide you how to have kindness in your heart, be humble, be repentant when you inevitably mess up, forgive others. \n\nAny loving parent wants their children to be kind to each other & themselves. I try to hold onto this core belief and not get mired down in debates about minutiae. Does God want me to humbly love all my brothers and sisters or does he want me to arrogantly examine and judge them as though I\u2019m the arbiter of Heaven? Jesus was pretty clear on this I think, when he humbly washed the feet of his disciples. \n\nI\u2019ve met Christian people (even married one) who were very dishonest, judgmental, self-righteous, and didn\u2019t seem to have understood the concept of grace and love at all. These interactions have sometimes dampened my faith. But we\u2019re all hypocrites in one way or another. We\u2019re all on our own journey. \n\nAt this point in life I couldn\u2019t stop talking to God in my everyday life if I tried. So my mom\u2019s words ring true to me. Faith the size of a mustard seed, and knowing Jesus was who he said he was, is all I need. God loves us.\n\nJust my two cents!",
                "I was born and raised a Muslim but never truly knew or understood my faith until I moved to the US and was exposed to other cultures, identities and religions outside of mine. My initial understanding of my faith was heavily influenced by my upbringing (which focused strictly on the rituals of religion without an understanding), social circles, media and local places of worship until I started to go on the path of self-discovery. This initial understanding was very superficial and fragile (which I think is often the case for people who grow up in a bubble).\n\nI am curious in nature so I took World Religion (and Intro to Philosophy) in college to learn about other belief (non-belief) systems and loved it and this kick started my own desire to learn more about my faith - which dictates my own values, morals, ethics. \n\nI often reflect on life and how short and unpredictable it truly is and the meaning/purpose of it. The question of good/evil in our world, justice (and lack thereof) and the suffering and all. There is one universal and ultimate truth: we will all experience death, regardless of what we believe or not. And as I learned more about my faith, I found more peace and tranquility with all of these questions and curiosities.\n\nThis self-discovery and learning of my faith ultimately pushed me to be more spiritual in nature than material and find a balance in my day-to-day approach to life and its trials/tribulations and become a better Muslim and a better human.",

                "Raised in fundamentalist Christianity in southern USA. Went to Christian private school and everything. Became agnostic towards the end of high school, but I had zero role model figures to talk with outside of Christianity. One of the things that got me to leave the church was actually learning about Myers-Briggs. As ridiculous as it sounds, I was being taught that science was a satanic conspiracy meant to dissuade people from religion. My ISTJ father believed this. When I got into researching MBTI and applying to the world around me including scientists like Einstein, (INTPs etc), I realized that the driving force behind science was curiosity not malice.\n\nSo I became agnostic and went to college. I couldn\u2019t think about my childhood or the people I grew up with without having anxiety. I began having dissociative problems and memory loss problems. Had what was almost a psychotic break (constant intrusive thoughts, severe anxiety/ dissociation), but fortunately it was contained. I managed to be successful in college despite having odd mannerisms and despite struggling with severe dissociative problems. \n\nHad to mature into the knowledge that my parents were wrong and raised with into the wrong kind of thinking and now I would have to relearn a perspective from scratch, but also that I shouldn\u2019t blame them. They didn\u2019t mean to be misguiding. \n\nI actually returned to Christianity (but not fundamentalism) after 5 years, and the way that happened was when I read the Bhagavad Gita, which is a Hindu scripture. It contains a profound respect for humans. Seeing that made it possible for me to reframe my experience with Christianity, which is seriously problematic and upsetting in a lot of ways, but also, offers the possibility of being a better person and experiencing God\u2019s peace.

First off you seem to have a healthy curiosity about religion but beware because that may make you vulnerable.  I also detect a fair amount of hostility towards Christianity in the posts as well because when we were younger it was shoved down our throats. My mother grew up on a farm in Ireland and trust me we know nothing about Christianity being shoved down our throats. I like that bunnies369 mentioned John especially. I am no Jesus freak but I like to read and John especially touches my heart. It\u2019s mostly because of his unending loyalty towards Jesus(who by the way was suppose to be an INFJ) and I\u2019m sure John was as well.  But John could be considered a very good friend if not a best friend.  Who was there when the Pharisees judged Jesus? John was the only disciple there of course peeking his head up and letting Jesus know he wasn\u2019t there alone. John was the only one awake at the Garden of Gethsemane, John was the only apostle at the crucifixion along with Mary the mother of Jesus, Mary Magdalene, and Mary of Cleofas(Supposedly John\u2019s mother) and of course John (\u201cthe disciple whom Jesus loved\u201d or \u201cJohn the Beloved.\u201d That\u2019s how they refer to him in the whole New Testament.

I got to the point where I couldn\u2019t suspend my disbelief anymore, mostly because of how cruel the world can be with seemingly no help from God. I tried taking the good things from religion only, but it never worked because of my INFJ need to be authentic; I didn\u2019t want to do religion half-assed, so I was thinking I\u2019m just on my own permanently.\n\nA few months ago, however, I started meditating and found my spirituality; there was one particular session where I was shaken because I felt like I had heard and felt God; it was very powerful, and I could have had a major identity crisis but strangely, later that same week, I learned about Gnosticism in a whole separate context (just checking out the Great Courses). It was an eye opener. It\u2019s the idea that we can find knowledge of God/the Divine through our own knowledge and by looking inside. It employs parables like the Bible, but it\u2019s more metaphorical and it deals with the fact that the God most of think of as God is so unbelievably cruel. It\u2019s because it\u2019s a lower deity, an imperfect one, and the true Father is trying to reach out to us, if we only try to listen. \n\nIt\u2019s made a big difference for me, because now I don\u2019t feel like I have to follow all the Bible\u2019s and religion\u2019s rules to talk to God, and I don\u2019t get angry about people using God\u2019s name to do shitty things anymore, because I can remember that they are under the control of the \u201cfalse\u201d God. It\u2019s very interesting and the writings about it are ancient, with some scholars believing it to predate the Bible, and in fact it includes \u201capocryphal\u201d gospels. \n\nBeing able to pray again without feeling bad that I\u2019m not good enough has made a big difference for me!",

                "I grew up in a Catholic country, but my parents were Hindu leaning hippies. So I got a lot of contradicting information about the nature of life and death and thankfully my parents were very \"love is love\" in their approach to life, so I went to Catholic class for Grandma until I decided I had enough of the horror stories in 3rd grade and joined some Muslim refugee kids making drawings at the back of the room. I liked praying in a negotiating way as a kid. \n\nThen we moved to Asia and I took a liking to Buddhism, and read a lot about other religions after I lost all belief after tragedy and incessant prayer and offers did nothing, and decided God or any diety doesn't exist after all. \n\nAs an adult I took a liking to Taoism and here I am, having developed something of a concept of my own and once again talking to the universe, believing in energies among beings, but also questioning if I am just making these things up so I don't feel like my life is pointless and happenings are out of my control.\n\nWhat I realised too, as to the \"as an INFJ\" is that what felt like a religious moment to me in my youth, a \"idea that came from God\" or a \"sign from the universe\" was often just my intuition, my subconscious putting prior information and subtle observation together, and giving me astounding insight. But then I didn't trust myself, so I had God as a backup to give me confidence and move forward. Does that make sense?",

I see religious texts mostly as just wisdom being passed down, mixed in with control as a means to do it. Aswell as getting people to abide to the same values, laws etc. But it\u2019s sad for me to see so many people disinterested in religion. I think there are things to be learned from these texts without being religious. Perhaps thousands of years of human wisdom are in them.",

I attend the Latin Mass because both the worship and the people there (despite flaws) are more authentic and sincere. Despite many clergy today being absolutely terrible, it's hard to doubt the historicity of the faith as well as the sincerity and authenticity of the Saints.

                "So, I was born and raised in suburban Texas to parents who moved here as young adults from Korea (a very poor country ruled hy dictators) and met here. On my mother side, while extremely poor in Korea, she grew up going for free to Protestant schools, as did her seven siblings. Because of this, despite her parents not being Christian until moving to America in her very late teen years, she had a very positive opinion of religion. Living on the fringes of society, they felt like Christians were unique in caring about them. On my father's side, the family was very traditional and Shamanistic until moving to Texas, in my father's very late teens, as well. My grandmother, as a minor, almost became a shaman, as she was picked out by one during a sword dancing ritual, but her own parents did not want the life for her. I don't believe they also had any opinions of Christianity until moving to the US.\n\nShortly after moving to the US, my mother's parents seemed to have converted, as well, while my father's mother had the same experience; my father's father never lived in the US and died a handful of years after the rest of the family moved to America. While I do believe my parents, their siblings (one in-law was a very successful, agnostic surgeon who walked away from the money to struggle to be a preacher), and, on my father's side, aunts/uncles, and cousins were/are true believers, it genuinely felt, to me, like a social club. Somewhere that we went to mingle with other Koreans.\n\nBoth families largely became Baptist, including my own parents. Growing up, I attended church regularly and very much moved it. I was excited to go every week and looked forward to events during the week. However, while it installed in me a sense of a loving God, looking back, it felt like religion was secondary to making sure I grew up in a Korean bubble. Now, I grew up in the Bible Belt of the US as a Southern Baptist. I also visited other Korean churches of various denominations very often, being invited by friends or because my parents heard they had good programs for Korean learning or something. For me, as a child, Christianity was never about hate. We were never taught to be against LGBT+ or abortion. Heck, as someone who believed myself to be gay (later realized I was bisexual), I was very much accepted by my peers and almost all bias I ran into in the community had to do with traditional Korean culture, not Christianity.\n\nI will add that I met a single Jewish person in elementary school; Jews just aren't very widespread in large portions of Texas. The teachers seemed welcoming and were very open to the girl, a classmate, talking about her experience, and she is how I learned about the Holocaust. I learned more about Jews and their history in high school but never met a practicing Hew again. Not one, at least, open to me. Also, I technically learned about Jews in church, but, because church for us kids was more about God and love, I didn't really connect the dots between the people in the Bible and modern day Jews. Being in suburban Texas, there were also many Muslims among my classmates. They never spoke about their religion, but they seemed nice enough, and everyone got along. I learned a little more about Islam and its history in high school and uni. I have always had Atheists or Agnistics around me, but, in terms of religious beliefs, they didn't really talk about it \n\nAnyhow, as I got older, I drifted apart from religion. I didn't see anything wrong with it, but the way I was taught made me feel a bit isolated, as if God or religion had nothing to do with me. In the early parts of this period, I still went to church once or twice a month and, on a couple of summers, volunteered during summer school. At this point, I jumped churches a couple of times, and my antics, being a mix of class clown and bully, led me to being sort of friendless at my churches, while very popular at high school and uni, where I focused my social life. By my early 20s, I was an agnostic, believing in something more, and on occasion became an absurdist.",

I feel very similar about your take on religion - I\u2019ve learned and see that it\u2019s a sham of what it claims to represent. What Jesus represents is an important factor in how I conduct my life, peace and love and truth, although I often stray from the pious. \n\nI\u2019ve also studied Buddhism, Hinduism, and all sorts of spirituality.

Mormonism has such a unique lore that my intuitive mind would feast on it. However, as a teenager with a budding sexual energy I began to see the darker side. \n\nI dealt with a lot of sexual shame from my teens to early 20s. Being sexually active before marriage is a huge no-no in the church. In Mormonism the only way to get right with God is by confessing sexual activities to the local bishop (local pastor that is over 500ish members) Usually the bishops would refrain me from doing church activities for a while in order to get right with God. Which is quite humiliating as your whole community can see you are \u201cdealing with something\u201d because you can\u2019t participate fully in church. I think being an INFJ kinda screwed me in this way. I knew to my core that the only way to get back to God was to self-humiliate myself by confessing to the bishop and then suffering the external consequences.  While I knew a lot of people would just lie and never confess to their bishops. \n\nI dealt with this for years. A vicious cycle of casual sex to numb, feeling awful about, refusing to go to church because I knew what I\u2019d have to do to get right with God. And then eventually succumbing to the pressure and confessing. \n\nLater in my 20s I did a deep dive of church history. I already knew a lot of the disturbing parts of Mormonism (polygamy, institutional racism, misogyny etc.) but I justified each negative part in my mind. But by my mid 20s when I started to fully examine the church I could plainly see that there is no way this is the one true church. \n\nThis is where I\u2019m thankful for being an INFJ. By holding a high standard for God and then seeing the actual church history. I was able to clearly realize that the church is a fraud. There is no way a loving God would uphold institutionalized racism. An honorable all knowing God would never ask leaders of the church to marry multiple underage girls who do not know what consent means. And many more issues that Mormonism has.\n\nLike many of you I have a jaded image of organized religion now. I\u2019d say I\u2019m quite spiritual still.

So i went and studied other paths, religions, even dabbled with esoterism and such. I needed answers not for \"if God gud y bad thing happen\", but rather on the NATURE of God. On the purpose of it all, how it worked, on the larger pattern and plan.  \n\n\nI spent years searching, delving deeper and deeper, investigating, debating, always looking for the ultimate answer and... Whelp. All of a sudden, it hit me. In my pursuit of the ultimate Truth, i had forgotten to take a breath and realize my answers where there all along. All paths, ultimately led the the same answers. All thread, part of an intricately woven tapestry of immense complexity, yet astounding simplicity.  \n\n\nAbstinence or modern issues were never a problem for me, quite the contrary. I had moved away from the Church as it had began leaning towars the world so strongly, and away from God. It stopped making sense until i realized that the issue is, and always has been, people and their understanding (or lack of thereof) God and the transcendent.  \n\n\nSo i went from Catharism (a medieval gnostic heresy that made A LOT of sense to me at the time) back to Catholicism. One stetp at a time. I've since did my best to bring back those who left, and explain they \"why\" and \"how\" of things that our clergy has long forgotten, or cared, to explain. The concept of sin, for one.   \n\n\nReligion is a great thing, as it brings order to the chaos of modern spirituality, which isn't much in itself if not a quest for things that have always been there but lost to the endless precipice of modern day quest for individualism and self-centered edonism. Something no one can really claim to be devoid of, in fairness.",

I've explored different religions throughout the years...and every single one seemed so cultish. I think there is no singular God. But more of a collective consciousness and we should be grateful for everything in nature because it's all alive...and conscious."

                "The Fat Friar was both\n\na) a wizard, and\n\nb) under religious vows\n\nso there must have been religious activity in the wizarding community at some point. To what extent that\u2019s still true **now,** I\u2019m not sure. How wizards might be distributed among **different** religious traditions - like the Goldsteins and the Patils - is also a bit of a mystery. But some wizards were clearly doing \u201creligion in SOME form\u201d for a while. Magical practices and faith practices seemingly aren\u2019t inherently contradictory or antagonistic - in some cases they may be, but not all.\n\nIt occurs to me that religion in the wizarding world might be really interesting. Follow my logic here?\n\nBetween things like Dementors and Horcruxes, it\u2019s fairly clear that wizards have souls. If souls don\u2019t exist then what are Dementors doing when they kiss you? It\u2019s also fairly clear that some actions and choices - the creation of a Horcrux, for example - have lasting, **devastating** effects on the state of your soul. Given that this is the case, wizards have very compelling reasons to be interested in the various religious options.\n\nQuestions like *what exactly is my soul? What do I need to do to look after my soul?* become **really important** when you already know beyond doubt that souls are real, and that they can be distorted or destroyed by the wrong choices.\n\nWizards are in a fascinating position. In some ways they have certainty that Muggle believers would give anything for\u2026but in other ways, the things they\u2019re sure of would make those personal religious decisions that people make really, really matter.",

I feel like that character could be an interesting person, too, or the fat friar could continue to do religious services. When I was 12, I was Christian and religious, and I think if my parents found out I need to go to a school for witchcraft/wizardry, like a private boarding school that was very far away and they wouldn't hardly see me for most of a schoolyear, they would have been more amenable to the idea if it had a priest on the schoolgrounds. But if Hogwarts is a multi-faith school, it would still make sense to offer something non-denominational for students who wish to engage in worship or find solace in religion. I feel like that would make it easier for religious Muggleborn students to leave their families, or for the families to accept them leaving, especially given how demonized witchcraft is/was in the world. \n\n I know JK Rowling was trying to avoid the question of religion explicitly, but it gives me more questions by ignoring it. It feels like an obvious gap when Harry's suffering in his grief for Sirius that he turns to so many other people without being comforted by either a spiritual counselor or a therapist, especially if a wizard priest does exist for Dumbledore's funeral & Bill & Fleur's wedding. Surely other students have been in similar circumstances and grieving.

We blame religion for the things man does. Buddha, allah, Jesus etc. never told anyone to use their name or belief in VAIN. Yet when humans use religion  to control people (which I\u2019m pretty sure is a sin in most faiths) or twist their religion to kill people (AGAIN ANOTHER SIN) do we blame ourselves no lmao we blame the religion. \n\nI just don\u2019t understand how if somebody calls themselves religious and participates in things ungodly howwwwww do we still \ud83d\ude02 take them seriously.

That way when y\u2019all see somebody \u201creligious\u201d do some dumb sh*t or live a faulty lifestyle y\u2019all wont blame the religion instead y\u2019all will have common sense and blame the person for their misdeeds.

The other religions if you don't do this or that exactly how it is meant to then you're going to hell. Hinduism is lenient when it comes to that.\n\n\n Further when I conversed with Muslims I often found that even if they say God loves them they do everything out of fear of God. They unknowingly fear the very God that 'loves' them. But in Hinduism, if practiced right perfectly shows the mutual love between the bhakt and bhagwan. Like pundalika who kept Shri Krishna waiting at his doorstep so he could tend to his parents. From an abrahamic religion perspective this would be an insult to God but Shri Krishna was instead happy to see pundalika choose his parents first and happily waited at the door on a brick thus taking the beautiful form of Vitthala (Vit meaning brick)",
                "The difference is Hinduism allows rational discussion and debates about the faith, the reason why so many school of philosophies and sects coexist peacefully in Hinduism.\n\nJust look at Bhagavad Gita, Arjuna is a skeptic and asks questions to Krishna about his doubts. Even when Krishna answers he asks to clarify. And at the end after answering all Arjuna's doubts, Krishna says to him It's his choice at the end, with this knowledge do what you like.\n\nIf it was any Abrahamic God, that god would have sent Arjuna to eternal hell for questioning the faith. Do you think a Muslim and Christian is allowed to question the Quran or Bible? No. That would be a blasphemy for doubting God's word.\n\nWhen debating with someone from Abrahamic faith, I often ask this question \"If **Hinduism is a false religion, why did your GOD allow Hinduism to exist for nearly five thousand years? While he sent two prophets in the middle east in 600 years period?** Did God forgot about Hindus or God likes Hindus so much that despite two Abrahamic invasion in the subcontinent Hinduism is still thriving? Why did your GOD sent two prophets in the desert but ignored one of the advanced civilization in history? \" And They have no answer. LoL. They end up calling me names like idol worshippers.\n\nBut then I ask the question again \"If you think Hindus are worshipping Idols then you must believe Christians are worshipping the cross, and Muslims are worshipping the Kabba.\" I give them reasoning like when you talk to someone in a phone, do you believe you are talking with a phone or the person behind it? They have no answer, then again they resort to name calling.\n\nThe hate against religion like Hinduism is inbuilt in their religion, it's written in their scriptures, that's how they justified their prosecution during the invasions.\n\nI remember one Christian missionary complaining why YOGA is the biggest religious mission in the world. Christianity spends billions for its missionary projects, but Hinduism is getting the same influence naturally without any funding whatsoever. They are pissed at the acceptance of dharmic beliefs in the west and entire world. \n\nUnlike Abrahamics, Hinduism is a continually evolving religion, true to its name, sanatan dharma. After the first scriptures, Vedas were composed, Hinduism evolved tremendously. The many scriptures and schools of philosophies speak for themself. Hinduism is still evolving.\n\nBut Abrahamic religions like Christianity and Islam, are still stuck in the past. They try to apply their stone age logic to the modern age, but it doesn't work any more.\n\nAbrahamics have to have blind faith in Bible and Quran as they belive they are word of god, and think shouldn't be doubted or questioned. That's considered blasphemy, and in Islamic countries punishable by death.\n\nBut once they start having doubts, and their entire belief falls apart.\n\nBeliefs based on blind faith without any rational discussion shouldn't be called religions, they are cults.",

This largely reflects the Protestant and Catholic majorities (often the loudest and sending the most missionaries abroad). Oriental Orthodox and Eastern Orthodox have philosophies that are somewhat more aligned to Dharmic though. Those earlier Christian traditions seemed to have incorporated Ancient Greek mysticism and possibly even Buddhist thought into their philosophy. They believe in things like \u201cTheosis\u201d (becoming or unifying with God as our true nature), the Devil is not inherently and evil opposite to God - but a fallen angel/ deity that chooses to ignore God\u2019s laws, and hell exists, but not a burning place you go to (more of a state of life and afterlife that occurs when one chooses to live a Godless life). These orthodox communities definitely still have criticisms of Dharmic religions, but it\u2019s far less black and white than the typical Protestant and Catholic rhetoric that we are used to. They also don\u2019t have missionaries and believe that their faith should be found by outsider on their own instead of preaching to \u201cnon believers\u201d (I have a family member who grew up Hindu and is converting to Orthodox Christianity. I was confused and concerned, but after learning more it\u2019s actually not too different. I\u2019m actually exploring it for my own family as we are coming from a multi faith background).",

How does this work? how do you remove karma so quickly?  - Read the satanic bible, it has some good critical thoughts on Christianity and other similar religions e.g. Islam etc.   \n\n\nOur religion teaches us that we must let go of material world and seek spirituality, Follow Dharma and live a truthful life where we serve the community and look after those who need to.

                "The \"no true scotsman\" fallacy only applies to arguments in which you move the goalposts based on the behavior -- it's not a fallacy at all if the behavior in question is generally agreed to be at odds with the definition.\n\nTry it out:\n\n* No truly law-abiding citizen would murder someone, because it is against the law to murder someone\n* No truly immortal person would die, because the definition of immortality precludes dying\n* No true Scotsman was born in America to Lithuanian parents and has never visited Scotland\n\nThe reason the \"no true scotsman\" fallacy is a *fallacy* is because the only thing required to be 'truly' Scottish is to be *from Scotland.*\n\nOn the flip side, Christianity is an organized religion with an agreed upon theology. One can certainly say things like:\n\n* \"No true Christian believes Jesus wasn't the son of God,\"\n* or \"Every true Christian believes they must try their best to emulate Christ,\"\n\nand so on. Now, compound that with the fact that many Christian denominations genuinely *do not believe* that other denominations are \"true Christians,\" because they define Christianity according to their preferred theology, and your position gets even more indefensible.\n\ne.g., that Neo-Evangelist almost certainly believes the Catholic *isn't a Christian at all.* Does the Catholic have to believe the Neo-Evangelist is part of the same group as them, if the Neo-Evangelist doesn't?",
                "I guess it applies to all groups, nothing is as black and white as you say. If everyone \u201cis a true\u201d something or \u201cisn\u2019t a true\u201d something, that means the most moderate, centrist democrat is exactly the same as an anarcho-communist, and the most moderate, centrist republican is a neo-nazi.\n\nYou can say they are the same, and that one group \u201cdisavowing\u201d another part isn\u2019t valid since they are still part of the same side of the larger binary you set up.\n\nThe world isn\u2019t this simple. If people both worship the Christian god and have *widely* divergent beliefs I think it\u2019s disingenuous to see them as holding the same beliefs.\n\nBeliefs exist on continuums and evade simple categorizations. I challenge you on that front",
                "It's all a matter of perspective. I'm guessing by the tone of your post you aren't a religious person so you have a different set of criteria of what makes someone a member of said religion than a practicing member of said religion.\n\nCorrect me if I'm wrong, but you seem to think that if a person professes belief outwardly in their religion and incorporates it into their lifestyle then they must be a bonafide member, right?\n\nI think that a lot of practicing christians would disagree with you, and even the Bible would disagree with you. To them, someone paying lip service to the idea that they're a Christian but then consistently having a pattern of living an unchristian lifestyle is a sign that they generally don't have a relationship with God.\n\nIn fact the Bible talks about people like this in the book of Revelation. This is what Jesus has to say regarding people who profess belief but without conviction or action.\n\nI know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish you were either one or the other! So, because you are lukewarm\u2014neither hot nor cold\u2014I am about to spit you out of my mouth!",
                "Christianity is an ideology, though, not just a group. If you don't act according to an ideology, it's not untrue to say that you're not a true X.\n\nThe \"No True Scotsman\" fallacy refers to groups that any person has an objective adherence to, not just a subjective one. To be considered a Scotsman, you only need to be born in Scotland, hence there's not such thing as a \"false Scotsman\" that was born there. You're not born a christian. To be considered a Christian, you need to agree on certain rules and behaviours, and if you don't act accordingly, it's not untrue to say you're not a true Christian.\n\nAlso, there's the fact that Christianity has a lot of different groups that vary wildly, very wildly, between them. Which brings me to the next point:\n\n>A humble, accepting, loving moderate Catholic is absolutely a part of the same group as a Neo-Evangelist who uses their platform to disenfranchise minorities and spread hate and fear.\n\nThat's not true in any sense of the word. A catholic has nothing whatsoever to do with a neo-evangelist. In fact, they don't even belong to the same religion. A Neo-Evangelist might be acting accordingly to his own sect of Christianity, but it certainly has nothing to do with Catholicism.",
                "> If you can explain to me why one religous individual can realistically say another isn't a \"true <insert religion here>\" without it being a fallacy (or someone obviously making a mockery of <aforementioned religion> and not trying to genuinely be one,) I will take that as a flaw in my view.\n\nFirst of all, the fallacy of the No True Scotsman only applies when someone redefines a term *during the debate/discussion*, when they're presented with a counter-examples against their initial definition, and want to salvage that definition. The prime example being the claim that no \"true\" Scotsman puts sugar in their porridge. The fallacy does not apply if someone merely uses a \"strategically chosen\" definition that you or others don't agree with.\n\nSecondly, yes there are Christian beliefs that are considered so fundamental that if someone were to deny them, they technically can't be a Christian, like:\n\n* Belief in one god, who is loving, merciful, and just.\n* Christians believe that Jesus is the son of god, both divine and human. They believe that he was born to the virgin Mary, lived a sinless life, performed miracles, taught about the kingdom of God, and expressed the love and mercy of God in his actions and parables.\n* Crucifixion and resurrection: Christians believe that Jesus died on the cross to atone for the sins of humanity. They believe he rose from the dead (resurrection), which offers us the promise of eternal life.\n* Salvation: Christians that humans are sinful and can be saved from sin and its consequences through the sacrificial death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.\n* The Bible: Christians believe that the Bible is the inspired word of God.\n\nThere might be some minor variations that are specific to different denominations, but in general these are essential to being a \"true Christian\".",
                "I don't think it's really a No True Scotsman fallacy, though. A Christian is a Christian, if they claim it, then it's true. I think it's just calling them a hypocrite. Someone who *says* they follow Jesus, but *do not* follow Jesus, by not feeding the hungry or clothing the naked or loving their neighbor or what have you, isn't 'not a true Scotsman'. They are saying one thing and doing the opposite. That's hypocrisy, whose definition is \"a feigning to be what one is not or to believe what one does not : behavior that contradicts what one claims to believe or feel\".",

If not, what basis is there to make that distinction at all? If there is none, then it\u2019s impossible to change your view.",
                "Christians (and others) have fought literal wars over who is and who is not a \u201ctrue Christian\u201d. These doctrinal differences are and have been a big deal.\n\nYour view that these \u201cmake no difference\u201d is very flawed.",
                "Growing up in synagogue I always learned that the primary fundamental difference between Jews and Christians is the belief for the latter that JC is the Messiah. I feel pretty comfortable saying that so-called \u201cMessianic Jews\u201d (formerly known as Jews for Jesus) are not \u201cReal Jews.\u201d",
                "The no true Scotsman fallacy doesn\u2019t apply because the argument isn\u2019t shouldn\u2019t be they aren\u2019t Christian, Muslim, or Jewish the coherent argument will be that they aren\u2019t practicing their faith correctly due to the individual\u2019s misinterpretation. This is a common example of a strawman against religion where you blame the actions of the individual on the religion because it\u2019s easier to blame the group for the actions than it is to hold the individual accountable. Additionally it allows one to maintain their prejudices and misunderstandings of doctrine because they can show how a misinterpretation or failure to live by a code is an indictment against the philosophy.",
                "It's the kind of thing that comes up in any sort of identity that exists without a properly authoritative definition. You get the same sort of thing in political stances or movements (broad \"ism\"s, I mean, not parties or organizations). If there's not clear threshold to say \"This person _is_ and that person _isn't_\" and no clear act of accepting or rejecting someone or some act, you're going to have squabbles, both over peripheral matters like you're talking about as well as over relevant but contentious matters.",
                "It's all made up in the first place so there is no issue with individuals making things up for themselves.",
                "Yes and no. Yes, the no true Scotsman fallacy does occur commonly in religious discussion when adherents actually change the definition of a \u201ctrue ___\u201d during the course of the discourse. An example would be an interlocutor defines a Christian as \u201csomeone who believes the writings in the Christian Bible\u201d. Then you claim that Christians are homophobic. *Then* the interlocutor makes a post-facto change to their own previous definition of Christian by claiming that \u201cno true Christian is homophobic\u201d. Even though the defined \u201cChristian\u201d as someone who believes the Bible, and there are homophobic writings in the Bible, they want to move the goalposts. \n\nWhat is *not* an example of the no true Scotsman fallacy is correcting misnomers. If a person or group does/believes something that is contrary to the definition of that religion, but still *calls themself/ves* adherents of that religion, it is fair for the interlocutor to claim that they are not true adherents. E.g., if a Jew is defined as some me who believes in only one God, and you make the claim \u201cJews believe in more than one God, look at (this fringe group that calls themselves Jews\u201d. It is not a fallacy for the interlocutor to say \u201cno true Jew believes in more than one God\u201d. That\u2019s not changing the definition - it\u2019s just holding your claim up to the definition to verify consistency.",
                "I totally get what you mean, but sometimes a person is not something even if they call themselves that.\n\nIf a KKK white supremacist Trumper called himself a Muslim for one day so he could shoot people and call it Islamic terrorism, is he a real Muslim?",
                "It isn't usually actually a fallacy in this case (as another pointed out, it's really about moving goalposts anyway, which you've delta'd). \n\nIt's a matter of imprecise definitions in the first place. \n\nChristianity is just too imprecise to apply the term \"true Christian\" to... without further clarification. \n\nWith further clarification, such as \"follows the specific direct teachings of Christ as laid out in the Bible, including XYZ\", then *of course* you can talk about \"true Christians\" with those qualifications. \n\nOr if they specify a clearly defined sub-sect with well-established dogma (i.e. rules the apply by fiat of an authority) such as the Catholic Church, then of course it makes complete sense. \n\nThe problem, of course, is that every sect and even every individual thinks it's *obvious* what they mean by \"true Christian\", when in fact it can mean many, many things. \n\nSo without further clarification, what we have is not a \"One True Scotsman\" fallacy, but a miscommunication. \n\nIn the mind of the person speaking, *they* usually *correctly* don't think their definition has changed to exclude an odious counterexample, but the *listener* doesn't really have any way to know it's not an example of the fallacy, because they really haven't clarified *either*.",
                "I think for ideologies, in general, there's more than just the label to go to, there's the ideology itself.\n\nSo, e.g., in a secular context you could say \"that guy wasn't a scientist\" not just on the basis of whether he wears a labcoat or holds a degree, but on whether he follows the scientific method.\n\nSimilarly, a \"true Christian\" or a \"true Muslim\" or a \"true Jew\" can be judged not just from which temple / church / etc they go to, but to what extent their behavior matches the dogma of their religions. In this sense a \"true Jew\" is rabidly homophobic b/c of Leviticus 20:13.  It's not entirely or always negative though, as it certainly would make sense to say a \"true Christian\" turns the other cheek.",
                "You can choose to see the world without nuance. You can decide large groups of people with a lot of variation in their beliefs all think the same thing. \n\nThat\u2019s the foundation of racism, sexism, nationalism etc. you\u2019re just picking religion to judge with a broad stroke instead of a race or nation.",
                "This disallows anyone anywhere to have a definition of what it means to be Christian.  It's a \"you are one if you say you are\".  If I say \"i'm a christian and god doesn't exist and jesus is a myth\".  Do I have to believe that you're a christian?  \n\nEvery other example is just a gradient here.",
                "It is very pervasive in religious context because religions include so incredibly many people and claim moral superiority. That mix leads to individuals disowning whoever doesn\u2019t fit their own version of superior morality.\n\nThe massive population and claim of moral superiority isn\u2019t unique to religion. We also see also see it in politics (not that there isn\u2019t overlap between the two). You\u2019re likely familiar with the term RINO (Republican in name only), used to disown any Republican who doesn\u2019t toe the party line (or whatever the individual saying it seems the ideal party line to be).\n\nSo when you say it\u2019s more pervasive in religion than anywhere else, you might be right\u2026 but I think that it\u2019s so close in politics that we really can\u2019t know which it\u2019s more pervasive in without a massive study that just isn\u2019t worth the effort. I\u2019d suggest amending your view to it being extremely pervasive in religion but not necessarily more than *anywhere* else.",
                "There have to be rules involved in the demarcation of in-vs-out groupings or words basically have no meaning and anyone could just define themselves as anything. \n\nWe usually use *a priori* images as a basis for this demarcation (I.e. I can say \u201cI\u2019m black\u201d but if I don\u2019t look black you\u2019ll say \u201cno you\u2019re not\u201d). We may also use lists (\u201cI\u2019m a member of the blue man group\u201d you go ask the blue man group HR department and they say \u201cnever heard of him\u201d)\n\nThese are the two easy ways. Now how do we define the members of a group that don\u2019t keep a membership list and don\u2019t look a certain way? Generally when it comes to religion we start developing heuristics to determine if they are a *true Scotsman* or not. \n\nThe \u201cno true Scotsman\u201d fallacy boils down to someone, usually a member of an in-group, using fallacious or incorrect heuristics to define another as a non-member of said in-group, generally for the purpose of winning an argument (and, I would argue, generally in bad-faith)\n\nSo let\u2019s talk about Christianity. Many atrocities have been carried out in Jesus\u2019 name. David Berkowitz, the son of Sam killer, carried out 8 murders and claimed that god told him to do it. Especially since he later reneged on the god premise we can say that for certain he\u2019s not a godly man but just a murderer and discount him. Similarly we can say it\u2019s not christian to mass genocide natives by deliberately giving them smallpox blankets. I think you\u2019d agree saying \u201cDavid Berkowitz was no true Christian\u201d is a reasonable supposition. So where\u2019s the line?\n\nThere\u2019s the rub, eh? It, like much of life, is contextual. I would suggest that to be a Christian means to follow the doctrines of christ, whatever they may be (I\u2019m a Jew so I\u2019m hazy on the specifics). And I would agree that catholic priests who fiddle children for example aren\u2019t real Christian\u2019s. \n\n*That said* there is absolutely something rotten within the Christian identity and institutions that encourages this kind of bad behavior and while it may not be very Christian of you to fiddle a kid it certainly seems part-and-parcel to hate gay people for whatever reason.",
                "Your position is inherently contradictory and therefore cannot be argued.  The \"no true Scotsman\" fallacy is still a fallacy.  Are you asking people to CMV to explain how a fallacy is not fallacious?",
                "Atheist here. Hate religion, want it to die off as a concept. \n\nBut in their defense, most religions have some method of kicking a person out of the religion.\n\nMormons have disfellowship, Catholics have/had excommunication, it's a widespread concept.\n\nFor instance, Arthur Gary Bishop, a serial killer from a\nUtah, was excommunicated by the Mormons for embezzlement.\n\nThe main problem with this viewpoint is that most churches don't automatically excommunicate people who commit various grievous crimes.\n\nFor instance, take Catholicism. It automatically excommunicates anybody who assaults the Pope physically, or procures a completed abortion. But no mention of sexual assault. \n\nThe closest to a condemnation of sexual assault is Canons 1378 and 977. 977 prohibits a person from giving communion to anyone they've had unlawful carnal relations with (ie rape), and 1378 excommunicates anybody who violates 977.\n\nSo while yes, if someone has been excommunicated they may be called no true Catholic, or Mormon, or whoever forced them out. But the problem is actually having them officially expelled.",
                "The nature of fallacies is that they can't be taken in good faith. The true Scotsman resolves in there not being any \"true\" examples. Christian as a title actually helps in granting a favourable interpretation thanks to the numerous schisms of the religion.\n\nChoosing to interpret \"[x] isn't a true Christian\" as [x] doesn't uphold the values of my denomination of Christianity is less problematic. On a larger scale, the Westboro Baptist has been disavowed by the largest baptist groups because \"Neither the style nor substance of their preaching expresses the historic, orthodox Christian faith\". By the weakest definition members of WB are Christian, but the disavowment from their peers would suggest they are not true baptists, not aligned with the defining values of the baptists. They are also not Catholic, Protestant, reformist, or Amish.\n\nAs an exercise in frustration, this same fallacy is rampant in the Martial Arts sphere, particularly with the division between sport and traditional systems. Aikido is a poster child in this (rokas and Dan the Wolfman) \"true\" aikido is somehow both a compliant flowing style that never really works in competition, but also a direct and brutal style that exists in all fighters. Martial Arts end up with a similar issue where each club can claim to be any tangentially similar style and not be technically wrong, but other practitioners will say it's not the \"true\" example of it",
                "Christians believe that all people are sinners. \n\nIf you sin \u2014 you envy Elon Musk, you murder schoolchildren, whatever \u2014 but accept the Christian faith, you\u2019re a Christian.  \n\nIf you hold non-Christian beliefs \u2014 you don\u2019t accept Jesus as the messiah, if you think God created inferior races, if you think you are *allowed* to envy Elon Musk or murder schoolchildren \u2014 you aren\u2019t in any meaningful sense a Christian. \n\nOf course, it\u2019s very difficult to detect from the outside what someone is really thinking. If someone does in fact commit envy or murder and he tells you he isn\u2019t sorry for his deeds, but is still a Christian, you can\u2019t say authoritatively he isn\u2019t a Christian \u2014 he might be lying, he might be secretly filled with remorse over his wickedness \u2014 but it\u2019s a good bet.",
                "There's a critical distinction that I think most people engaging in that fallacy fail to make - and one that is present in your argument as well. Specifically, the omission of the word \"rightful.\"\n\nI'm a Norse polytheist. *Believe me,* we have some deep-seated problems with sectarian factions that promote hate and prejudice; I could practically write a thesis on the how and why that happened, but it's not directly relevant to your argument. There is also a substantial movement of zealously inclusive, pluralistic, intersectional thought within our tradition. Those of us aligned with those ideals can often argue from the literary body of the tradition - the Eddas - better than our opponents (see the youtuber Ocean Keltoi or the author Ryan Smith for examples of this in practice) as well as citing historical and archaeological evidence to support our positions as not just ethically correct from a contemporary perspective but better aligned with the cultural practices of our spiritual ancestors. Academically speaking, we are \"truer\" Heathens than hate groups like the AFA or Odinic Rite.\n\nThat said, it would be intellectually incorrect to label them as \"*not* Norse polytheists\" because as warped, uninformed, and harmful as their views are, they genuinely claim to believe in the same gods that we do. Enter the qualifier *rightful.* Unfortunately, the prevailing attitude in most debate spaces and broader society is that a reduction of a position to its simplest and strongest conclusion - I call it sloganizing, but I don't know if there's a more formal or widely recognized term - is a winning strategy and admitting to nuance or exception is evidence of a weaker argument.\n\nIt is not, therefore, a reliable indicator of bad faith that a person applies some iteration of the No True Scotsman fallacy in defending an ideology or religious tradition; they want to make a strong, unequivocal statement, particularly in the examples you and I have illustrated of standing *against* hateful and harmful interpretations. Now, I'll certainly give you that there are \"ostrich members\" of any ideology or belief system who will slap that statement on as a boilerplate and do nothing further to oppose those negative positions, tantamount to just \"sticking their head in the sand\"  - but that does not account for everyone. I posit that it is instead just a *stronger* indication of good faith if a person acknowledges the nuance and qualifies their statement with the word *rightful* - \"hate has no rightful place here\" ensconces tolerance as the orthodoxic view and condemns prejudice as the deviation.",
                "\"No true Scotsman\" is only a fallacy if it's only brought up in the context of claiming that a group contains no members with a specific characteristic or practice; it's logically sound to bring it up when your intent is specifically to revoke group membership from someone due to their practices or characteristics. So if I say no Scotsman puts sugar in his cereal whilst in a panel discussing different cultures' breakfast rituals, and then say no *true* Scotsman sugars his cereal when presented with evidence to the contrary, I'm engaging in a logical fallacy; however, if I witness Noah eating a bowl of Frosted Flakes and tell him that he's no longer a Scotsman because no true Scotsman takes sugar in his cereal, I'm at least being logically consistent whilst being utterly unreasonable.\n\nSo to put this in the context of religion, if someone argues that Christians are kinder, better people and all examples to the contrary aren't real Christians, that's a logically fallacious statement. On the other hand, if a pastor witnesses some of his parishioners bullying a gay child and admonishes the parishioners that their behavior is unChristian, that's both logically valid and morally right.",

                "Oh boy, the \"No True Scotsman\" fallacy, a favorite pastime in religious circles! It's like a bagpipe solo at a heavy metal concert, unexpected and bewildering, yet oddly fascinating. But let's dissect this Haggis of an argument, shall we?\n\nYou've got a point when you say that it seems religious folks enjoy playing this particular logical fallacy card more often than not. It's like a 'Get Out of Uncomfortable Argument Free' card. But is this uniquely a religious thing, or is it just more noticeable there? Let's see.\n\nIf we boil down the infamous \"No True Scotsman\" fallacy to its essence, it's essentially an attempt to protect a generalization from counterexamples by changing the definition in an ad hoc fashion to exclude the counterexample. In the religious context, it's \"No *True* Christian would do such a thing!\" Well, that's a mighty convenient shift of goalposts, isn't it?\n\nIt's important to note, however, that the \"No True Scotsman\" fallacy can occur anywhere people identify strongly with a group or ideology. Whether it's sports teams, political parties, or even die-hard fans of a particular pineapple pizza (yes, those strange creatures exist), people often find creative ways to exclude the \"bad apples\" to preserve their cherished group's image. So, while it might be more visible in religious discourse, it's not exclusive to it.\n\nNow, to the core of your query: Can one religious individual realistically say another isn't a \"true\" adherent of their shared religion without invoking the fallacy? Well, it's tricky. If we're discussing clear, accepted tenets of a faith that someone blatantly disregards, one might argue they're not practicing that religion accurately. \n\nBut here's the catch, most religions are like a box of chocolates; there are different interpretations and practices within the same tradition. So, while a vegan chocolate truffle might insist that it's the \"truest\" form of chocolate, the caramel-filled milk chocolate next to it might beg to differ. \n\nSo, yeah, when it comes to defining what a \"true\" follower of any religion looks like, we're essentially stepping into a theological version of \"Who's on first?\" It's a fallacy-riddled rabbit hole that leads us straight into the Absurdistan of subjective definitions.\n\nIn conclusion, while the \"No True Scotsman\" fallacy is indeed pervasive in religious discussions, it's not an exclusive resident. It vacations frequently in the land of politics, fandoms, and any place where humans hold strong group identities. And to avoid falling into this logical pitfall, maybe we should all just try to be \"true\" individuals first before anything else, ay?",

As long as these systems remain well defined, it is perfectly logical for sects to exclude those that do not fit their definitions.",
                ">homophobic  \n>  \n>Adj  \n>  \n>\"having or showing a **dislike** of or prejudice against gay people.\"\n\nChristianity is homophobic. It regards homosexuality as a sin and therefore a forbidden lifestyle for Christians to follow. Many many desperate, sad people in the Protestant sect try to twist scripture into a knot by making blasphemous, out of context reads to create a false image of a Jesus who is loving and kind to all, even the **unrepentant** sinner. This is all well and good if you're trying to make your own religion that does not follow christ, or john the baptist, or paul the apostle, but is a total farce if you want to be in Christs flock. Don't believe me? Ask someone with a Theological degree. \n\nHeres the thing though, Christianity is all about **free will**. Atheists frequently ask \"why is their bad men in the world if God is real?\", the truth is God could make you an angel and give you **no choice** but to make the right decision, but thats **not Gods way**. Its up to us to come to Christ and take him into us fully and truely, and repent of our sins. You don't have to be a Christian, he doesn't force you (which is why Babies aren't born with a Cross branded on them). God wants you to, and will give you the chance to even after death before your judgement, but doing so is up to you.\n\n>Back to the topic at hand more centrally\n\n1 Corinthians 3:16-17\n\n\"Do you not know that you are a temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in you? If any man destroys the temple of God, God will destroy him, for the temple of God is holy, and that is what you are.\"\n\nSo as you see, they're not wrong. Someone who simply \"goes to church\" is not someone who follows Christ, because the eternal temple is within. This is one of the central teachings that removes Christ from Judaism. No amount of bowing or Tithing will redeem a man who does not hold Christ in his heart.",

                "Ideals are ideals cause they are not commonly achieved, those who practice any belief system understand that they are working towards being better at embodying an ideal. Many religions and systems of thought happen to fall into a weird place where they have an ideal form similar to platonic idealism. This is to say that when a person who claims such a system of thought strays from the ideal in a certain way they are essentially relinquishing themselves from being part of that way of thinking (becoming a person who only claims they are of a belief). For example a person is sober can only claim sobriety as long as they are consistently sober. Another example could be a nonviolent person, they are only nonviolent as long as they consistently abstain from violence.\n\nThere is also the false equivalency common within racists where race is considered to be a source of behavior and not an irrelevant external factor that is convenient for low brows to rally around. I think the previous statement is easy to agree with but this also goes for people who retaliate to past happenings when the aggressors are dead and all that remain are descendants and even they are few. Such retaliation can be as simple as claiming debts from people based on phenotypical features.\n\nI know some of this can be perceived as off topic but these behaviors stem from an aesthetic of logic that logic being \"Attributing behavior X to group Y on grounds of considering group Y homogeneous and responsible for all behavior of individuals who seemingly belong to group Y\". The No true Scotsman \"fallacy\" (it is officially seen as informal) is most commonly deployed as a rebuttal to character assassination via using an outlier or uncommon happening as fuel for debasing the morality and thus the legitimacy of an ideological opponent. I do recognize that larger statistics can be employed to legitimately associate behaviors with other factors but it is exceedingly uncommon for people to conduct such research without confirmation bias and even more uncommon for reporting on findings to not double down on such biases. \n\nThis is all to say that that your current lens is highly susceptible to less savory schools of thought. If you wish to associate behaviors with groups please do your research and understand that everything is susceptible to bias take everything with a grain of salt, remaining open minded is how we prevent future Galileos, holocaust victims, Armenian Genocides, Japanese American internment camps, (This list could probably go on and there are certainly events that we don't have in recorded history that stemmed from closed mindedness)\n\nThis isn't even a slippery slope fallacy too you are already at the destination, If you are willing to associate negative behavior to a group via outlier behavior that is already the same tribal tendency.",

                "I said the same thing when I was 27, except I was sitting on my bed crying to a God that I wasn\u2019t sure was hearing me, then ended up kneeling on the floor begging God to end my pain and tired spirit, but that I wanted to live and stay live, I just needed my pain to end because I was tired. I said I\u2019m sorry for anything I\u2019ve done and I\u2019ll do anything to make it go away, I\u2019ll stay alone for the rest of my life... Then I cried for hours like wailing crying, sorta slept for like two hours and when I woke up it was a brand new world. I was high off life, like I drank massive amounts of coffee, sun was brighter, trees greener, and I felt so much joy and peace. I felt brand new, like nothing in the world mattered\u2026. I walked outside and immediately felt soo much love for the world and every human in it. I cried when I saw a prostitute in the corner. I ran and gave her a hug. I didn\u2019t practice any religion when I did that, but I knew it was God that saved me. I was sensitive to everything, enhanced senses. I went on a search for answers and then I heard Jesus while on my bed tell me that what I felt, the peace, love, joy,  and overwhelming compassion was what he felt, even after the world rejected him and killed him he still loved us. He told me that the feeling I got was because he gave up his life so I could be brand new again, so that the world could be brand new again. I highly recommend asking God to forgive you for everything you\u2019ve done wrong and crying out to God. Beg God for mercy in the shower while washing away your dirt. You don\u2019t have to physically die to see God, you can meet him during your lifetime while still alive if you want. God will lead you to the right \u201creligion\u201d.",

The gospel accounts in the Bible, for example, are filled with details of real life people, places, events, customs, and things (see [here](https://coldcasechristianity.com/writings/a-brief-sample-of-archaeology-corroborating-the-claims-of-the-new-testament/)).\n\nI know the emotional agony is hard, but that's a good thing because it shows you care.

You're feeling overwhelmed and it sounds like you're in pain. We don't know what's going on and you don't have to disclose it but know that all pain ends. Maybe not forever, maybe not tomorrow, but at some point, it can and usually does get better. Sometimes we just need others to help us get to that better point.

This is my view as with many Christians.. God knows you, what you're going through, what's been done to you and your circumstances. He hasn't forgotten you or abandoned you. Christians believe in free will. We are allowed to choose how we live but the downside can be that everyone is allowed to make choices and with that, their choices can hurt others. As maybe someone has hurt you. In the new testament Jesus died for our sins. Just the simple acceptance of that...that someone a very long time ago took on everything for you matters. You don't have to know everything about every faith, or religion right now. If Christianity is speaking to you at all just know there is hope and peace in it for many of us. He may be with you at this very moment in your pain encouraging you to reach out for help..you started doing that with your post..maybe continue that by reaching out to a hotline or something and as you do, pray.

                "You dont have to search religions, you only need to call him. God will answer you definitely. \n\nLet me tell you something about world religions. To begin with, Christianity and Judaism worship the same God. Christianity knows Jesus and Judaism doesnt. Thing is, GOD is inevitable. Wherever you go, there he is. Whatever you do, He sees it. Whatever your pain be, He knows it. He is infallible and is the only truth. It is outrageous to carve an image and bow down before it and say this is God. No it isn't. It is mere creation. God is seated high above the heavens in magnificent glory. Except Christianity, no other religion ever even claimed to be the only truth. \n\nJesus did. He said, I am the way, the truth and the life. Jesus alone loves everybody irrespective of colour, caste, creed, sex. He loves us. God is love. The epitome of love is seen on The Cross where his love ran red. Yet He gladly allowed himself to be the sacrifice for the sake of reinstating our life with him. Like lost sheep we left him and embraced sin, stepping toward the grave every second. Out of his selfless love, He delivered us. \n\nJesus loves you. He is real and He wants to talk to you more than you want to talk to him. No other religion assures you this except the true path of God, Christianity and you are a child of God. Cheer up!",

                "First, I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re feeling that heavy burden. But, I would encourage you not to give up. God has given you a brain to think logically and there\u2019s strong evidence in favor of Christianity. Also, the #1 piece of evidence in any Christian\u2019s life is the personal evidence of God working in their life. And what I personally always go back to is the fact that Christianity is the only religion where God came down to save us. In ever other religion, they will tell you, \u201cdo this, do that, and you will be saved.\u201d But, with Christianity we understand the fact that nobody could \u201cdo enough or be good enough\u201d to reach God\u2019s holy standard of perfection. Heaven is a holy place inhabited by a holy God (most if not every religion would agree with this fact). So if that\u2019s a general fact amongst differing religions, why would a holy and just God let a sinful (imperfect) person corrupt the holiness of heaven. The short answer is he is doesn\u2019t let that happen. The Bible says \u201cwithout the shedding of blood there can be no forgiveness of sins.\u201d Because of this, there had to be a payment for the sin we committed so that God\u2019s wrath would be exhausted. This is where Jesus comes in. He, being God in flesh, came down from the perfection of heaven to live in this awful world that\u2019s been corrupted by sin. And not only did he live here, but he performed miracles, taught with authority, and called people out of their sin. But most importantly he loved the perfect life that nobody could ever live. He went to the cross and shed his blood for us and now he gives his perfect righteousness to those who would repent and believe in HIS work and not their own. And on the third day he rose from the dead which showed that death had no dominion over Him and death has no dominion over those who place faith once again, in HIS work. On top of this gospel, there\u2019s books after books about the historical evidence that backs the resurrection and crucifixion of Jesus Christ. I would encourage you to look into those, but most importantly remember this \u2014 no other \u201cgod\u201d has ever died for you. No other \u201cgod\u201d would come down from perfection in heaven to save you from yourself. Christianity stands alone in their views on salvation \u2014 not your works, but faith in God\u2019s redeeming work.\n\nI know this is a lot, but I genuinely hope it helps you. This life is a journey. It\u2019s a marathon and not a sprint. Call out to Christ and he alone can save and give you a peace that surpasses understanding. His burden is easy and his yoke is light. God bless",
                "This is an important question that deserves a good answer. A mere claim of truthfulness isn't helpful - every worldview can do that with no effort. We need solid evidence.\n\nFirst, we need to start at the beginning. We know the universe had a definite beginning, as evidenced by:\n\n1. [The Second Law of Thermodynamics, or the concept or entropy](https://www.livescience.com/50941-second-law-thermodynamics.html)\n2. [The universe is expanding from a single point, as observed by Edwin Hubble in 1929.](https://hubblesite.org/mission-and-telescope/hubble-30th-anniversary/hubbles-exciting-universe/measuring-the-universes-expansion-rate)\n3.

[The ripples in temperature that would be required to form galaxies from the Big Bang were discovered by NASA's COBE satellite and announced in 1992.](https://www.nature.com/articles/443489a)\n5. [Einstein's theory of general relativity, which predicted the expansion of the universe, cosmic background radiation, and ripples in temperature, also requires an absolute beginning to time, space, and matter.](https://history.aip.org/exhibits/cosmology/ideas/expanding.htm)\n6. [It is in principle impossible for an infinite amount of time to ever have passed.](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/justin-taylor/why-an-actual-infinity-cannot-exist-and-therefore-we-know-that-the-universe-had-a-beginning/)\n\nIf the universe had a beginning, there must have been a point at which it did not exist, logically followed by a point at which it did exist. The universe came into being.\n\nWe know the universe had a cause, because all things that come into being [require a cause sufficient to explain](https://www.umass.edu/wsp/method/history/outline/simplicity.html) their coming into being. There are no uncaused events - that's a logical contradiction.\n\nWe know there are two basic types of causation: [event causation and agent causation](https://www.encyclopedia.com/humanities/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/agent-causation). Event causation happens when an extant effect (an event) acts as the cause of another effect, while agent causation happens when a meaningful choice is made by a \"chooser\" (agent) and this choice causes the effect.\n\nWe know that event causation cannot be the ultimate cause of the universe, as event causation taken alone leads to an infinite regress ([turtles all the way down](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles_all_the_way_down)). Ultimately, the first cause of everything must have come from an agent.\n\nBecause we know that the cause of the universe must have been sufficient to explain the universe, we know that this cause:\n\n1. Is an agent (Had a mind capable of choosing)\n2. Exists independently of time, space, and matter\n3. Is capable of creating time, space, matter, and energy, or the legitimate precursor thereof\n4. Is intelligent enough to create the universe that we observe\n5. Did not come into being and therefore does not require a cause for itself\n\nAt this point, we're talking about a god. In fact, we require a single, uncreated, and personal God to make sense of our observations. Polytheistic views are not supported by this evidence, nor are views which require created or impersonal gods. There are essentially three extant views which explain these facts in a consistent manner.\n\n1. Judaism\n2. Islam\n3. Christianity\n\nAs it turns out, the truthfulness of each rests on whether or not Jesus of Nazareth rose from the dead.\n\n1. If modern-day Judaism is true, Jesus died on the cross and did not come back to life. ([Sanhedrin 43a:20](https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.43a.20?lang=en))\n2. If Islam is true, Jesus appeared to die, but was instead taken to God. ([Quran 4:157-158](https://quran.com/4/157-158?translations=22))\n3. If Christianity is true, Jesus died and was raised from the dead, appearing later to many witnesses. ([1 Corinthians 15:3-8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2015%3A3-8&version=NIV))\n\nTo determine which is true, we need to look at contemporary primary sources.\n\n1. [Josephus Flavius](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2848/2848-h/2848-h.htm)\n2. [Celcus](https://www.bluffton.edu/courses/humanities/1/celsus.htm)\n3.

Unless you have read the Bible yourself, I don't think you need to worry about it because the difference in denomination can be over big and little things. For some its as simple as how they view infant baptism. However ultimately if they call themselves Christian then they must be united in Christ. Remember at the end of the day, the Bible clearly says what true religion is, meaning we should affirm what we believe through the scripture aka the Bible.\n\n*\"Pure religion and undefiled before God the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.\"* (James 1:27)\n\n*\"All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:\r That the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.\"* (2 Timothy 3:16-17)\n\nGod does not want you to be sad, and while he will indeed convict you at times either through guilt, pain, suffering or otherwise. That does not change the undeniable fact that he loves you and has loved you even while you were a sinner and has known you before you were formed in your mothers womb, even before the beginning of the world (Ephesians 1:4). Does he want you to stay a sinner? Absolutely not. Does he know that your not perfect? Absolutely yes. He sent His only begotten Son for this very reason after all, who would then become the truth, the light, and the way for all peoples of all nations to his Father's glory, kingdom, and power (John 14:16).\n\nThese were some of the words that Moses in Deuteronomy 31:6-7 gave to the Israelites who were passing unto the promised land when he himself passed the leadership role from himself to Joshua: *\"Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or terrified because of them, for the Lord your God goes with you; he will never leave you nor forsake you.\"*\n\nMaybe your problems are stemming from another source or feedbacking off of each other into an endless source of despair. If so then what you most likely need is to speak to someone, a therapist might not cut it, and if it has to do with religion then speak to a pastor and your family if they care about you, wherever you can find God's presence, that is where you need to go. However, if speaking to them once doesn't work, then do it again, do it with someone who wont take advantage of you either because that is not what God wants. If you can, go and be near someone who you can break in front of, but who will be willing to help you pick up the pieces. **Therefore in all this, seek God and seek His (Father/Son/Holy Spirit) Kingdom first.

For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore you ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you. God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwells not in temples made with hands; Neither is worshiped with men's hands, as though he needed anything, seeing he gives to all life, and breath, and all things; And has made of one blood all nations of men to dwell on all the face of the earth, and has determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation; That they should seek the Lord, if perhaps they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us: For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring. Therefore then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Deity is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and man's device.\r And the times of this ignorance God overlooked; but now commands all men everywhere to repent: Because he has appointed a day, in which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he has ordained; and of this he has given assurance unto all men, in that he has raised him from the dead.\r And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked: and others said, We will hear you again of this matter. So Paul departed from among them. But certain men joined unto him, and believed: among whom was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.\"*\n\n(ESV) (Hebrews 11:6)\r  \n*\"And without faith it is impossible to please him, for whoever would draw near to God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him.\"*\r  \n\r  \n(ESV) (Matthew 6:33)\r  \n*\"But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.\"*\r  \n\r  \n(ESV) *(2 Peter 1:10)*\r  \n*\"Therefore, brothers, be all the more diligent to confirm your calling and election, for if you practice these qualities you will never fall.\"*\r  \n\r  \n(ESV) *(Hebrews 11:1)*\r  \n*\"Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen.\"*\n\nGod Bless you. I pray that wherever you are or may be, God is with you and that you see in yourself and strive to be what God wants you too. For God sees the heart, and He (Father/Son/Holy Spirit) wants you. With this I pray you, me, and all others who believe in Jesus/Yehoshua/Yeshua, the one true Son of God, can be gifted with the Holy Spirit and Fire in a way which is pleasing to the Lord (Father/Son/Holy Spirit), and to be driven to do what God wills us to. Meanwhile for those who have yet to accept the Lord, I pray that God opens your hearts, eyes, and ears to His (Father/Son/Holy Spirit) glorious ways so that you turn from your sins and choose Him (Father/Son/Holy Spirit).",

                "I am not a fan of religion, but here me out. Religion in all of its forms is abusive, anti-science, and dogmatic. It should  and is something that humans will evolve out of 1,000 years from now. However, I have no evidence to support my claim, so this is just a thought experiment.\n\nOn this planet, all living organisms follow a repetitive pattern: gather resources and reproduce. Whether it's plants growing bigger for more sunlight or a predator animal eating a prey animal. When it comes to animals, external stimuli always trigger a physical response, and the brain instinctually interprets that as either a flight or fight reaction regardless of whether it's predator or prey experiencing the stimuli.\n\nThe only animals that \"bypass\" or \"pause\" this and change are apex predators. Cetaceans, canines, felines, Avians, and apes (including humans). These animals' diets require strategic planning and higher social skills within their own species. With this, two things seem to happen:\n\n1. The apex predators generalize and can adapt quickly to their environment; form big familal groups; develop \"cultures\" between groups; and focus on socializing and having prolonged post-birth child support.\n\nor\n\n2. The apex predators specialize in their environment and struggle to adapt if their environment changes too fast. These animals are usually really big in size; isolationist in nature; and only socialize to mate or fight for territory.\n\nHumans have fallen into the first category. Humans got so good at this that we abused the crap out of this socializing system and passed on tips, tricks, and tools for the next generation. It got to the point where we had to develop talking and writing in order to remember.\n\nI would say it was around this time when humans became conscious and started to philosophize. Natural phenomena would be explained the best humans could understand without testing, and thus, religion is born.\n\nNow, to my claim, I think that without religion, humans would have no sense of danger. Extinction by curiosity.",

If I could just cleanly wish it away, then sure! \n\nThe caveat is that I would like to see it replaced with another type of fellowship that religion often provides. One thing that I do miss about growing up in church is the events and stuff. Getting to meet the same people every week, eat with them, go on trips with them, etc is not something that I ever replaced after leaving.\n\nImagine if, rather than churches, we had community halls of some sort. This is a vague concept and I don't have any concrete thoughts about the exact purpose or goals but I'm just maybe envisioning that people could meet weekly to have discussions, share a meal together, and help members of the community out who have fallen on hard times. The discussions could literally be something as simple as checking in and seeing how everyone is doing. Or they could be a forum for things like open political or community events discussions, philosophical or ethics discussion, or even opportunities to occasionally educate and share interesting facts, assistance, or experiences with those in your neighborhood..or to seek advice. \n\nI'd like to see us ultimately ditch religion but find ways to foster community in the way that churches sometimes do well.",

Their faith gives them an ethical framework to work with and provides them with guidance, comfort and solace.  As long as they aren\u2019t trying to make me live by their religious standards, I\u2019m perfectly fine with them choosing to live by them.  \n\nMany religious people ARE trying to fix the world\u2019s problems, not just praying.  Many churches operate food pantries, soup kitchens, take in refugees, and lobby the government in social justice issues.  It was religious folks who took on slavery and later racism in the US.  MLK was an ordained minister.  Not every church is Westboro Baptist Church.",

Child trafficking, financial corruption, and many more. If this element was not in society, it is possible that something else could take its place. But that doesn\u2019t damn the new thing to corruption which always seems to be assumed, which is propaganda plain and simple. \n\nReligion is about belief and systems of belief. They can be manipulated, quite easily. Knowing historically governments have a tendency to inject religion into the government. Governments themselves are based off the idea that we believe that the person hired is somehow the best of us. And yet\u2026\n\nIf anything, as humans we can just simply do better as a whole.

Hey, Charles made it to 61, Betty to 63.\n\nGeorge Washington never sired children as far as anyone knows. He was probably sterile, whether or not this was because he caught Smallpox at age 19, I don't have a clue. He inherited Mt. Vernon by way of: Lawrence who had four children. Three died by age 1. The last made it to 3 or 4, and her death gave Mt. Vernon to her uncle George because her mother had remarried.\n\nGeorge married Martha Custiss, widow of Daniel Parke Custiss.\n\nMartha and Daniel had four children altogether that we know of. Two died without ever getting to 5. Their daughter died age 17, almost certainly because of an epileptic seizure. Their son died at age 26, but he did leave behind his young widow Eleanor and four children. Three daughters died shortly after birth, but the other four children lived!",

I would note that the most honored and celebrated person in the Church after the Trinity itself is without question the Theotokos, so arguing that we treat women as second class citizens is nonsensical (unless they are the sort that thinks glorifying motherhood, which we also do with her, is bad). Women are very important to the Church and hold many roles. Really their main restrictions are they cannot become priests or bishops or can only enter the altar under specific circumstances and I would scarcely call that treating women as second class.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would suggest (1) asking them to come to Liturgy, this is my advice to everyone, and (2) seeing about taking some time to sit down with the parish priest, that is also my advice to converts whose family isn't converting with them because I know families can have concerns or questions given how foreign Orthodoxy can be to western societies.",

                "There is no Russian Orthodoxy (or Greek or any other ethnicity), there is just Orthodoxy. In Russia, Orthodoxy is used as a way to legislate repressive and outrageous behaviour against women in the secular sphere. For example they legalised domestic violence to a degree - it's ok to beat your wife as long as she doesn't end up in hospital. However this is to do with Russia, not orthodoxy. Orthodoxy has no problem with women, misunderstanding and misuse of it does",
                "Christianity gave women a voice. Literally men in society had the right to beat their women and animals for disobedience or speaking up. \n\nChrist and His Church gave women the authority over themselves to not get married off to a man of her fathers choosing, but stay independent and celibate for God like men could. The churches were filled with women and slaves all with newfound freedom in faith if not in society. \n\nWe defend the widows. As was stated, \u201cneither male nor female.\u201d  Physical violence against women is not tolerated.  Even in pre-Christianity (aka Judaism) the sexual injunctions were 95% against men to protect women.  \n\nThe Champion of all humanity is a woman Blessed beyond the Cherubim and Seraphim (consider that deeply!). Those women close to Jesus are called \u201cequal to the apostles\u201d and the myrrhbearers \u201capostle to the apostles\u201d as the first to witness and bring new of Christ\u2019s resurrection.\n\nWe call everyone to be \u201csons of God\u201d, because society was patriarchal and it was the sons who received the inheritance. We are saying we expect women to join men and receive the same inheritance too, not that sons are preferred. \n\nWhile women have a distinct role in spiritual life of creating within themselves new humans to worship God; the men are recognized as having a distinct role in the spiritual life of the priesthood. There\u2019s balance, not primacy.  \n\nA man can never conceive a child, but a woman can administer a Sacrament in the moment of utmost need (I know of a blessed baptism of a person who lay dying).  \n\nCulturally, women may or may not cover their head in church.  As a lay man I can not.",
                "Religions in general tend to treat women as second-class citizens, and I don't see any point in pretending they don't. Orthodox and Catholics like to point to the deep veneration of the Most Holy Theotokos as proof of our profound respect for women, but your family is unlikely to be convinced by any amount of devotion to one particular woman.\n\nI have heard Orthodox priests say that if a woman has an abusive husband, she should stay with him, and if he kills her, God will reward her faithfulness in the next life. If you spend enough time in church, eventually you're going to hear all kinds of crazy shit, and if you deny that problems exist, and then your family happens to hear some if it, it's just going to convince them you're delusional. \n\nThe most prudent and honest thing to do is to acknowledge their concerns while explaining that, nevertheless, you see much of value in the Orthodox Faith.",

However, many women within the Orthodox church have roles as theologians, hymnographers, lawyers, Parish Council presidents, iconographers, educators, readers, and more. As Orthodox Christians, we honor and respect the differences between men and women. All are equal before God.  \n\nI usually give Dr. Jeannie Constantinu an example of a woman who is a highly regarded theologian. I have found, more often than not that most people tend to conflate theologian with clergy. [https://www.drjeannie.com/about](https://www.drjeannie.com/about) \n\n**Objection:**  The Russian Orthodox requires women to cover their heads as a sign of being subservient to men. \n\n**Answer:**  A woman may ***choose*** to cover her head as personal piety and as a sign of respect towards God. While this is common practice within the Russian Orthodox church, there is actually quite a bit of variation among Orthodox jurisdictions.  It is not a requirement.",

As he talked about in the pod episode with lady Izdihar, there's a lot of nuance to be had about religion being suppressed or fiddled with, especially in the earlier days, when they were absorbing neighboring lands.

It's understandable in context (the clergy mostly sided with the reactionary State apparatus that existed previously to socialism in those countries), but nonetheless it's a mistake. The sensible thing would have been to join forces with progressive movements within the clergy, that is, the sector which joined because they wanted to help the poor and feed the hungry. In Italy, Spain and most of Latin America they were forced to do that when fighting against dictatorships (Mussolini, Franco, Videla, Batista, Pinochet...).",
                "I think the state should be an inherently atheistic institution that actively participates in dismantling the reactionary elements of organized religious institution. Part of me even believes the state should install religious party members into power to prevent reactionaries from seeping into the church or whatever religious organization is being formed. Religion, to some extent, has always existed within humans. Many of them even have vows more consistent with a proletariat mass rather than an overtly rich bourgeois. To actively destroy every religious institution is just giving power to reactionary forces when we really don\u2019t need to",
                "I think that large scale religious crackdowns a la the Soviet Union are ineffective as well as immoral,  freedom of religious expression is a large part cultural practice for many people.\n\nHowever I also think religion can be a pretty toxic force in our world. Living in the United States, the stereotypes about ignorant, loud, and cruel Americans overlap heavily with evangelicals who will gladly throw gay kids in the street or into conversion camps. They're the same ones who cheered at \"grab em by the pussy\" and jeered that Obama was a Muslim. When my mom was a little girl those same people said her black skin was a sign she was cursed by God (look up the mark of Cain and racism).\n\nI don't know if it's fair to put that behavior on the church,  but those people absolutely want a theocracy where the church is free to collect power,  money,  and influence and thus I see no way those institutions can work in a society without hierarchies. \n\nWhich bring me to what to do about it... honestly I don't know.  Where I live, Christianity is so tied up in nationalism and militant fervor that any communist movement here would be seen as its enemy and almost certainly attacked by those groups.",

Especially in the case of the Soviet Union -- the Russian Empire was built on oppression justified by religion, and if that same religion was allowed to exist while attempting to build a new modern state, it would have been far more unstable. Nowadays, organized religion is still an absolute cancer, and is oppressive on a global scale.\n\nPeople can practice in the privacy of their own homes, I don't care. But organized religion should be done away with.\n\nBut that's okay! We can disagree on things. I respect Hakim's argument and see his points. It's a good argument, I just disagree.",
                "No. In each case of religious persecution, there was a reason, and usually they weren't bad.\n\nFor example, let's look at Soviet repression of the Orthodox faith. Seems rather bad, to somebody who knows nothing about the Orthodox faith.\n\nIn the Orthodox tradition, the king (or emperor, or *Tsar*) was chosen by God, and thus the church is subordinate to the state led by the king who was chosen by God. In practice, this tied the church to the aristocracy on a deep ideological and material level, and subordinated the peasantry to the monarchy in an ideological level by making the religious salvation of the masses a thing that could be given and taken away on royal decree. The revolutionaries who just abolished the bloody monarchy can't have religious fanatics running around telling the illiterate and super religious peasants to rebel and reinstall said bloody monarchy.

                "It's a very broad topic and whilst I generally agree I do think that there is some crucial nuance particularly in the case of the USSR. \n\nFor most of it's history the Russian Orthodox Church acted as an arm of the Czarist State enforcing the \"morality\" favoured by the Czars. During the Civil War much of the Church was actively counter-Revolutionary, as would be expected of any part of the semi-feudal state resisting a popular revolution. This gives context to a lot of actions of the Bolsheviks against the Orthodox Church and I agree with parts of their approach. As a part of the reactionary force of Czarist state the Church as it existed in 1917 needed to be dismantled and remodled to protect the new proletarian state. I do think that this was taken too far however and those excesses were a grave mistake. The USSR shouldn't have suppressed individual Christian worshippers or destroyed their places of worship and they certainly shouldn't have extended that suppression to other religions that lacked the widespread state affiliated religious organisations used by the Czars to oppress the people, such as Islam. \n\nOverall it's certainly one of the biggest mistakes but like many of the other great mistakes of the USSR (Such as the mismanagement of the purges) it came from a legitimate reaction to the material conditions of the Soviet Union.",
                "Way I see it, the problem lies with organised church and not the practices and beliefs of the faith itself (exceptions apply).\n\nThe issue with religion is how it is used by the ruling class to manipulate and \"domesticate\" the masses. Most religious beliefs out there actually preach values that are quite compatible with socialism: solidarity, equality, etc.",
                "as a christian this isnt even a question\nyes it was wrong and yet at the same time there was absolutely reactionary political power within the churches beit in russia or elsewhere. there should be a separation of church and state where the church does not feed into the reactionary elements and where the state does not impede on the freedom to practice their faith especially when theyll still be practicing it regardless, except this time theyll be galvanized against the state",

I think it was a big mistake in the sense that it made needless enemies and caused  suffering for no reason nor immedeate or future gain.\n\nI think institutionalized religion needs to be severely crippled so they dont have power to affect public policy. but there is no reason to ban the individual practice.\n\nif you want the population to slowly stop beign religious that can be done through the education system over a long period of time.",
                "I preface this by saying I absolutely despise religion, in so much as everything that it tries to sell you, is either factually wrong and for the most part corrosive to critical thinking and dialectics.\n\nThat said, I don't think we can expect ALL of the proletariat to be critical thinkers. Some people legitimately use religion as a crutch and lean on it too heavily that outright banning it will only make them more hateful. \n\nIt doesn't needs to be completely outlawed, but like with everything there needs to be a measure. There's quite one thing to ban outright sects like Scientology and Faulin-Dafa and quite another to ban Sikhizm. Reactionaries should always be ruthlessly repressed, but more moderate religions could stay perhaps? As long as there isn't any mandates teach it to younger people in schools and so on.

                "Hakim was absolutely right, and frankly everyone disagreeing needs some sober perspective. Religion has been around since almost the dawn of man, and far longer than capitalism. The power that religion holds in the minds of men is immense. It is so ingrained into society that it\u2019s almost impossible to read a single book without somehow referencing religion. Art, symbolism, philosophy, culture etc are all deeply rooted in religion Not only is religion incredibly culturally important but it is so systematically built into to the fabric of society. I have been atheist my entire life and even I pray to god when things get really fucking tough. It is almost human to be religious, albeit very antiqued? but the question of why do we exist enters every single human on the planet. And humans love answers, we crave it like a drug. Even if all of societies problems were solved I predict people will still want answers, they will still question the pointless question, they will think about creation, death, purpose, motive, inspiration, existential thoughts that are clearly impossible to answer and likely pointless to think about. And yet we do, and some people are not satisfied like i am, with a nihilistic who knows who cares. \n\nReligion may  become very small from socialism, however it will not disappear over night, it will take years  if not centuries. And instead of pushing for it\u2019s downfall we should look to work with religion as they could be a valuable political ally. \n\nHowever bourgeois religious leaders should be treated similarly to capitalists. Seize their capital, give them an option of exile or reform. Etc",

It is a reaction against their more reactionary elements. **But** this kind of response is almost always counterproductive, just a cyclic paradox of tolerance where atheists judge whole religions by their worst aspects, said religions feel attacked by atheism (as a whole when it's actually a minority) and react accordingly etc\n\nIt's hard to explain but from an agnostic point of view, hardliner atheists and strict religious types are eerily similar at times despite being ideological opposites",

During the Civil War much of the Church was actively counter-Revolutionary, as would be expected of any part of the semi-feudal state resisting a popular revolution. This gives context to a lot of actions of the Bolsheviks against the Orthodox Church and I agree with parts of their approach. As a part of the reactionary force of Czarist state the Church as it existed in 1917 needed to be dismantled and remodled to protect the new proletarian state. I do think that this was taken too far however and those excesses were a grave mistake. The USSR shouldn't have suppressed individual Christian worshippers or destroyed their places of worship and they certainly shouldn't have extended that suppression to other religions that lacked the widespread state affiliated religious organisations used by the Czars to oppress the people, such as Islam. \n\nOverall it's certainly one of the biggest mistakes but like many of the other great mistakes of the USSR (Such as the mismanagement of the purges) it came from a legitimate reaction to the material conditions of the Soviet Union.",

                "The problem is that religion is often a horrible institution that seeks to build power and oppress people. I understand why socialist governments would be opposed to religious institutions. They conflict with education (ex: evolution vs. creationism), they often push public opinions in favor of detrimental viewpoints (ex: denying rights to women), and in many places all over the world they're at tax free income stream that direct affects markets and politics (ex: catholics in the us). Religious groups often push for wars against \"others\" (ex: The Crusades and jihads). Some religions even physically takeover countries like catholicism in Italy.\n\nNot all religious religious people are bad. Several wonderful things have been done by missionaries and caring groups. But on a macro scale, religions tend toward self empowerment via war, mis/disinformation, and market manipulation.\n\nWho in their right mind can look at religion as a whole and not see the glaring flaws? Of course socialists didn't want all these BS pushed on their people. \n\nDo I agree with Hakim? Sadly, yes, people are spiritual and Faith finds a way.

To take that away is cruel.\n\nHowever the repression of religious institutions functioning as arms of reaction should be suppressed. So it is not a clear-cut issue, since a lot of the religion the Soviets were repressing was the reactionary Russian Orthodox Church. Also, Lenin did not believe in the repression of religion or its practice, but just thought socialists ought to be atheists.\n\nThe biggest reason it was such mistake is because socialist repression of religion caused all the religious institutions to become even more reactionary enemies of socialism, furthering the myth that socialism and religion somehow conflict. It was a disaster that continues with stereotypes about \"evil atheist communist hive minds\" driving the mostly religious proletariat away from the movement for no reason at all!",

Revolutions are an outpouring of human creativity and seek to supplant the entire old foundation on which a country is built. This is noble and not a mistake, but also a uniquely European pursuit. \n\nIt is times like this, socialists should look back on Robespierre. \n\n>\n\n>Citizens, did you want a revolution without a revolution? What is this spirit of persecution that has come to revise, so to speak, the one that broke our chains? But what sure judgement can one make of the effects that can follow these great commotions? Who can mark, after the event, the exact point at which the waves of popular insurrection should break? At that price, what people could ever have shaken off the yoke of despotism? For while it is true that a great nation cannot rise in a simultaneous movement, and that tyranny can only be hit by the portion of citizens that is closest to it, how would these ever dare to attack it if, after the victory, delegates from remote parts could hold them responsible for the duration or violence of the political torment that had saved the homeland? They ought to be regarded as justified by tacit proxy for the whole of society. The French, friends of liberty, meeting in Paris last August, acted in that role, in the name of all the departments. They should either be approved or repudiated entirely. To make them criminally responsible for a few apparent or real disorders, inseparable from so great a shock, would be to punish them for their devotion.\n\nThe failure was of a lack of replacement. The French Revolution pursued cults of reason and alternative festivals, which were popular celebrations of revolutionary achievements. Thereby negating the hold of the church, but since these never reached their full potential, it was only a temporary negation.\n\nBreaking the hold of religion was built into the enlightenment framework Marx drew from and should not be considered applicable to countries outside of Europe. Those socialists will have to decide for themselves how to approach such an issue. Including in the United States were domonionist baptists have a strangle hold on religious conversation. That was the 20th century error, exporting European expectations onto countries which were not European. \n\nAnd I am speaking from the POV of a Gnostic Christian. One of the first proper revolutionary challenges to wealth and power came from the Sethians, who were wiped out in the second century.

While I can understand why past and present socialist states had such strict laws around religion, I generally believe that people should be allowed to believe whatever they want about spiritual matters freely. However that being said, I also think that the reactionary elements of certain religions need to be addressed, particularly if those religions have a large amount of influence and power. While I think people should be allowed to practice whatever religion they want, religious institutions should not wield any sort of state power particularly if said religions have extremely reactionary elements. As someone who lives in America I can personally speak on reactionary religious folks doing extremely damaging things to other people. The oppression of the LGBT+ community and the overturn of Roe v.

Whether or not you're religious, forcibly trying to repress things doesn't often work, as we could see in the early efforts of Stalin against the church. Even if I disagree with someone's religious views (and I do, because I'm an atheist), forcing it isn't the right option; reasonable discourse is. \n\nOn the other hand, religion can and usually is extremely destructive. It often spreads through coercion and war. We are at the point in human history where it is not required to produce sufficient social cohesion required for survival, not like the past. It is primarily determined by your place of birth. It is not rational. It is usually not helpful, and it should be divorced from state completely and education. It has no place in schools except history or mythology classes, and more often than not, it arrests critical thinking. So it's also difficult not to realize why certain states want nothing to do with it and are hostile towards it.",

I may not agree with someone's religious views, but unless we are actively putting the more extreme religious zealots (ie sociopaths like the US Supreme Court)  in the highest positions of power I'm okay with any and all religious practice. As long as we aren't giving all power to the \"religious\", than religion can serve as a comfort to the masses. Just don't try to coerce me to adhere to your religious doctrine. Imma keep actively being kind, trying not to be a dick, help out other people when I can and protest the mistreatment of others like a good little satanist.

When I was in college I spent a year studying in Japan, the mountainside college was close to a temple where I was eventually invited to come meditate once a week. That was before bullshit marketable spirituality got shoved down everyone\u2019s throats on social media.\n\nThe teachings were really simple, it was less about knowing, and more about just doing. It boiled down to \u201cshut the fuck up, sit down and look at the wall\u201d\u2026 and that was it\n\nI never quite understood, untill years later I decided to keep doing what they taught me daily. I was in a bad place and this was my Hail Mary, a shot in the dark to help myself.\n\nAnd it did\u2026 at first I just felt relieved, my troubled just seeped out of me\u2026 but after a while, things started becoming trippy. I started having these visions. As if there was all this information already inside me, and I was finally allowed it to access me. \n\nThere were clearly levels to this\u2026 I just wanted to be in a better place. I didn\u2019t need more, so I took only that and left. \n\nPoint is, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if that could be the case. I myself haven\u2019t tried DMT, so I can\u2019t tell for sure",

Now I grow my cacti and shrooms, and I've drunk yag\u00e9 in the Amazon with the Taita. Luckily the Amazon is close by to me.\n\nAnyway, I highly suggest meditation as a reintegration technique.

            "selftext": "It\u2019s always possible this will not be a controversial thesis, that everyone \u2014 including Christians \u2014 will be like \u201cYeah, obviously\u201d. But growing up as a progressive Christian, I did not really think of Christianity as being especially authoritarian, and I suspect that\u2019s probably true for a lot of other Christians, but that\u2019s also the nature of indoctrination. One of the advantages of deconversion is the ability to look at Christianity with more objectivity, and from that vantage point, it\u2019s clear that Christianity has always been and continues to be very \u2014 I would even say unusually \u2014 authoritarian.\n\nThis, of course, does not mean that there aren\u2019t other religions that are authoritarian, but when compared to the religions at the time Christianity formed, Christianity appears especially authoritarian. Furthermore, at least some other authoritarian religions, like Islam, are actually offshoots of Christianity, inheriting its authoritarian aspects. Furthermore, while there can undoubtedly be sects within any religion that are more authoritarian than others, my argument here is that Christianity is fundamentally authoritarian. \n\nSo likewise, while you may claim that _your_ particular Christian sect is _not_ authoritarian \u2014 and there are certainly sects of Christianity that are less authoritarian \u2014 for the purpose of this debate we should focus on traditional Christianity, as practiced by mainstream Christians for the bulk of the last 2,000 years. I raise three primary classes of examples of the very authoritarian nature of Christianity: authoritarian dogma, terminology, and governance.\n\n\nAuthoritarian Dogma\n----------------------------\n\nChristianity has a much more authoritarian dogma than its parent religion, 1st-century Judaism. By the first century, of course, Jews generally believed that Yahweh was the only God that existed, but in Judaism the relationship between man and God was much less authoritarian.\n\nFor instance, the Israelites were \u201cthe chosen people\u201d not just because Yahweh chose them, but because they voluntarily entered into covenants \u2014 quid pro quo agreements \u2014 with God (e.g. \u201cmake an offering and cut off part of your penises, and I will be your God and give you a lot of descendants and land\u201d). In fact, individual Israelites could still \u201copt out\u201d of this covenant simply by not getting circumcised, although this would also require their expulsion from their community:\n\n_\u201cAny uncircumcised male, who has not been circumcised in the flesh, will be cut off from his people; he has broken my covenant\u201d -- Genesis 17:14_\n\nFive hundred years later, when Yahweh provides Moses with detailed laws that the Israelites must follow \u2014 including the law that they \u201chave no other God before [Yahweh]\u201d \u2014 in order to have God provide victories and protection in the Promised Land, these laws only applied to the Israelites, not to anyone else on the planet. For instance, God didn\u2019t require anyone else to not eat shellfish or pay an annual tax at the temple, just the Israelites.\n\nIn addition, the hundreds of laws God established for the Israelites were \u2014 like the laws governing other religions and civilizations of the time \u2014 focused almost entirely on people\u2019s actions, requiring or proscribing specific actions in specific circumstances (the only exception I\u2019m aware of is the commandment prohibiting coveting, a strong emotion that is likely to lead to prohibited actions like theft and adultery). But these laws did not require or proscribe specific thoughts or beliefs (e.g. \u201chaving other gods before Yahweh\u201d would still be about actions, like erecting idols to or performing sacrifices to those gods).\n\nWith that background, it should now be clear how Christianity is far more authoritarian than its predecessor:\n\n* Christianity requires or proscribes not just actions, but specific thoughts and beliefs. For instance, Yahweh did not require individual Israelites to believe in him, just that they perform the necessary actions \u2014 circumcision, sacrifices, tithing, etc \u2014 to comply with his laws. The extension of requirements and proscriptions into the internal world of people\u2019s thoughts and beliefs \u2014 and the common view that God constantly and omnisciently monitors all of our thoughts and beliefs for transgressions \u2014 makes Christianity far more authoritarian.\n\n* Christianity claims that God\u2019s requirements and proscriptions \u2014 and his judgement of our success or failure at following these \u2014 are universal and apply to all persons, rather than just to the Israelites / Jews. In other words, the scope of God\u2019s expressed \u201cauthority\u201d over mankind is infinitely larger than what existed in 1st-century Judaism.\n\n* Unlike 1st-century Judaism, Christianity states that God\u2019s authority over mankind is nonconsensual. It is not based on mankind agreeing to a covenant with God, in which we are voluntarily placed under his authority in exchange for specific benefits. And unlike the Abrahamic and Mosaic covenants, there is no way for individual people to \u201copt out\u201d and escape from God\u2019s authority.\n\nIn addition, while 1st- and 2nd-century Christianity was characterized by a diversity of beliefs and scriptures, Christians in later centuries eventually mandated an authoritarian approach to both belief and scripture:\n\n* Christians have traditionally used the term \u201cdogma\u201d to describe the required tenets of their faith, a term which means \"a principle or set of principles laid down by an authority as incontrovertibly true\u201d, and any Christian who failed to conform to belief in the dogma established by Christian authoritarians was branded a heretic and traditionally subject to expulsion, punishment, or execution.\n\n* Christian religious authorities also eventually established the Christian canon, the authorized list of the only texts that could be considered as valid scripture, with early Christians destroying scriptures that were not accepted into the canon, especially if they were seen as supporting heretical beliefs.\n\nThe systematic elimination of beliefs and texts and even people that contradicted those authorized by church officials has to be seen as a very authoritarian approach to religion.\n\n\nAuthoritarian Terminology\n----------------------------------\n\nEarly Christians underscored the uniquely authoritarian aspects of their religion by adopting uniquely authoritarian terminology. In fact, this terminology is rooted in the most authoritarian form of human relationship, slavery.\n\nPaul, of course, says that he and other Christians are \u201cslaves\u201d:\n\n_\"But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves of God, the benefit you reap leads to holiness, and the result is eternal life.\u201d -- Romans 6:22_\n\n_\"Obey them not only to win their favor when their eye is on you, but as slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from your heart\u201d -- Ephesians 6:6_\n\nNow, it\u2019s understandable why some Christians \u2014 especially in the 17th-19th centuries \u2014 would want to downplay that Paul is actually saying that Christians are slaves, and so argue that he is saying that they are a form of servant. Other Christians have done an able job refuting this, so I won\u2019t delve into this longstanding debate, except to mention two verses that I think make it especially clear that Paul \u2014 who himself was forcibly converted to Christianity against his will \u2014  believed Christians are actually _chattel_ slaves:\n\n_The one who was free when called is Christ\u2019s slave. You were bought at a price\u201d -- 1 Corinthians 7:22-23_\n\n_You are not your own; you were bought at a price.\u201d -- 1 Corinthians 6:19-20_\n\nFurthermore, the common title that Christians use to refer to Jesus \u2014 \u201cLord\u201d \u2014 comes from the Greek word \u201ckyrios\", but a more straightforward translation would be \u201cmaster\u201d. In ancient Athens, the \u201ckyrios\" was the master \u2014 the authoritarian \u2014 of a Greek household, and more generally meant someone who had control over something or someone . And therefore, just as became true of the English word \u201cmaster\u201d, kyrios was also used specifically as the title of someone who owned slaves, as attested by Paul himself:\n\n_\"Slaves, obey your earthly masters [kyrios] with respect and fear, and with sincerity of heart, just as you would obey Christ\u201d -- Ephesians 6:5_\n\n_\u201dMasters [kyrios], provide your slaves with what is right and fair.\u201d -- Colossians 4:1_\n\nIn fact, Christians effectively refer to Jesus as \u201cmaster Jesus\u201d specifically because they believe he has control \u2014 absolute authority \u2014 over everyone and everything, because that\u2019s what the NT says the resurrected Jesus explicitly claimed:\n\n_\"Then Jesus came to them and said, 'All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me\u2019\u201d -- Matthew 28:18_\n\nThis belief, of course, refutes the idea that Christians are mere servants and not slaves, because Jesus is effectively declaring that he has non-consensual authority over everyone \u2014 not just Christians \u2014 and is free to punish them with \"everlasting destruction\u201d (per Paul) for violations of that authority. In short, \u201cmaster Jesus\u201d is claiming to be the slaveholder of all mankind, whom he \u201cbought for a price\u201d.\n\nThat early Christians essentially viewed Jesus as a slaveholder is reinforced by the fact that a slaveholder must assign overseers to control and direct the slaves, and it turns that was the very term early Christians adopted to refer to church officials who oversaw a church and its members: the English word \u201cbishop\u201d is derived from the Greek word used in the New Testament \u201cep\u00edskopos\u201d, which literally means \u201coverseer\u201d.\n\nAnd as you might expect, one of the jobs of these \u201coverseers\u201d was to act as enforcers, enacting and enforcing authoritarian restrictions on speech and belief:\n\n_\u201d[The overseer] must hold firmly to the trustworthy message as it has been taught, so that he can encourage others by sound doctrine and refute those who oppose it. For there are many rebellious people, full of meaningless talk and deception, especially those of the circumcision group. **They must be silenced**, because they are disrupting whole households by teaching things they ought not to teach\u201d -- Titus 1:9-10_\n\nIn time, as these Christian overseers grew more and more powerful \u2014 and especially once Christianity was established as the state religion of the Roman Empire in the late 4th century \u2014 they would authorize violence against Christian heretics and non-Christians alike; by the early 5th century, heresy against Christian dogma warranted the death penalty in the Roman Empire. Ironically, this very authoritarian approach to belief would ultimately result in vast wars between groups of Christians simply because they had unique authority structures and (therefore) conflicting dogma.\n\n\nAuthoritarian Governance\n----------------------------------\n\nIn the third- and fourth-centuries, a strict power hierarchy emerged in the Christian church. Broadly, this hierarchy declared that Christ had authority over the church, and the church had authority over its lay members, at least in matters of religion. Additional layers of hierarchy also existed and still exist within the churches of most sects of Christianity, typically forming a pyramidal hierarchy, in which a patriarch has authority over the entire sect, a small group of bishops have authority over a subset, and and a larger group of priests or ministers or deacons have authority over specific churches and their members.\n\nFurthermore, historically, Christianity insisted that this authoritarian pyramid extended beyond the church into the laity, with husbands having absolute authority over their wives, and children being absolutely submissive to all adults. [NOTE: One can easily see how such an absolute authoritarian hierarchy easily leads to abuse, such as pedophile priests and ministers exercising their religious authority to molest children, and authoritarian church leaders suppressing accusations of such abuse].\n\nBut what made this authoritarian pyramid especially effective for Christianity is that, unlike Judaism with its hundreds of fairly specific and well-defined religious laws encoded in the Pentateuch, neither Jesus nor the New Testament provided a detailed list of the religious requirements and proscriptions that Christians must follow. Even worse, Jesus and the NT left the status of compliance with Jewish law fuzzy, with Christians being required to continue to follow a poorly-defined set of certain Jewish laws, but being able to ignore another poorly-defined set of other Jewish laws.\n\nAs a result of this ambiguity, in Christianity, it has always been the authoritarian leaders of the Christian church who have decided what religious laws the Christians they have authority over must obey, and there was nothing preventing these leaders from mandating religious laws that crept into every area of daily life. Christian authorities have long imposed restrictions on the financial obligations of Christians, on how Christians can dress, what entertainments Christians can engage in, etc.\n\nAnd of course, the authoritarian leaders of Christianity gained a massive amount of power at the end of the fourth century, when it was adopted as the state religion of the flagging Roman Empire, setting a precedent that would largely continue throughout western Europe for the next fifteen hundred years. In this arrangement, Christian authoritarian leades provided support for civil authoritarians (emperors, kings, governors, etc) by declaring that those civil authoritarians were put in their positions by God, and that God required Christians to submit to the edicts of these civil authorities. \n\nIn turn, the civil authorities supported the religious authority of the state religions, by assisting in funding the state religion and by authorizing or condoning the persecution of non-believers and trying and executing religious heretics. While exceptions were sometimes made for certain minority religions \u2014 such as Judaism \u2014 the end result was that for much of the last 1500 years, practically everyone residing in a political state of western Europe was at least nominally a Christian, and as such under the authority of a sect of the Christian church and its leaders. The result was a longstanding Christian authoritarianism that controlled the lives of everyone in western Europe.\n\nAnd even when mankind began to overthrow the tyranny of state religious authoritarians and the civil authoritarians they supported \u2014 even as countries like the United States were formed to expressly prohibit the creation of a state religion \u2014 the authoritarian impulse of Christianity never went away. The United States has a long and sordid history of elected Christian legislators or appointed civil servants enacting laws and regulations intended to persecute religious minorities and impose Christian religious morality and practice, such as the banning of \u201cimmoral\u201d books and movies and liquor, or the regulation of entertainment and commercial activities on Sundays (aka \u201cblue laws\u201d).\n\nToday, the authoritarian impulse of Christianity not only continues, but has exceeded all bounds. In the first- and second-centuries, Christian authoritarians only had authority over those who voluntarily submitted to them. But today, Christian authoritarians insist that they should be able to use civil government to legally impose their religious morality and beliefs on everyone, Christian and non-Christian alike, even in countries like the U.S. without state religions.\n\nFurthermore, the Christian laity themselves in the U.S.  generally support this authoritarian impulse, the use of civil government to create laws that enforce Christian morality and encourage Christian beliefs. In 2020, [Pew reported](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2020/04/13/half-of-americans-say-bible-should-influence-u-s-laws-including-28-who-favor-it-over-the-will-of-the-people/) that 76% of Protestants and 51% of Catholics said that the laws of the United States \u2014 which apply to Christians and non-Christians alike \u2014 should be influenced by the Christian Bible. Even more disturbing, Pew reported that 51% of Protestants and 25% of Catholics favor basing laws on the Bible over the will of the people.\n\nAnd so it\u2019s not surprising that US politics continues to be dominated by the Christian authoritarian impulse even to this day, with constant attempts by Christian authoritarians to encode into law their view of what Christian morality and belief requires, using civil government to extend the authority of the Christian church onto everyone, including both dissenting Christians and non-Christians. It doesn\u2019t get much more authoritarian that that.\n\nExcept when it does. There are large numbers of Christian Nationalists who want to roll back the clock and official make the U.S. a Christian nation whose laws are dictated by Christian authoritarians. Amazingly, [Pew reports](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2022/10/27/45-of-americans-say-u-s-should-be-a-christian-nation/) that only 54% of Americans affirmatively state they believe the federal government should require the separation of church and state.\n\nThis is an outgrowth of the fundamentally authoritarian nature of Christianity and its very authoritarian dogma, terminology, and governance.",

                "Islam is not an offshoot of Christianity and the pagan religions were not filled with doctrine, but irreverence towards the gods and atheism were still not tolerated. The Roman imperial cult also became increasingly authoritarian along with the office itself as the crisis of the Empire deepened. I grant the point that all religions are authoritarian to a point, but Christianity is among the least authoritarian. French philosopher Paul Ricoeur called Christianity the religion that allows people to leave religion. I don\u2019t think it is a coincidence that Enlightenment\u2019s geographic spread is near identical to that of Christianity. Christianity sowed the seed from which it grew. Christianity also has a concept of separation of religious and political power that enables this (\u2018give to God what is God\u2019s and to Caesar what is Caesar\u2019s\u2019)\n\nTry criticising Christianity in public in a majority Christian area, do the same in a majority Muslim area and see for yourself which response is the most authoritarian.",
                "Every power in control is authoritarian by nature. Judaism is authoritarian because it requires the worship of one God. Worship other God\u2019s and you could see destruction. In fact this happens in 2 Kings:\n\n\u201cManasseh was twelve years old when he became king, and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother\u2019s name was Hephzibah. And he did evil in the sight of the Lord, according to the abominations of the nations whom the Lord had cast out before the children of Israel. For he rebuilt the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed; he raised up altars for Baal, and made a wooden image, as Ahab king of Israel had done; and he worshiped all the host of heaven and served them. He also built altars in the house of the Lord, of which the Lord had said, \u201cIn Jerusalem I will put My name.\u201d And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the Lord. Also he made his son pass through the fire, practiced soothsaying, used witchcraft, and consulted spiritists and mediums. He did much evil in the sight of the Lord, to provoke Him to anger. He even set a carved image of Asherah that he had made, in the house of which the Lord had said to David and to Solomon his son, \u201cIn this house and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will put My name forever; and I will not make the feet of Israel wander anymore from the land which I gave their fathers\u2014only if they are careful to do according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all the law that My servant Moses commanded them.\u201d But they paid no attention, and Manasseh seduced them to do more evil than the nations whom the Lord had destroyed before the children of Israel. \u201cBecause Manasseh king of Judah has done these abominations (he has acted more wickedly than all the Amorites who were before him, and has also made Judah sin with his idols), therefore thus says the Lord God of Israel: \u2018Behold, I am bringing such calamity upon Jerusalem and Judah, that whoever hears of it, both his ears will tingle. And I will stretch over Jerusalem the measuring line of Samaria and the plummet of the house of Ahab; I will wipe Jerusalem as one wipes a dish, wiping it and turning it upside down. So I will forsake the remnant of My inheritance and deliver them into the hand of their enemies; and they shall become victims of plunder to all their enemies, because they have done evil in My sight, and have provoked Me to anger since the day their fathers came out of Egypt, even to this day.\u2019 \u201d\u201d\n\u202d\u202dII Kings\u202c \u202d21\u202c:\u202d1\u202c-\u202d9\u202c, \u202d11\u202c-\u202d15\u202c \u202dNKJV\u202c\u202c\n\nIt is not \u201coptional\u201d to worship God or Yahweh in the Old Testament. Its all the same. Christianity if anything provides a freedom of the law. \n\nA slice of Romans 5 explains how this new system is significantly more lenient:\n\n\u201cTherefore, as through one man\u2019s offense judgment came to all men, resulting in condemnation, even so through one Man\u2019s righteous act the free gift came to all men, resulting in justification of life. For as by one man\u2019s disobedience many were made sinners, so also by one Man\u2019s obedience many will be made righteous. Moreover the law entered that the offense might abound. But where sin abounded, grace abounded much more, so that as sin reigned in death, even so grace might reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.\u201d\n\u202d\u202dRomans\u202c \u202d5\u202c:\u202d18\u202c-\u202d21\u202c \u202dNKJV\u202c\u202c\n\nPaul even goes further to explain that while this looks like an excuse to not follow any laws or anything, the outcome is a submission to it:\n\n\u201cWhat shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound? Certainly not! How shall we who died to sin live any longer in it? Or do you not know that as many of us as were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into His death? Therefore we were buried with Him through baptism into death, that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.\u201d\n\u202d\u202dRomans\u202c \u202d6\u202c:\u202d1\u202c-\u202d4\u202c \u202dNKJV\u202c\u202c\n\nIt is still authoritarian albeit less than traditional Judaism.

                "There's a lot to go after there, but, sticking to the thesis, I think this may be a \"missing the forest for the trees\" scenario.\n\nChristianity, as ideology, is subject to the same forces as every other ideology, namely puritanism (not the religious sect, but the seeking of purity), abuse (creation of ideologues), and, apropos the first two, susceptibility to corruption when mixed with power. \n\nBy your analysis, you miss the historical events that created the major differences between these religions we see today. For example, early Christianity had a political science problem: coordination. They had lots of different sects popping up with new and varying claims, all slight (or major) variations on the idea of the day, Christianity. In an effort to define themselves (primarily against Judaism), they began doing exactly what you've suggested: moderate which books are \"in\", what's the \"right\" dogma, etc. In so doing, they were better able to protect themselves from being absorbed by other faiths or so separated that there would be no such thing as \"Christianity.\" On the other hand, in the time of the Prophet, Islam had no issue. Of course, after his death, Islam has had some issues and broke into a few sects. Those disputes, though, came after significant upbuilding of the faith. Furthermore, Judaism has been rather homogenous as they lacked numbers historically. The story of the Hebrew Bible is essentially, this small group of people called Israelites are God's people and they'll stay small and often be conquered, but they're still Jews and still God's people. \n\nPerhaps the biggest \"sin\" contributing to your thesis is Constantinianism, which is when the early Christian faith was given a Faustian bargain of sorts where they could stop being persecuted and find an inordinate amount of power and influence simultaneously - and they took it. \n\nI guess what I'm saying here is that you're correct, but under two critical caveats:\n\n1. Not entirely because of the reasons you've given or because Christianity is somehow more theologically or ideologically susceptible than other ideas to authoritarianism, but because the events that led to the today's Christianity, as you've defined it, created situations wherein it became more authoritarian.\n2. And, more importantly, Christianity, as you've defined it, is really more Christian Nationalism, or Christianity mixed heavily with state power. For example, your statement about \"your Christianity versus traditional Christianity\" isn't as easy to parse out as you might think. For during that same 2,000 years you're saying this covers, plenty of Christians fought against the maintenance of power that is the Christianity you're describing. Regardless of the specifics, the very fact that Christianity can be both what you say and [this](https://www.christiansagainstchristiannationalism.org) undercuts your argument of authoritarianism. The division instead suggests that some ideas about Christianity are authoritarian, which can also be said about things as big as both major American political parties or as small and insignificant as people with [strong opinions](https://www.quora.com/Why-cant-people-let-others-enjoy-pineapple-on-pizza-Last-time-I-checked-I-wasnt-hurting-anyone) on pineapples and pizza.",

                "Christianity has both \"authoritarian\" (relative to what a liberal might like) and anti-authoritarian (relative to what a legalist might like) elements, perfecting both the authoritarian and the anti-authoritarian tendency at once while correcting for their failures (i.e., graceless tyranny on the one hand and chaotic nihilism on the other). Obviously, when you present as slanted a picture as you do, you're not going to have a very good understanding of it.\n\n**Dogma**  \nCentral to the Christian take on law is the re-centering the purpose of the law from mindless obedience enforced by extrinsic sanctions to the improvement of the underlying human spiritual condition: \"The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.\" (Mark 2:27). This is why Jesus required not just outward obedience (which is the chief preoccupation of authoritarians), but inward conversion toward what is truly good for the person, a conversion that cannot be achieved merely by means of sanctions, but primarily by the action of conscience. Jesus understands that the human improvement at which all law ought to aim does not come from external conditioning per se, but from inward conversion, and once that transformation is effected, both the excesses and deficiencies of law are rectified. Jesus recognises that the law is a blunt instrument, having to make allowances for evil (hence insufficiently exhorting people toward the good) (Matthew 19:8), and at the same time, sometimes acting in spiritually counterproductive ways (when sanctions are pursued for their own sake, rather than as a means of love of God and neighbour). Hence, for instance, he could rebuke the mob who sought to impose an extreme sanction on the adulterous woman, and at the same time say to the same woman, \"God, and sin no more.\" Christianity as a result refocuses away from the kinds of external signs that authority can impose (the ritual and dietary requirements of the law, which do have an underlying spiritual purpose that is fulfilled and thereby done away with)\n\nIt is this recognition of the limits of law which is at the root of individual freedom's just claims against law. It is primarily a Christian innovation to distinguish the spiritual kingdom from the temporal, and to see them as pursuing fundamentally different aims, and where they clash, the spiritual is higher. It is precisely because salvation, the highest spiritual occupation of any one, must ultimately be a matter of the individual's free relation to God, that the reconciliation of our individual subjectivity to the good apart from external imposition is dignified with the sacredness it subsequently acquires in Christian and post-Christian culture. The de-emphasis on law as the motivation at the core of the Christian life, replaced with the virtues like faith, hope and love, which is a recurring theme through the Epistles of Paul, is a main doctrinal feature of Christianity. This doesn't mean that all standards are abolished, but that the reason for complying is no longer coercion, but the manifestation of an inward transformation of the will. \n\nAt the same time, Christianity recognises that it is not only apparently external forces that exercise tyranny. Conscience is not able to function as conscience unless it finds a true and stable anchor for its judgements, and there is no shortage of false and unstable anchors for those judgements. Someone without conscience would be tyrannised by his own mindless passions, to his own detriment. Hence, Christianity rightly recognises that to be free is not merely a negative matter (i.e., negating that which takes away freedom). Freedom has a positive requirement of a sound and true understanding of what it is for human beings as such to flourish. \n\nThe universality of God's authority is the universality of truth and goodness, and the universality of truth and goodness is the precondition of any intelligible norm of freedom. After all, if there is no universal law that mediates between the tyrant and the tyrannised, then there is no justice by which to condemn the tyrant for violating the freedom of his victims, to which his victims can intelligibly appeal. In places which lack such a concept of transcendent authority, there is no conceptual bulwark against the tyranny of whatever group or individual happens to be in power (certainly, the presence of the idea of transcendent authority can also be abused to reinforce unjust power relations, but the idea is much less useful to those who already have all authority on their side, and those who have none but Heaven). In Judaism, this is precisely the use of the universal law of God against the petty tyrannies of rulers and human beings. The Christian expansion of God's universal authority to the world extends this liberation to all. Little wonder, then, that those who object to the universality of God's authority must erect a universal authority of their own in his place in pale imitation of him (basically every liberal's attempt to erect systems of universal rights without God), or devolve into mere antinomians with no stable or useful concept of flourishing, or, as happens quite frequently, both.  \n\n\n**Terminology**\n\nIt's no surprise that Christianity appropriates the language of slavery and mastery to new ends. It does so with all sorts of other foundational concepts, like law, sacrifice, wisdom, foolishness, life, and death. For the Christian to be a slave of God is to be freer than everyone else, since the Christian is then subject to nothing but that which improves and perfects him and helps him overcome death. To be a Christian \"master\" of a Christian \"slave,\" and vice versa, is to be bound together in love, which demands even more perfect service than slavery can provide, but is motivated and ruled by the superior law which coercion cannot in principle supply, i.e., love. To have been redeemed by Christ and to be reminded of the price, is to be reminded of whose life the Christian lives: not his own mortal, destructible life, but Christ's immortal and indestructible one which Christ made possible through his atoning death. In invoking the image of chattel slavery, the Apostle deliberately modifies and redirects the unpleasant imagery to new ends, just as Jesus changed the significance of the Cross: The price Jesus paid has given the Christian's former \"owners\" (including his own sinful, finite self) that which they were due, i.e., death (Romans 6:23), and has made possible a new relation that infinitely elevates and enables them rather than denigrates and restricts them. Christianity does not support terminology that makes us into absolute self-rulers, because that would be precisely to give us over to the kind of tyranny from which Christianity saves us. \n\nOf course your account does not mention the *other* great theme in the New Testament describing the status of Christians, which is to be \"co-heirs\" with Christ (e.g., Romans 8:17), who are, though analogous to slaves in that they are completely subject to God's will, also disanalogous to slaves in that they are God's adopted children, subject perfectly to God precisely because they are able to perfectly share in all that God is and has. It is precisely as God's adopted children that we have liberties not to follow elements of the old law, and these are privileges that Paul famously and jealously guarded.",

                ">Furthermore, the Christian laity themselves in the U.S. generally support this authoritarian impulse, the use of civil government to create laws that enforce Christian morality and encourage Christian beliefs. In 2020, Pew reported that 76% of Protestants and 51% of Catholics said that the laws of the United States \u2014 which apply to Christians and non-Christians alike \u2014 should be influenced by the Christian Bible. Even more disturbing, Pew reported that 51% of Protestants and 25% of Catholics favor basing laws on the Bible over the will of the people.\n\nPractically every religion, ideology, and belief system seeks to implement laws that are in line with their views of morality and virtue. All of politics is people forcing their views upon other people. Atheists do this just as much as everybody else. In order to maintain that Christians seeking laws to reflect their view of the world is authoritarian, you would have to agree that all political decision-making and all government is authoritarian. Would you consider Christian emperors banning infanticide and child abandonment to be authoritarian imposition of morals? Was Christian kings forbidding human sacrifice and ritual cannibalism an authoritarian imposition of morals?\n\n>In the third- and fourth-centuries, a strict power hierarchy emerged in the Christian church.

Companies have presidents and CEO's who are above the trustees and workers. Non profits also have officers and boards that are above the other members. Sports leagues have commissioners who are above others. All governments have hierarchies as well with presidents, prime ministers, commissioners, secretaries, ministers, etc. Families have hierarchies as well, with parents holding significantly more power than their children. Hierarchies are a fact of life, and are not an indication of authoritarianism, unless one views all forms of hierarchy as oppressive. The Catholic Church and most Protestant Churches are hierarchical, but not authoritarian, as power and authority are dispersed. Priests have authority over their immediate congregation or parish (some protestant churches have elected elders for each congregation). Their power is not absolute, as they answer to the Bishop, who is head of a diocese, which is a collection of churches/parishes. His authority is not absolute either, as Bishops have to answer to the Pope or to a larger governing body, which is often seen in Protestantism, in which Bishops are members of legislative bodies.\n\n>Furthermore, historically, Christianity insisted that this authoritarian pyramid extended beyond the church into the laity, with husbands having absolute authority over their wives, and children being absolutely submissive to all adults. \\[NOTE: One can easily see how such an absolute authoritarian hierarchy easily leads to abuse, such as pedophile priests and ministers exercising their religious authority to molest children, and authoritarian church leaders suppressing accusations of such abuse\\].\n\nHusbands do not have absolute authority over their wives, nor are children absolutely submissive to their parents. This is not and never was a doctrine of the Church. Wives are called to submit to their husbands, but they do not have to listen to their husband if he wishes them to do something immoral and contrary to the scriptures or teachings of the Church. Furthermore, the husband has the responsibility of caring for his wife and loving her. A husband is to be faithful and loyal to his wife and look out for the best interests of the family. The husband should be thought of more as the loving leader of a family than as a ruler. Furthermore, this objection to Christianity seems strange considering that fact that more converts to the Church were woman. Why would women convert to a religion in which the husband supposedly has authoritarian control over her? Perhaps it is because Christianity commands husbands to love love their wives in such as manner as Christ loved the Church and to love their wives as their self. Perhaps women converted to Christianity in large numbers because it commanded husbands to love in a sacrificial way. Perhaps it is because husbands were commanded to respect their wives. Perhaps women joined Christianity because they liked a religion that opposed infanticide in a time when baby girls were especially subject to infanticide.\n\n>And of course, the authoritarian leaders of Christianity gained a massive amount of power at the end of the fourth century, when it was adopted as the state religion of the flagging Roman Empire, setting a precedent that would largely continue throughout western Europe for the next fifteen hundred years.

As people converted to Christianity, and as the religion became predominant in Europe, one would expect rulers who were Christian to promote and enforce a Christian understanding of the world. The fact that it was done through a monarchy or through emperors is irrelevant, as that was the world Christianity entered into, not one it created. Christianity being promoted and enforced by kings is not evidence that Christianity is authoritarian. Instead, it is the predictable result of Christianity growing in an authoritarian society. Commonly not mentioned is that throughout much of the Middle Ages, there was a large amount of conflict between monarchs and the Church over who held rightful authority, which is a major reason Europe was decentralized for so long. It was only after that decrease in Church power that strong centralized states were able to form."

Reddit does not have any policy of discriminating against it and I don't think there is any problem of discriminating against it.\n\nThere are plenty of conservative religious subreddits they can go to on Reddit that can remove posts and ban users that they feel are disrespectful or argumentative towards their faith like r/Catholicism, r/OrthodoxChristianity, r/Islam, and r/Christianity",

Those friends of yours are going through something internally, a struggle that won\u2019t ever be understood by some Muslims. It\u2019s a hard and difficult fight because we are fighting with ourselves, our desires and hearts against what we know in our brains are correct. \n\nMake duaa for us struggling and trying our best. We all sin- like you said. Just because people sin differently than you do, doesn\u2019t make them any less \u201creligious\u201d than you. \n\nIdk, this isn\u2019t towards you in particular as I don\u2019t know you nor how you really are as an individual. But, in my opinion, if you\u2019re looking friends that are at your level of religion, there are other ways into wording that and not make it seem like you\u2019re trying to boost the ego or show off. Which I\u2019m sure you aren\u2019t, because like I said- I don\u2019t know you. \n\nAnd the final piece of advice I\u2019ve got is- if it\u2019s that bad, then surround yourself with other people. Mosques generally are empty because other people work, they have families and they have stuff that prevents them from going to a mosque everyday, 5 times a day at fixed times. \n\nPraying in a mosque or praying at home doesn\u2019t make you better than others lol. Sure it gives one hasanat! Yes of course! But it doesn\u2019t give one the right to go around and give themselves the title of \u201c woke religious person\u201d. \n\nI\u2019m glad they try their best during jumuah. \n\nMay Allah guide us all, forgive us and may he ease the internal struggle we all face.

Show up to random prayers and see who's usually at the mosque, even if it's not every prayer. I personally know a lot of Muslims who pray 5x a day, even at the mosque, and have done so for decades. One of them cheated on his wife even, so don't assume just because they're praying all the time, they're all sinless.\n\nAlso, one thing you may not understand fully is that born-Muslims have gone through a LOT of trauma in the West, esp. those who lived through 9/11. It has led to an identity crisis for many of us as we developed a double consciousness (around being American and being Muslim). After 9/11, for example, I was made fun of and told to screw a goat, go back to Iraq etc. etc. I'm sure you've already faced some Islamophobia in the last 5 years, but for those who've been enduring it for decades, they MIGHT just try to assimilate to avoid standing out. I'm not justifying it, but we just don't know what each person is going through, and just because some of us are born Muslim doesn't mean we're going to be good examples for the reverts who might be expecting some better examples. Ultimately, each of us walks our own path, but Allah will reward you for your efforts. Do not give up ever!",

            "selftext": "***EDIT: This post is only applicable to Christianity and Islam\n\n\nArmin Navabi is the creator of Atheist Republic. One time, he talked about his experiences growing up Muslim in Iran.\n\nHe gave a story about how when he was a child, he was so afraid of sinning and going to hell. He realized when he was 10 that if he were to kill himself while he was young he would still be considered innocent by Islam and be allowed into heaven. \n\nHe proceeded to jump off of a building in a suicide attempt.\n\nWhen he woke up in the hospital, his legs broken, he realized his mistake and apologized to his grief stricken parents.\n\nPoint being, this is one of many examples I've seen of people so terrified of committing a sin or of spiritual evil haunting them that it drives them to madness.\n\nI've seen Christian women in 12 step programs because they want to give up masturbating.\n\nI've seen lesbians and gay men living in total abstinence terrified, self hating, and alone because they want to appease God and their families and not live their truth.\n\nFor me personally, when I was a Christian back when I was a kid I was so afraid of Satan and demons that I used to wear crosses everywhere I go and carry a seal of Archangel Michael in my back pocket. I thought the circle stain in the center of my pool was demonic. I used to be terrified of going to sleep at night thinking I would be possessed by something or haunted.\n\nAs I grew up, I realized alot of the supernatural terror I experienced wasn't demons... But sleep paralysis, my unconscious mind, and superstition.\n\nBut I had psychotic levels of terror over any demonic influence in my life when I was a kid. Mostly in part to my Catholic upbringing and a wild imagination.\n\nI would even go so far as to bow at every cross, say 10 our fathers every night, and never do any thing in intervals of 6 and only 7, 8, or 10. Because those are godly numbers.\n\nMy fixation on demonic attacks and angelic protection catapulted me into the occult at a young age. It wasn't until I was an edgy adult teenager that I actually started legitimately dabbling in evocation magic and actual ritual occult stuff. \n\nThat utterly changed my perception of the supernatural and was a necessary step in overriding the paradigm of fear Catholicism instilled in me.\n\nI'm more of a buddhist nowadays and stepped away from western beliefs entirely from my desire to not be associated with it either in opposition or as a part of the religion.\n\nMy biggest reason for leaving Christianity was how much it influenced me to be so utterly afraid of my own thoughts, feelings, emotions, and experiences.\n\nI am more mentally healthy and emotionally stable at this point in my life than any point during when I was a Christian. I believe Christianity facilitated mental illness for me and amplified any existing ones that I had.\n\nI see this in a large percentage of devout Christians that I've interacted with. As well as that, cruelty from those who they fear may break them away from their belief system.\n\nI genuinely cannot see why people claim it's something that helps people. I can only ever see it making people worse off in almost every situation outside of drug addiction in SOME situations.\n\nIt made my depression, anxiety, and life innumerably worse. In part due to the philosophies, also due to the community regarding Christians.\n\nI'm also bisexual and transgender, so I see alot of people comparing LGBT issues to indoctrination and making people suffer and commit suicide. But honestly, my life's never been better and I've never suffered more in this life than when I was a Christian.\n\nI turned away from Christianity before I even realized I was bi or trans. But I do feel like I would have come to terms with it sooner if not for my very religious upbringing.\n\nI want to know your opinion on this, how have you seen Christianity improve people's lives? Because all I can see is it creating more suffering.",

                "It all depends on the version of religion you are given. I grew up essentially around Universalist Christians. They believed that regardless of what you had done, you were eventually going to get to heaven. Hell is more a purging and cleansing of the soul rather than eternal conscious torment. They also believed that Heaven and Hell were more like states as a result of the proximity to God rather than places. I.e. if you were a good person, being in God\u2019s divine presence was serene and peaceful, where if you were incredibly shitty, it felt like, well, hell to be in his presence. Regardless of sects and scholars, everyone in every religion will have different interpretations on things and degrees of religiousness. No one will ever agree on anything. But I would implore you to also read about the damage atheists have done to people as well. Cases in point: The USSR and Communist China. They were quite notorious for their treatment of the religious.",
                "As another (ex Muslim)Iranian, imo it's all a matter of which \"version\" you're taught growing up.\n\nIn my case it was very much the \"as long as you're doing good and not bad\" type of deal(for a general idea read about the story of Moses and the Shepard).\n\nFor quite a few other people it's matter of self discovery, and for some people it's just about fire and brimstone and denying themselves any pleasure out of fear.\n\nIt changes with people and imo most abrahamic religions have so much variation you can't pin down more than a few(compared to the many many different ones)of their shared principles, abrahamic or not.\n\nEdit: even the fire and brimstone thing isn't consistent, there are some Muslims who think the \"fires of hell\" are metaphorical fires, as in a person burns from the shame and weight of their sins in hell, to say nothing of other abrahamic religions.",

Confirmation bias is the normal human bias towards seeing what they think they will see.  \n\nYou had an unusual level of fear, due to the specific details of your upbringing and a wild imagination.  And you're looking at Christianity through this lens, and you see obsession with demons and unusual levels of fear.  \n\nThe Bible does not say \"have an unusual level of fear\".  There is a verse that says \"perfect love casts out fear\", and the most common thing angels say to humans is \"do not be afraid\".  \n\n> I want to know your opinion on this, how have you seen Christianity improve people's lives?\n\nHistorically speaking, hospitals were invented by Christians, and the idea of abolishing slavery came from Christians who had been reading the book of Philemon.  \n\nPersonally speaking, since I have started coming back to the Christianity I grew up in, I have noticed myself acting more morally, and I am significantly less likely to treat other people badly when I am in conflict with them.",

                "The examples you point out are extreme and not as frequent as you seem to believe. Study after study shows that religious people are happier than non-religious people. \n\nAnd I have to wonder if the fearful people you describe would have just fixated their fear on something else if they hadn\u2019t been religious.

They aren't teaching children about demons and exorcisms and being taken over by demons blah blah.\n\nThey teach the lessons of Christ himself, almost every week, and they are basically never teaching anything else to children.\n\nYou were taught poorly, but most people aren't.",
                "First, I want to say I'm sorry to hear about your experience.  I'm glad to hear you're well now.  When you've gone through something that strong, it can be hard to view things in any other light.  I run into the same thing when I hear women who have been abused by men talk about their experiences.  But I think we have good reason to believe you're an outlier.\n\nFear has consequences.  Just look up any article on what anxiety does to a person.  People are less happy, have more relationship problems, and more health problems.  I bring this up because if you're right, we should be able to *measure* the increased fear by measuring happiness, relationships, and health.\n\nAnd when we look at the science, we see that religion does seem to affect people in these areas - but it makes them [happier](https://clinmedjournals.org/articles/ijda/international-journal-of-depression-and-anxiety-ijda-2-016.php?jid=ijda), with better [connections](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3511329?seq=1), and better [health](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3671693/).   This is the *opposite* of what we would expect to see if religion was increasing fear among its followers.  Now, I know that hearing that can feel invalidating - like I'm saying you weren't actually hurting, or something.  That's not what I think.  I just want you consider the idea that maybe religion simply works differently for others than it has for you.  Certainly, that's what I see in the measurements we can make.",
                "I take it a small minority of redditors might not believe the following premises but run with me.  IF there's a God who is good, who has a plan for the world who loves us. If there is eternal paradise on offer then I would say that can help create the opposite. If there is a plan to fix the world, where there will be no more pain, suffering, where they will be peace and love and goodness and flourishing then that's a beautiful hope to cling to.   \nNo more abuse, no more hate, no more division.  It means that while there is pain, confusion and division in this world, there is a God who loves them and understands them in the midst of all this.   \n\n\nLooking specifically at Jesus, he was born into a humble working class family with a complicated family background. He was ostracized, rejected, abusted, deserted. Went through anguish, temptation, dispair, suffering. He is a model but more than a model of one who embodies and understands pain.  If it is true  that he really did rise again then it means there is hope beyond this life. If eternity is real then that can have real power to our   \n\n\nPractically he provides a challenging ethic that has drastically shaped the west. You can read secular agnostic [Historians like Tom Holland](https://www.amazon.com.au/Revolutionary-T-Holland/dp/0281083339) or [Rodney Stark](https://www.amazon.com.au/Rise-Christianity-Rodney-Stark/dp/0060677015) on this.  The idea of servant sacrificial leadership. Dignity and human rights. \n\nI'm sorry for your experience it does sound awful and terrifying.  And absolutely the church, and Islam has as lot to answer for. But your experience of the church  while seemingly is different to the truth claim about whether God is real, whether Jesus is who the bible claims he is.   \n\n\nThe people whom Jesus was more critical of were the religious teachers and rulers. He was most gracious and kind to those on the margins, foreigners, the disabled, the poor, those who  did not fit the conventions of living a good moral life.    \n\n\nThe church is the most diverse global community. Could it, should it be better, absolutely. But it does offer something for hundreds of millions of people.",
                "As a Christian, I think that this is a massive misunderstanding of at least Christianity. The whole point of it is that we don't have to be perfect even in our failure because Jesus died to make us clean, our goodness could never get us to heaven because we all sin, that's why Jesus died. Because of that we also don't need to be scared of demons etc. God is way more powerful than any demon and because of that we should never be scared. Jesus is with us and he protects us. All of this is coming from a Baptist point of view, however I think that the majority of the reformed protestant church would agree wth me in saying this. Something to keep in mind is that  Catholics do have a different idea of salvation whereas you are saved by grace, works and confession so I can see where you're coming from.\n\nI'm sorry that Christians have let you down, they have for me too, but that is why I always say that the biggest problem with Christianity is the Christians. We mess up but that isn't God's fault. Also on the contrary to you since I started taking Christianity seriously my mental health has been a lot better.\n\nDon't get me wrong here but it does sound as though the specific environment you were brought up in was very much an extreme, and I don't think it should speak for Christianity a whole, but I can absolutely see where you're coming from. \n\nThat's just my take though.",
                "&#x200B;\n\nIn the Abrahamic tradition, the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom.  The man who does not fear the moral consequences of his actions is the fool described in the Psalms.\n\nIf you are a slave striving against an unreasonable master, fear is to be avoided.  If you are striving in the  same direction as your guidelines, fear is sometimes an additional stimulant and motivator.  It does not imply  your life takes on a quality of fear.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI took my mother to church this morning where they announced her 91st birthday.  Everyone knows her.  She had dozens of hugs and brief intimate conversations with her friends, each of whom is special to her in a different way.   Until five years ago, she and my late father were still organizing outings \"for the old folks.\"   She lives alone now, but is not lonely and feels her life is very rich.  So do many other people in that congregation.   \n\nThis was an ordinary Presbyterian church near Norfolk, Virginia.  There are thousands of churches like this in the US.",
                "I'm a deist, so I do not have a dog in the fight. However, let's take christianity, specifically Catholicism, as this seems to be the abrahamic religion we are both most familiar with.\n\nLooking at it objectively, it is incredibly easy to get into heaven by that system of belief. All you have to do is not die in a state of mortal sin. Meaning that no matter how many mistakes you make in your life, you are able to enter a realm of eternal bliss simply by sincerely repenting of them. If you also subscribe to C.S. Lewis's interpretation of purgatory, which is controversial, you would even believe that repentance is possible any time after death, turning hell into purgatory.\n\n It is very calming and joyful to know that God loves you and wants, more than anything in the world, for you to prosper.\n\nThe problems you describe fall under scrupulosity, and stem from not believing deeply enough in God's love. It is relatively common, but the church is busy implementing counselling resources in order to assist with it.",

I have to say, a lot of what you're saying resonates with me -- but I don't think it's anything fundamental to Christianity per se, so much as the current expression of the religion.",
                "If we are talking of net benefits of fear have you ever considered the polish case? Throughout soviet oppression , the church which was banned in most places could not be banned in poland due to polish people rebelling at attempts to ban Christianity. The church kept polish culture and polish people together throughout the soviet era and gave them hope. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong but in some of the Russian republics such as Dagestan etc the soviets were unable to ban Islam for the same reason. Obviously religion has the clear potential to scar people and leave room for abuse but it also has had the role of giving hope in peoples lives",
                "Since you mentioned that you were once Catholic, I'll address this through the lens of Catholicism. I don't want to speak for Islam or other denominations.\n\nYou view the world in a completely different way than a devout Catholic does. A devout Catholic isn't playing for comfort in this world. They're playing for the next one. A devout Catholic won't suspend their faith in Church teachings for the sake of not feeling bad or not making others feel bad. A devout Catholic views suffering as a way of uniting with Jesus on the cross. There's a belief in penance.\n\nAs for fear when it comes to Catholicism, there are two types. There is the fear of demons and the fear of hell. The Church teaches that if you live in a state of grace and receive the sacraments, you have no need to fear demons. Demons can't touch you, and if anything, *they* should be the ones who are afraid. As for fear of hell, a devout Catholic will tell you that it's a good thing to have, even if it makes you uncomfortable. If there was no hell, there would be no need to resist sin. Disbelieving in hell, or not wanting it to exist, doesn't mean that it doesn't exist.\n\nLike virtually all lapsed Catholics, you have an issue with the Sixth Commandment. Fair enough. A devout Catholic will tell you that you can either pick up your cross and struggle through it, or you can say no. The modern world tells us to say no. You're rolling your eyes at the women in the 12 step meetings. Ask them, and they'll say that a modern world that encourages masturbation is the problem.\n\nHave I seen Christianity improve people's lives? Yes, of course. I am one such person. I did the whole \"this is Puritanical bullshit\" thing for a while, and it didn't make me any happier. I found that doing things my way was a road to nowhere. Of course, it would be easier to give into give into every temptation that falls into my lap. Would be easier to skip Mass on Sundays and never pray the rosary again. I have a battle with myself every time I get into the car and there's some jerk in front of me going 5 under the speed limit on a single lane road. Raging at them won't make me any happier. Regardless of it being easier or not, that's not what's important. The important thing I'm gunning for is Heaven, and whether I like a teaching or not, I've seen too much that affirms Church validity for me to not believe in her.",

                "Early christianity, I think before St Augustine, had a massive problem with suicide, they'd convert people, teach them about how wonderful heaven was, extole the virtues of martyrdom, get them to give them all their worldly possessions, set them to labour hard for them in some commune, and then, shock and horror, they'd kill themselves, pissing off their families ,and the religious leaders who hoped to get years of free labour out of them, and making christianity look like a death cult.  They made suicide a sin in response. \n\nThat said religion studies show that religion tends to make people at least say they are happier, more self-statisfied, more judgemental, significantly not more moral in any way but they are percieved as more moral and they get lighter sentences and are less likely to be charged with the crimes they commit.",
                "I always hear this stuff but can't you just repent before death and if you are true to it then you get into heaven? Wasn't that the whole thing about Jesus dying for our sins and redeeming the Criminal that was beside him while they were being crucified?",

Allergens like these aren't arent a recent invention. And you strongly desire, as a a leader, to keep your people safe and disease free. Religion is a convenient means to do this, its spread amongst people and they don't really have to know why.",
                "Religion is a multi-purposed, complicated structure. It will give different experience to different people.\n\nThat story about a suicide attempt as a kid is insane, and I wish that will never be the case again. However that is the interpretation his parents or society gave him. I was personally (as a muslim, still am today) given an interpretation that God will always forgive me with sincere repentence and that I should abstain from the sin as much as possible. Because of this, I did fear Allah (SWT), but rather in a loving manner where I know he can forgive. Thus I never had problems like that, even to this day (alhamdullilah).\n\nIn the end, what I'm trying to say is that we will interpret and experience vast and complex faiths differently. Some people will feel like they had worse and more fearful lives thanks to these abrahamic religions. And others the opposite.\n\nSo interpretation is key, I think.",
                "As a Christian, I would argue Christianity absolves the fear it \"creates\".",
                "It is not necessarily supposed to improve your life. I will say what you are talking about with being afraid of sin and demons and going to hell, that is not good. But since I have become a Christian, it has basically been heart surgery. I was in deep denial about a lot of things that have been wrong in my life. I was working and putting my worth in very superficial things, like how financially secure I was or how strong I was. I was oblivious to how spending 18 hours a day playing Runescape for 7 or 8 years during my childhood affected me, and why my parents didn't do anything about it. I was oblivious to how I became a scumbag chasing after sex on tinder after I joined the navy. I pretended to be interested in girls on there but only to have sex, I was in a relationship with someone I didn't really care about but it was nice to have a gf and to have sex, but i literally had no intentions in staying with her long term. \n\nI told my fiance everything about my past before we got married, and that triggered a week long panic attack, because it's the first time I've told anyone things that i thought would cause them to hate or reject me. So in a way all of this has turned my life upside down, but it has revealed a dark reality, and how shallow my concept of \"love\" was. Before I was Christian I sure felt more stable, but I was in denial and oblivious to what was wrong in my life. A lie to keep the peace is not love. And ultimately the truth will always come out. \n\nThe fear of hell is mitigated by the fact that Jesus died for us. A passage that made me realize this was Romans 4:5 that says \"whoever does not work but trusts God who justifies the ungodly, their faith will be credited as righteousness.\" And in Romans 8 he says, if God didn't spare his own son for us, how will he not be willing to give us all things.\" In other words, while humanity was at its worse, Christ died for all, so there is assurance that God will not reject us. He will discipline us and correct our ways when we do evil/immoral things, and sometimes he will let us live in immorality until the consequences of that immorality hit us in the face, but he still doesn't leave us. \n\nJesus promised us we would suffer for being his disciples, that's why he said to count the cost because it's not easy. That's something churches have really misled people in. And Jesus says he would rather people be hot or cold, so it's better to leave the faith for reasons you are talking about than to be in the middle.",
                "Can I ask why you left out Judaism if it's an abrahamic religion? You can't pick and choose",
                "If you have some knowledge of Christianity, then perhaps you are familiar with Ephesians 6:12 \"For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.\" (KJV)\n\nI firmly believe that Satan tried to stamp out Christianity numerous times over the last 2000 years and failed. He learned that it is here to stay, so instead of stamping it out, he has been doing what he did in Jesus's day with the Pharisees and Sadducees, and has man focused on the religious aspects of believing in God, rather than in cultivating a relationship with Him as He intended. A lot of so called Christians are more focused on the religious aspects then what it truly means to be a follower of Christ.\n\nI am Christian and I agree with you, there are probably more people who say they are Christian that do bad and wrong and turn people away from God then there are who truly follow the Lord. I also believe this is all part of Satan's plan to take away from God as many people as possible. It was happening in Jesus's day, why would today be any different? If anything, I would argue it is worse today.\n\nThere are true followers of Jesus that live by his two commandments. They love their neighbor as they love themselves, and they love their God with all their heart.\n\nI'll throw this one back at you OP: you can know a tree by its fruit. When you look at one who says they follow God but they lack any fruit, are they really Christians?\n\nMatthew 25 states it will with the parable of the 10 virgins. Those 10 virgins are \"Christians\" - not all \"Christians\" are going to make it to the wedding feast, and Jesus knew that before Christianity even started to be a following or its own religion.",
                "> I think Abrahamic religion creates more fear than it absolves\n\nYour experiences and observations are definitely powerful, but they don't reflect the entirety of Abrahamic religions. Rather, they demonstrate the effect of extreme interpretations and misapplications. Remember, we're not just looking at anecdotes here, we're dealing with centuries of theology, tradition, and countless individual experiences, right?\n\n> Armin Navabi...so afraid of sinning and going to hell...jump off of a building in a suicide attempt.\n\nTragic, absolutely. This, however, demonstrates a misinterpretation of religious doctrine, not an inherent flaw within it. Doesn't it strike you as an indication of poor education and misunderstanding rather than an indictment of the religion itself?\n\n> I've seen Christian women in 12 step programs because they want to give up masturbating.\n\nYes, sexual repression can stem from strict religious teaching, but let's not forget it also comes from societal norms, personal guilt, and other non-religious sources, wouldn't you agree?\n\n> I've seen lesbians and gay men living in total abstinence terrified, self hating, and alone because they want to appease God and their families...\n\nThis is more indicative of societal stigma and misuse of religious doctrine, rather than inherent problems in the religion. Don't you see how conflating social prejudices with religious tenets could potentially skew the perception of a religion\u2019s impact?\n\n> For me personally...I used to be terrified of going to sleep...because I was a kid.\n\nAs a child, the mind often interprets things in extreme ways, especially without proper guidance. Could this fear have been mitigated with a more balanced and understanding approach to teaching religion?\n\n> My biggest reason for leaving Christianity was how much it influenced me to be so utterly afraid of my own thoughts, feelings, emotions, and experiences.\n\nIsn't it important to remember that this reflects your personal experience, which isn't universally shared by all who follow these religions? There are many who find comfort, solace, and personal growth within their faith.\n\n> I am more mentally healthy and emotionally stable...I believe Christianity facilitated mental illness for me and amplified any existing ones that I had.\n\nPersonal experiences are valid, but can we really extrapolate them onto a global scale, to billions of people from diverse backgrounds?\n\n> I see this in a large percentage of devout Christians that I've interacted with. As well as that, cruelty from those who they fear may break them away from their belief system.\n\nSurely, you'd admit that this isn't unique to Christianity, or religion in general? Many groups, religious or not, exhibit the same behavior when they perceive their norms to be under threat.\n\n> It made my depression, anxiety, and life innumerably worse.\n\nOnce again, a reflection of your personal journey, which shouldn't be generalized to everyone's religious experience. There are countless individuals who credit their religion with helping them overcome similar struggles, wouldn't you agree?\n\n> I'm also bisexual and transgender...my life's never been better and I've never suffered more in this life than when I was a Christian.\n\nUnfortunately, many religious communities have failed to adequately respect and understand LGBTQ+ individuals. But isn't it the prejudiced interpretations and practices we should blame, rather than the religions themselves?\n\n> I want to know your opinion on this, how have you seen Christianity improve people's lives?\n\nMany individuals derive deep comfort, purpose, and ethical guidance from their religion. They gain a sense of community, a framework for understanding life\u2019s complexities, and mechanisms to cope with personal and collective hardship. Isn't it plausible that these positive aspects can improve people's lives significantly?\n\nSo, what makes you think that fear is the predominant consequence of Abrahamic religions, when there are clearly a multitude of interpretations and experiences, many of which are decidedly positive?",
                "You list very extreme examples. I'm an atheist, but I cannot deny the myriad positive effects that religion has on community cohesion and identity. Many religious people are happier for having obliged to their religion's moral codes, whether voluntarily or coerced by fear of the afterlife.",
                "If you are looking for testimony about improving lives from faith, others have written about the incredible community it has provided.  For me it helped me realize my value and that I was loved, and gave me excellent guidance on how to live my life in a way that was much more purposeful during a time when I felt completely broken and depressed.  On the point you make about women trying to stop masturbating (which you imply is a bad thing), I (a man so maybe slightly different) have literally had my life changed for the better in so many ways by conquering my lust.  My relationships are so much more fulfilling, honest, and respectful.  My self control over other parts of my life has improved markedly.  If you want secular benefits of following Church teaching, there's a million of them.\n\nAnd for what it's worth I think stories like these are FAR FAR more common than what you described and the data about happiness and fullfilledness bear this out.  \n\n\nSeparately what you wrote about fear I don't think is really fair to attribute to faith.  It honestly sounds like a lot of the fears and terrors I had about death when I was growing up before I came to the church.  I caught a couple glimpses of a few scary scenes in crime shows when I was young and used to stay up all night constantly afraid I was going to get shot through my window, and lived constantly in fear of hidden assassins and bombs. I wouldn't say that CSI is some terrifying menace to the world. I would say that I clearly had issues with an overactive imagination and paranoia as a child that were triggered by something I may have been exposed to at too young an age that was probably at worst totally innocuous.  I think its more likely the case that you and I just have overactive and paranoid minds than it is that Christianity is at fault for this affliction that I experienced before I had faith, and most Christians don't experience at all.  Perhaps what you're describing is very different, but it sounded similar to me.",

                "I think if you take the Bible seriously (I don't anymore) then this fear is to be considered a feature, not a bug.  If Hell is real then you should be terrified by that, and that fear should drive you to do whatever you need to do to avoid damnation.  To defend religion on the basis that it improves one's temporal life is to flirt with heresy.",
                "religion, philosophical schools, movements, science, ideas, every fruit of the human thinking could be used to do good or bad. the dinamit technology was invented to help miners, but then it was used in conflicts. the nuclear energy could be used to power entire cities, or it could be used to wipe them off the earth. socialism could be used to bring social justice, but they used it to control and kill millions. evolution theory was the engine of nazism. the list goes on and on. the source of evil is whatever goes inside people's minds, the rest are just tools in their hands.",
                "If we were to make an all-encompassing calculation, religion may not be beneficial overall. But that doesn't mean that it doesn't have its good sides.  I think it grants a sense of deeper meaning, belonging and purpose which the atheist world view lacks. Maybe because it is shaped not by analytical observations of reality, but from what makes emotionally sense for humans.\n\nLike the soul. When trans people describe being \"born in the wrong body\", it doesn't make much sense from a clinical science perspective\u2014you *are* your body, you're not born into it\u2014but even life-long atheists can easily grasp the meaning, because the concept of body and soul is emotionally real.\n\nSame with sin. There is no actual sin-substance attaching itself to us when we do something wrong. Yet, in a study were people were told to think about a shameful act they had once commited, the group who also washed their hand reported to be less burdened by their past misdeeds.",

                "I\u2019m so glad I have never been in this position.",
                "Clarifying question:\n\nIs this *only* about \"fear of the afterlife\"? Or are other aspects of society relevant too?\n\nFor example, let's imagine that Christianity/Islam reduced crime by instilling morality in people. I'm not saying it does, but if it did, and as a result people had less reason to fear violent and property crime, would that count?\n\nAnd while I'm *very* reluctant to make this obnoxious philosophically pedantic argument: if keeping homosexual people in the closet reduced the fear many seem to have of homosexual people, would *that* count?\n\nIt's certainly true that Christianity/Islam *prey* on the fears that people have. Particularly  about dying and what happens after they die. \n\nChristianity offers a rather simple solution to these fears: accept Christ as your savior and repent you sins and you'll have everlasting happiness. \n\nOf course, they do it mostly for control of the population, but did they *create* the fear of death and what happens afterwards, or did it already exist? I'd say almost certainly the latter. Certainly as an atheist that has no belief in the Christian hell, *I'm* still pretty anxious about the thought. \n\nBasically: what are we adding on and what are we removing from the fear count?",
                "I want to deconstruct \"more fear\".  You seem to be describing several groups which were/are oppressed & there are many.  However, those groups represent very small populations.  So if the system supports 90% of the population in one way & oppresses 10% of the population in 100 ways, are you saying that 1:100 = more fear? Or are you factoring in that 90% are pacified & 10% are oppressed? \n\nI think it's also worth describing *when* specifically you're making this evaluation.  Religion has kept marauders from raping & killing people in deserted areas where no one else would know.  It was a system to feed the hungry & educate the ignorant before those systems were in place.  The way that we view religion today is starkly different for what it has done for humanity over millennia.",
                "This will all depend on the community and specific kind of teachings. Those who follow abrahsmic religion equally include a gay trans man from Virginia who's more liberal and ready for reform than most just as much as it includes a 17 year old Islamic fundelmentalistic from Jordan. But it's easy to see their views and interpretation of the role and scope of religion is gonna be different.",
                "Fear and leading, controlling with it as _human tendencies_.  We see them in all systems of power and belief.  To lay this into one specific religion when we seem to carry it wherever we bring people seems a mistake (or rather it seems both true, but not because of the religion but because the religion is people and you find the same thing outside of these religions).\n\nFor example, I live near a super hippy town filled with atheists.  However, they have a set of thriving crystal shops where people buy crystals to protect them bad energy, 5g and kids commit suicide because they fear of a world without trees and death through global warming.  While I prefer this edge of insanity to the one under religion, it's not one without fear..in fact, you see people pulling themselves from religion only to seek out another fear-based explanation for choice and action.\n\nI'd suggest that any all covering idea framework for a person will become the narrative for their depression and fear - if they move on that thing is demonized and \"moved past\" as problematic.  If they embrace it then it's doing them good and it's an improvement relative to alternatives.  \n\nHumans create suffering and they'll bring it with them wherever they go!",
                "> I think Abrahamic religion creates more fear than it absolves\n\nConsidering how long they've been around, and how much it has evolved and branched out, and how much money is involved, even after two millenniums, you have to admit that on some level it \"works\". So the question is, why does it work in spite of the fact that it engenders fear as an element of it's design? The obvious answer is that the fear must have high utility value. It's an unpleasant feeling that somehow ultimately contributes to greater pleasant feelings. The reason why that is involves the complexity of people's emotions. \n\n> I'm also bisexual and transgender, so I see alot of people comparing LGBT issues to indoctrination and making people suffer and commit suicide. But honestly, my life's never been better and I've never suffered more in this life than when I was a Christian.\n\nIn sum, the benefit of religion is community, which comes from common cause. The more in common, the more community. That's why gays and drug users and other ethnicities were traditionally excluded, because variety goes against the idea of commonality. \n\nThe LGBTQ community is very diverse, so you'd think they should burst apart in every direction, but it's actually standing in opposition to religion that gives them common ground, and so as religion becomes more accepting of LGBTQ, both of them mutually lose utility as a uniting force.",

Thank God the problem went away after that.\n\nAs for your friend, I've heard Muslims say the same thing that somehow it works with Christians. I suspect it is because they still believe in God, and they invoke His name, with intention for Him to block out the evil. God is mighty and hears. Edit: also relevant, Satan hates God's name and cannot stand to hear it.

                "At 14 you don't have a lot of options. Don't fight it or they'll make it worse. If they are going more strict, then they likely cannot be reasoned with. My parents weren't insanely religious, but had practices that made my life miserable in some respects, like the belief that sleeping in on the weekends was a waste of time, so it didn't matter if I was up late studying or playing games, they would still wake me up at 9am regardless, even if I told them I was going to have to stay up late studying. This is just a small example though. I setup a plan with 2 of my friends, started working and saving. Managed to save up about 9k since I had no expenses and then moved out on a weekend without telling them. Moved into a 3 bedroom apartment to lessen the expenses. It was difficult because I was going to college and working, but it was far easier working within my own schedule, not having to go to church or deal with their ridiculous rules. My parents were of course shocked and disappointed, but I told them that their house and rules were oppressive and I would never go back to live with them and I never did. I also told them I would no longer go to church with them. It made them mad, but they eventually reconciled it and we continued to have a relationship. With your parents being how they are, I would prepare that this will not be the case if you move out and stop going to church with them, so just know that they may be the ones who cut off contact. I really hate what religion does to parents and people...it really is harmful.",

                "Hey friend, \n\nthat is tough to hear. We can only give you vague advice, because we don't know the whole story, but I want to share one idea with you. \n\na) Tell your parents that you want to talk about your feelings with them and ask for a dedicated conversation about that. Not on the dinner table or between the doors - really sitting down and talking. Maybe one day after dinner. \n\nb) Prepare a list with what worries you and how you feel about the situation. Give your best to avoid accusing \"you\" formulations. Best way to start these sentences is by \"I feel like...\" Or when you said X, I feeled like Y. I do not know how emotionaly literate your parents are, but it is important that they understand that this is not about you accusing them, but about how you feel. \n\nc) Ask them how they feel. You can prepare questions for that, too. Don't ask them so much about why they want to do X, but about how they feel in their current situation. Make them help you understand where they are comming from. \n\nd) And then it's about finding a way together.aybe they can move when you are 16 and you have an easier time doing things by yourself. Maybe you can help them with doing some more in the household if they feel overwhelmed as it is now. Maybe there is something we are all missing. \n\n\nI wish you all the best mate!

You are not legally obligated to follow your parent's commands. Then when they try stealing your shortpants/phone/ whatever else, report them. What they would be doing is illegal. From what you said, they are already at least partially violating your right to privacy and few other things. But since it is religiously motivated... nobody will care.\n\nIf it gets too bad, take your things a book it to friends or other family you can trust.\n\nThe \"just do nothing until you are at least 18\" is a terribly dangerous approach.

He however also said that no laws will be changed and prior to him there was no concept of hell, so idk. \n\nAFAIK in Hinduism everything is more about the cycle so one would go to \"hell\" but then return back to earth and have countless chances to go to \"heaven\" however I just read some articles on that topic and I am absolutely not an expert.\n\nNonetheless the thing is there are many religions, the concept of afterlife is different in each of them and to be frank all of them are most probably made up.

Of all the mythology that believers agree are fiction, what convinced them their story was not? So far, their answers are not convincing. \n\nFanciful flights of fantasy are made up by humans all the time. Fanciful flights of fantasy that are real are not.

                "The start to my deconversion came from my love of greek mythology. At one point when studying it i remember thinking \"how silly it is that these people would think burning animals in a temple to Zeus when obviously life would show that this made no difference.\"\n\nAnd then i had an accidental self reflective moment realizing my reasons for believing were no better than theirsn i had just been taught ways of letting the god i believe in off the hook (god always answers... it is just that sometimes the answer is no).\n\nFor me that began an unstoppable slide toward disbelief. But not a loss of interest in religions.\n\nAnd the more you learn about any single religion, but also religions as a class of beliefs as a whole the more obvious it is that they are human creations.\n\nYou start to see common themes that religions try to solve (but most in mutually contradictory ways). Fear of death. Explanation for the unknown. Discomfort with randomness. Desire for protectors. Hope for magical ability to influence the world around us. Desire for origin stories. Etc. In some cases desire for a sense of cosmic justice since the world doesn't seem fair.\n\nAnd once you start seeing the different lego pieces that make up religions, it becomes pretty easy to see how different human groups would develop different answers to these questions, how those answers would change over time with influence from neighboring groups and as scientific and historical understanding improved.\n\nEven tracking specific concepts like the creation and evolution of ideas of hell is interesting, and the more you learn the more obvious the human origin of them becomes.\n\nIs it possible that of all the people groups across time making up stories about gods 1 of them happened to have gotten it right? Maybe. But it is indistinguishable from all the ones that got it wrong in that case.\n\nIs it possible there is a god and they care deeply about one group of people and hung out only with them while hiding from others but never gave that group any better evidence than all the groups that were making it up? Possible, sure. Don't see any reason to think it is true.\n\nAround the world most cultures have fairy tales that they tell kids. Santa clause or Little Mermaid or tooth fairy or the bell of Notre Dame flying out to deliver presents or Father Christmas or Elves that move stuff while people are sleeping.\n\nMost people grow up, learn their own fairy tales are fairy tales and come to understand how fairy tales work. So when they encounter a new culture and that culture tells them \"oh, in our culture we believe that gnomes sometimes hide our keys\" they are able to recognize the cultural hallmarks. They don't have to spend months researching every fairy tale of every culture in order to have a pretty good understanding that this type of story has understandable cultural origins.\n\nReligions are exactly the same way.\n\nIf one of them out there turns out to have actual evidence, then people can always reassess their stance. Just like if we did find a workshop at the north pole we could reevaluate santa.

If these texts were written by a god, they should contain things they couldn't have possibly known. Like germ theory, evolutionary theory, or newton's laws of motion. The fact that there is more than one religion. If God actually existed, there would be only one religion, and it would be a part of science and history, not faith. The fact that we have seen various cults form and die within our lifetime shows that religion can't be true. We know how and why religion forms. The fact that religion doesn't make people more moral, actually just the opposite. Terrible atrocities are committed under the guise of religion. Modern science makes God belief obsolete.

This is a problem in very early times because churches controlled education and historical study until the last 100 years or so. Why did the Roman Catholic church burn those who wanted non-Latin translations, could it be because they controlled all the institutions where you could learn Latin? This leads to the third step.\n\nExamine the history of the organisations and groups who push these doctrines.

[You could pay to get your unbaptised dead baby out of limbo, you could pay to give your dead relatives an easier time in purgatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indulgence). Look at the history of limbo doctrine, for almost 2000 years the Catholic church insisted it was real until the 1960's when it suddenly wasn't according to that same organisation. It's interesting that the doctrine of limbo declined along with a decline in post-natal mortality rates due to modern medicine don't you think? Less dead babies per 100,000 of the population, less certainty about the doctrine of limbo.\n\nBarely a few months ago the Pope stood in front of a microphone and claimed that it isn't such a great sin to have sex before marriage but the prohibition on contraception remains, not surprising at all when you look at the worldwide figures for children born out of wedlock, particularly in traditionally Catholic countries and again when competing orthodoxy's are out-competing you in birth rates.

Particularly if the belief I am being told to accept is monumentally important to my model of reality or to how I live my life. Smaller claims, like \"I have a pet dog\" are of a different category, where it doesn't make major alterations to my model of reality if the claim turned out to be false, and it doesn't have any implications on how I live my life. Moral implications are especially important to be careful of, as I don't seek to harm others in some unnecessary way.\n\nThere are apologists for every religion and superstition who will attempt to argue that what they believe is based on reason, evidence, and observation, but the reason I tend to be dismissive of these apologetics is because I identify patterns in their arguments known as \"logical fallacies,\" where if we applied a similar type of reasoning we could reach conclusions contrary to what they believe or just simply be able to justify anything using that sort of reasoning.\n\nTestimony is amongst the weakest forms of evidence we have, and it becomes even weaker when that testimony defies our experience and our model of how reality works. \"I saw Joe drive away in a red Corvette\" is different from \"I saw Joe flap his hands and fly away thousands of feet into the air.\" Maybe both are false, but the latter claim is much less likely to be true since we can't establish people are capable of flying like that. We have established people are capable of having a Corvette and driving it. You see?\n\nHell is a claim in that more extreme category, where it doesn't match with any evidence we have access to, we just have stories, and we know people make up superstitious nonsense all the time.

God is real, and \u2018Islam\u2019 is simply surrendering your life to that Creator, and following the guidance He has revealed.\n\nMany people who claim faith & understanding cause people to swerve from the path, whether it be by their hypocrisy, overbearingness, misinformation, or otherwise. But our focus should be on God\u2014the One who created us\u2014and leading a life conscious to Him, and doing the right thing for His sake. This is the path of the believer. I know you have struggled with many things, but I promise this isn\u2019t the decision you want to make.\n\nMany people will dislike this message, and do everything they can to cause you to ignore it. But I have been in your shoes before\u2014and I can tell you that judging by pure emotion over logic is not the way to go. We have a purpose; and the world around us bears testimony to that. Do not let people stuck in confusion, resentment, or frustration drag you down with them. Come back to your Creator; and your Lord is always willing to forgive and guide to the straight path those who are willing & sincere.\n\n\nAnd remember: God does not need us. We need Him.\nPeace.\n\n***\u201dO you who believe! Whoever of you goes back on his religion\u2014then God will simply bring forth another people whom He loves, and who love Him back; lenient towards believers, and assertive with disbelievers. They shall strive with effort in the cause of God, and will not fear the criticism of the critic. That is God\u2019s Grace, which He bestows it upon whomever He wills. And God is Embracing and Knowing.\u201d*** \u2014 _Qur\u2019an 5:54_",

                "I also realized the Christian leaders are simply vying for power. Condemning sexual acts in SHEER details and leaving out others (like pedophilia). Which always happened to align with their own culture **for some reason.** Coincidence? No.   \nAlso, the creation story of Adam and Eve actually has predating equivalents like that of Pandora or that of Gilgamesh (surrounding regions in the middle east). All of those earlier creation stories had three things in common: humans were made out of clay, knowledge is a pivot, and woman was to blame for the fall and suffering of humanity.   \nCoincidence?   \nOh and it was the habit of authors back then to reform earlier stories to kind of valorize or be able to give a name to their own culture. No such thing as copyright infringement. We see that in Roman Virgil's Aeneid that took so much from Greek Homer's works (to valorize the Roman culture among the dominant Greek one). We even see that when Muhammad met monk Bahira as you'll see shortly.\n\nLiberals, understandably, don't feel the need to criticize islam because it's not the religion engendering social issues in America, where muslims are an oppressed minority, so they naturally and understandably resort to criticizing Christianity. Liberals, of whom I am one, and a middle eastern ex-christian myself, unfortunately don't understand that islam is an actual historical expansion of Christianity. Early Christianity had countless sects, including Nestorianism (an early Christian denomination that held that Jesus was a prophet, but not god. It was VERY popular.). There was also the proto-Orthodox sect (on whose basis are most of today's prominent Christian doctrines predicate). It received political power and recognition because it could successfully reach the emperor, unlike both Nestorianism and the gnostic pro-feminine Gospel-of-Mary sects, which didn't receive political power and were kind of swept under the rug and deemed \"heretical\" by the sect that received power. And as you know, the victors write history.  \nThe thing about Muhammad was that he met a Christian Nestorian monk named Bahira when Muhammad was 9-12 years old, and the monk told Muhammad and his uncle that Muhammad would become the great leader of the \"new religion\", you know, Islam, which, \"coincidentally\" holds exactly Nestorian beliefs. And so, Islam, at its core, is a Christian sect that was formerly rejected by those in power and that rejection seemed to backfire and spiral and mutate into the most violent Christian sect and religion (mixing with some pagan ideas, like the Kaaba stone) humanity has known. So yeah, that's what liberals just can't see. That it all has the same origin.  \nAnd there it is, ladies and gentlemen, the tasty fruits of primitive tribalism and dualism.",

But my guess is (and not unique to women), some just want to (more-or-less) subjugate themselves to another so, ... well, ... they don't have to think (so much), don't have to make those tough decisions, and ... and point at someone else for all the blame (not really, but that doesn't mean they won't try).  I think it's a more general things with cults, charismatic leaders, etc.  Many just wanna be followers ... of ... well, whatever/whomever.\n\n>women who willingly submit to their husbands\n\nYeah, ... my sister was one 'o *those*.  Well, ... at least until she wasn't.  \"Dear hubby\" - now ex - of now multiple felony convictions for abuse within the family, multiple persons diagnosed with severe mental illness condition(s) due to the trauma, etc.  Yeah, she was all for goin' for the \"'till death do us part\" goop, and some other sh\\*t about husband being the decider/leader for the family and wife for some sh\\*t like that.  Before she got married, though was a \"battle\", I did get her to at least agree that if he ever abuses her or the kids, that's sufficient valid reason to bow out of the marriage.  But alas, she was way deep sunk into it, and that sh\\*t got really really bad, before she started to back out of it.  And, yeah, she and hubby were doing quite the job to hide that sh\\*t from everyone too.  Well, ... by the time police were seriously involved, and emergency retraining orders, and arrest, etc. ... some of these \"secrets\" started leaking out.  Man what a sh\\*t show was goin' on there.  Yeah, \"dear hubby\" had been gatekeeping all communication in and out of the family ... for *decades*.\n\nSo, yeah women (and men) ... please don't be stupid.  I mean if you want to believe in magic pixie dust or whatever ... well, ... whatever.  But don't be f\\*ckin' up people's lives with your beliefs ... especially those of others.  Just don't.",

Anytime someone else finds \u201cbeauty\u201d in the Christian faith of a Latino, I want to throw up. There is no beauty to be found in the Catholic culture which was the result of colonialism and genocide and rape and the utter destruction of an entire culture.\n\nWill I be nice to your face?

I'm agnostic/atheist as an adult but realistically the church I grew up in really wasn't problematic. There was zero preaching of women's place and such, the bible was treated more as allegories on how to live your life vs strict doctrines, we were thrilled with gay folks (pride flag and an open and affirming on the church signs, lots of gay wedding officiated), zero issues with abortion and they did some real community good regardless of religion (I actually still donate to one of the organizations they heavily worked with because it's such an effective org at keeping people from becoming unhoused and there's zero religious requirement to get help from it).

Like alot of the misogyny in Abrahmamic religion is not actually based in the texts but based on people rewording and re-interpreting sections. So for example Eve being made out of Adams rib is a mistranslation of the word Tsela which means side (it is used elsewhere in the bible to reference a side of a door so thats how we know how it is translated) so rather than taking a small piece out of Adam god removed a side of Adam (which I have seen used in argument about the Abrahamic god being trans since Adam was made in its image and if a \"side\" of \"him\" was a woman ....).

I\u2019ve had two abortions and was encouraged to talk openly about them. In fact, Jewish law dictates that abortions are morally imperative in cases where the health of the mother, including mental health, is at risk. \n\nMy rabbi did private lessons with every student leading up to their Bar/Bat Mitzvah where we\u201412-13 year olds\u2014were encouraged and expected to debate and discuss our Torah portions with our rabbi\u2014a man in his 50s with a phd. He genuinely listened and honored our opinions and input. He reflected on our talks and referenced them when addressing the community. When he retired, the synagogue hired a female rabbi. We were seen as equally deserving of a place at the table in all ways. And my experience is not unique. Everyone I know who grew up Jewish, outside of people in a very small and isolated community of Hasidic Jews, had a similar experience of their Jewish upbringing.\n\nObviously my experience isn\u2019t universal. Judaism has its crazies, its zealots, its misogynists, no doubt, but in its modern American community it is by and large very egalitarian and supportive of women.

                "As an atheist/agnostic - No, it depends entirely on the individual and how they practice their religion. In fact, I think inherently judging women who follow a religion is in itself an example of internalized misogyny (or just straight up misogyny, depending on who's doing the judging). It assumes that they don't know better and are incapable of nuance when it comes to their beliefs/being critical of their religion.\n\nWeirdly enough, this take actually reminds me a lot of my dad. He was an atheist, a progressive, and a self-proclaimed \"feminist\". He was also an alcoholic and domestic abuser. His abuse was mostly emotional/intellectual - He used to bully my mum for being a Catholic and justified it by saying it was hypocritical of her to describe herself as a feminist whilst following such a patriarchal religion. Whether or not he was technically correct is irrelevant - in that situation, he was the one reinforcing patriarchal power structures, not her.\n\nWhat's more, my mum's identity as a Catholic is largely cultural, due to her upbringing, and incredibly nuanced. She'd probably more accurately be described as a theistic agnostic. She's pro-choice, very vocal about trans rights/intersectionality, has worked for women's shelters, raised money for period poverty etc. and views God as more of a philosophical, rather than spiritual entity. However, Catholicism is a part of her identity and, although she does not attend church regularly, she sees a lot of value in the community. A lot of her fondest childhood memories are tied to the church/singing carols with her mum/playing in church bands etc. Does it sound contradictory? Perhaps. But people are complex and I think making sweeping judgements about anyone for their religious beliefs is insanely reductive. I've met feminist/queer Muslims, Christians, and Jews and, based on their own personal philosophies and approaches to their religion, I don't see those identities as inherently incompatible.

                "This question is bound up with a whole bunch of issues and debates about the meaning of oppression, justice, and autonomy. Because you asked specifically about feeling negative about those life choices of women who adopt patriarchal religions, let\u2019s just focus on autonomy and respect for moral difference. In general, people think that autonomy either consists of having some competences, like rational thought, or being authentic in some sense, or both (see Autonomy in moral and political philosophy, stanford encyclopedia of philosophy, for more). You might say someone is autonomous just in case they followed a certain process to make their decision (a competence only view), for example. Or you might think they also need to identify with their choice in some way for them to be autonomous. But putting these conditions aside, people vehemently disagree about whether autonomy should be conceived of in a substantively moral or political way, namely as requiring that someone also satisfy certain moral or political conditions to count ss autonomous. So for example, some people say that a woman is not autonomous if the choice she makes precludes the conditions for her having self-respect. On this view, one might think that a woman who adopts patriarchal religions doesn\u2019t do so autonomously insofar as one thinks patriarchal norms are disrespectful to women and hence preclude the conditions for having self-respect as a woman. But there are some serious reasons to think that this morally substantive view of autonomy is wrongheaded. First and foremost, one might not share the same intuition that patriarchy is inherently disrespectful to women, perhaps in virtue of valuing submissiveness to men and care work. While feminists like myself may find patriarchal values like these anathema to achieving equality for all, one might think others may have legitimate moral differences in holding these views and deserve to live as they please. In addition to this, one might criticize the idea that people are not acting autonomously because they have internalized social norms by pointing out this threatens to make anything we do non-autonomous, since all we do is affected by the social world. Finally, saying the oppressed are not autonomous just because they need to make compromises about how to live in oppressive conditions - for example, by adopting a patriarchal religion - seems to some overly paternalistic by painting the oppressed as dupes and ignoring their agency in the face of their oppression. None of this is easy; these are hard questions. I invite you to read more and hope this helps!",

Not the dumb ones, the average ones. They do their homework, study, but their grates are always Bs and Cs - and when you look over their essays you can\u2019t believe what passes in their head for a train of thought. They all go on to become dentists and accountants and real estate agents lol, they\u2019re the people sitting next to you in traffic, the people beside you at polls. People don\u2019t have to be particularly smart to be productive in society, or a church - but yes we\u2019re surrounded by low-key animals. \n\nDidn\u2019t a study on here recently suggest most people don\u2019t even possess self awareness? I\u2019d read self awareness was a recent development in the human mind - (it\u2019s interesting stuff, it sounds like animalistic function with occasional \u201cintrusive\u201d thoughts, so foreign that surprised people would attribute them to gods and deities.) - so I guess it\u2019s not surprising so many are still lagging behind\u2026\n\nBut yes - I judge the continuing belief in any god, and adherence to unanalyzed teachings, to indicate a dull and uncurious mind. Like a belief in Santa Clause continuing into adulthood - it could indicate a very sheltered upbringing or lack of interest in questioning your surroundings - in the end they just don\u2019t seem very with it.\n\nAdd to that anyone who would use their faith to rationalize mistreatment of other groups - women, homosexuals, children - and we should find the limit to our tolerance for stupidity.\n\nI try to keep an open mind - recognize prejudices when they start to occur and dismantle them internally - and I think Sikhism may be my favourite of the organized religions - but\u2026\n\nI talk to my Uber drivers here in Canada, and it worries me. Nice Muslim men, but they think it\u2019s good for their wives to be kept away from the world (which means completely dependent and enmeshed in a world of her husbands creation and dictation). Our progress on so many social issues has been so modest, the spread of enlightened ideals so new and fragile, that I worry how easily we might lose ground and have to redo so many of these fights\u2026\n\nIts not just Muslims of course, I talk to Christians at work - meh men and women - but with very concerning conceits about the behaviours of others. I\u2019m sure their faith offers them some internal peace, but externally they\u2019re only using it torment others.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019d judge any woman who pushes silence and subservience on their daughters, rather than teaching them how to develop their agency and engage with the world - who build up their sons as minor gods whose pleasures and impulses are meant to be catered to by the lesser creatures on earth\u2026 they\u2019re not doing anyone good, no matter how closely they\u2019re following \u2018holy\u2019 teachings.",

I know plenty of people and organizations who do good work for others without a need to slap a religious label on it, and frankly I think we are advanced enough as a society for many of us to recognize human empathy and compassion don't need an excuse. We can treat each other well if we simply choose to do so and have empathy and don't need grifting leaders telling us we'll go to hell if we don't fund them or pushing their religious agendas on us through passing laws that hurt people while lining others pockets.\n\nA relative once tried to argue with me that religion was a unifying source for civilizations and I was quick to point back that trade of goods and services did the same thing, and that most wars and human misery and suffering were and still are based around one small elite group of the wealthy pushing their ideology on to others for financial gain and power and control. Nothing more.",
                "I'll be honest. When I see TikToks of women explaining their religion, about how the men in their life make decisions for them, how they're not allowed show certain body parts, or women in their religion aren't allowed to have certain jobs, or that their traditional place is in the home, I do worry about them. \n\nI'm all about respecting people's personal beliefs, and I like to think I wouldn't treat anyone different based on them. But that doesn't mean that the religion they follow is above criticism. \"It's a different culture\" that doesn't make oppression okay.",
                "Yes, Christian women have judged me negatively my whole life even when I was Christian myself. For things I now know are actually normal and okay, like using Legal substances sometimes, or having sex before marriage. A Christian friend of a friend implied that I was an unsafe person and bad influence because of those two things I listed before. And we\u2019re all over 21! \nI had my mental health disregarded by many Christian women too and my self confidence destroyed by women who\u2019ve made me feel like less of a woman for not being a sweet christian virgin. In my experience, it\u2019s almost always a Christian woman who stands up to defend a male-creep, too. \nSo on top of me judging the religion for all of its corruption, I also judge them for being so judge mental themselves.",

Okay see you at 6.\u201d \nBut I don\u2019t try to convert my friends.

Then I remind them who Jesus hung out with and they get real real quiet \ud83e\udd10) \n\n\nI would be quite offended personally for someone to think me having a faith should eliminate me from being a friend.\n\nBut I do recognize that some folks under the big Religious umbrella are not very friendly.",
                "Martin Luther King said you should judge ppl based on their character, or like their actions which are the physical manefestation of their character. \n\nLike if they're opressing people or treating people poorly and using their relegion for justification then I'd judge them as terrible people... but most ppl are just trying their best living their life as best as they know how.  \n\nIt is a lot harder to treat people as individual, rather than the label we ascribe to them.",
                "I think anyone subscribed to organized religion is mentally compromised... Personal religious beliefs and spirituality is one thing but church going Bible thumpers are generally the most ignorant, immoral, judgemental wastes of space I've ever met.",
                "No. Not unless they themselves are harming others with their actions and supporting harmful beliefs. \n\nI know many many religious men and women of all faiths you listed who are caring, empathetic, feminist and extremely active in supporting human rights. Im atheist but I support them fully and get frustrated on their behalf for all the judgement   I believe religion can be comforting and peaceful and healthy for some people."

This experience instantly cured my nihilism and later I learned it was called pantheism, popularized by Baruch Spinoza, one of the founders of the enlightenment.\n\nFun facts: Spinoza was being accused of atheism by the jewish community, this is why he chose to release his life's work 'Ethica' after his death.

It can be hard for people to wrap their heads around this, but if you use something like the Greek Iliad as an example for comparison - which was a straightforward text composed by numerous people over a much longer period of time, they're about the same length. Meanwhile the Qur'an was revealed over the period of about 20 years to only one person and was extremely complicated, and on top of that this person had no poetic training or ability to read anything that could be used as a reference.\n\nI like that Islam can be approached very systemically, so you always have a stable foundation of truth that gives you specific direction regarding what is important, or good or bad. If someone says 'Islam is X' I can just go and check what God and the Prophet (PBUH) said and either say 'yes that's true' or 'no that's false', as long as I put in the effort. I also like that it takes itself seriously and seeks to impose itself, which is what I'd expect of something claiming to have the universal and objective basis of morality.",

It just made no sense, and I didnt understand how it was possible that the big bang and evolution (especially this because you can literally see it with like other apes and monkey and humans) didnt happen to fit the narrative of god created the earth and animals and everything. And if adam and eve really were the first humans then every single person is a result of incest because there is no way 2 people alone can populate a planet by themselves without incest in some way or another.\n\nSo all of that added together made me just sort of stop questioning it and straight up stop believing",

I\u2019m talking about possessions, evil spirits, not just murders. Why would he allow that?? And why would there be mental disorders that get so bad people off themselves? And I\u2019ve been watching The Good Doctor, in one episode there was a pastor who got cancer. He told the doctor who doesn\u2019t believe in god that he gives people cancer as punishment. She says \u201cthere\u2019s an 8 year old girl down the hall, you want to tell her god is punishing her?\u201d And he then says he also gives cancer to people for *others to have a chance to show mercy*. I\u2019m sorry, so innocent people have to suffer and die so others can show mercy?? No. \n\nI somewhat created my own religion. Because there\u2019s *so many* out there, how do we know what one is the truth until we die?? In my eyes, God is ruler of heaven, he doesn\u2019t create us, earth, nothing. His job is to allow souls into heaven once they completed their destiny, their purpose in life on earth as human. And make sure the souls in heaven can go to earth in another body to watch over someone as a guardian angel when they\u2019re supposed to. \n\nEvery soul has a purpose as a human on earth and if they fail, they go to hell for the amount of earth years they were alive before they get another chance. Completing this purpose is their ticket into Heaven. And some souls get guardian angels to keep them going and help them make the right choices or simply remind their soul they can do this. Could be a pet, someone they get with and marry, their child, who knows. But I genuinely believe my cat is our dog who passed when I was 2. Dogs can take amazing care of their owners baby and our dog did just that for me.

                "None. I\u2019d consider myself an agnostic atheist. \n\nI feel like people who believe in gods do so because it makes them feel better, like praying is  meditation for them and helps keep their minds at ease. They need to believe in a god so that they can feel that their existence has a purpose and the religious texts basically guide them on how to live. I mean I get that realizing there\u2019s no purpose to our existence and not knowing the truth (which philosophy seeks) can be overwhelming, so when someone tells you that god is the truth and the religious text will give the answers it helps them cope with life and death (as in grieving the death of others and not being afraid of their own by believing they will meet in the afterlife or reincarnate or whatever their religion states). \n\nThough what I don\u2019t like is that religion is too often used as a means to hurt others. It needs to be more geared towards actual ethics instead of instilling sexism, misogyny, homophobia, transphobia and all sort of discrimination to whoever doesn\u2019t follow the standard gender roles are interpreted from the bible.\n\nFrom a google search I think the beliefs of Sikhism sound the best. \u201cSikhism has no specific teachings about homosexuality and the Sikh holy scripture, the Guru Granth Sahib, does not explicitly mention heterosexuality, homosexuality or bisexuality. The universal goal of a Sikh is to have no hate or animosity to any person, regardless of factors like race, caste, color, creed or gender.\u201d I mean that sounds like the most accepting religion to me. Though society will probably still oppress those that deviate from the \u2018norm\u2019 as society has always done. But in this case, the religion doesn\u2019t \u2018justify\u2019 it.\n\nThat being said, there\u2019s probably a bunch of other religions that I don\u2019t know about that are accepting like that. And many people that follow religions like christianity interpret the religion in their own way and don\u2019t discriminate.

Which is to say your subconscious is your own city where the conscious streets unwind, in your head you may superimpose an ideology about someone or something which for you is a subjective truth, but the objective truth is a conjoined statement from everyone's \"agreed\" subjective truth. Just like how everyone else who doesn't have autism has a collective identity that audists must fit into, we each have our own truth about autism, we as a collective subject have our own objective reality that is more similar to it's own subjective pocket reality within a larger objective reality, which leads to how all religious beliefs are valid because they are technically their own subjective pocket realities.

They either seek out confirmation bias and to reaffirm part of themselves, like a homophobe who is a devout Catholic/evangelical.

I found the spiritual side of it interesting, but couldn't really believe it due to the way I was brought up, but still practiced as a way of helping me organise my thoughts and feel more uplifted in my decisions. I didn't really believe it, but it helped give me a sense of confidence, so that was nice.\n\nBut then I started to have spiritual experiences, and I'm starting to believe in it more and more.

Some players who wanted control, but couldn't fight the ruling faction started telling people that they had direct connection with the devs, and all the players should obey them because they speak for the devs, otherwise they will get permabanned or get thrown in a torturous post game server or something. This was an OP strat because it played into the {fear of death} and {existential dread} mechanics in the game. This was so effective it even brought some ruling classes under their control.\n\nThere are thousands of groups which thousands of stories on who the dev(s) are or look like. But none have managed to get any meaningful buffs for themselves or their community that is not normally achievable by other players. They have not even managed to get a single bug addressed either. All they have are stories. \n\nTL;DR: It's really an exploit created by some smart early game players who wanted control but couldn't manage to stand up against the regional ruling factions (kings? royalty?) at the time.

                "All the religions, and all of its leadership, had gathered into a small room. None of them could resist the call. Even the more fringe religions were included, as were the heads of a number of online fan groups. Bill ran a group of online enthusiasts for the 1995 Toyota Corolla and even he got the call. So he went. He'd left in the middle of Whose Line is It Anyway to attend and didn't even realize until he got there. \n\n\"There\" happened to be a small room that somehow contained thousands of people, all sitting together in the same waiting room. No more than a dozen or so people seemed to be in the room at any given time. \n\n\"So this is 4D space,\" he said. \"Thought I'd feel more nauseous.\" \n\nSoon, he was ushered into a separate room by a small blob of light. The glowing orb didn't have wire-rim glasses, or a dreary grey blouse, or the sad beginnings of female-pattern baldness, but glowed as if it was these things. \n\n\"Hello dearie,\" the glowing presence said. \"I'm here to talk about your God.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Bill said. \"Am I in trouble?\"\n\n\"Trouble?! No! Goodness, no. You're not in trouble. Do you feel like you'd be in trouble?\"\n\n\"Well...maybe,\" Bill said, scratching his head. \"Is God real?\n\nThe blob bounced in understanding. \n\n\"Bill, when was the last time you spoke to your God?\"\n\n\"Spoke? What do you mean 'speak'...like a voice?\"\n\n\"Well is that how you normally communicate?\"\n\n\"Oh...well, no. No, I haven't. But I thought God is supposed to be like...I don't know...in all of us, I guess?\"\n\nThe blob stared for a minute, then flared a little corona. \"It's cases like these that are the hardest.\" The orb extended two little solar flares that wrapped themselves around Bill's hands. They were warm. \"This is not how a god should treat its creations. What you and the rest of your world is going through is not right. How your brothers and sisters fight each other! The total lack of rules and boundaries and structure! Well...I'm here to let you know that it's not right, what happened to you.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Bill said. \"Thank you.\"\n\nSuddenly there was a ringing in his chest. Than a slam. It was as though his soul was slapped against the walls of his ribcage. In his mind a presence formed, whirling and fiery and angry. The presence did not have a beer can in one hand and a rolled up TV guide in the other. Its breath did not stink of grain booze and cigarettes. But the voice that came out would have stank of it, as it said, \"I AM THE LORD. YOU KEEP TALKING AND YOU'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.\"\n\nBill pulled his hands away. Tears ran down his face. \n\n\"I need to go home,\" he said.\n\nThe solar orb flared its disc with concerned. \n\n\"Are you OK, Bill?\"\n\n\"No. Yes. I don't know. I don't want to get in trouble.\"\n\nYOU'LL BE IN A WORLD OF TROUBLE IF YOU DON'T CLOSE YOUR YAP\n\nBill recoiled from the voice in his chest and burst into tears.\n\nThe ball of fire seemed to dim, then burst, white hot and searing, like two supernovas shouting and screaming obscenities in a waiting room. Bill covered his ears. All around him melted, the 4D illusion peeling away as tens of thousands of people watched as God had a shouting tantrum in front office in front of the entire human species. Bill dared to take his hands from his ears.\n\n\"--your behavior is *plainly unaccceptable*. There are *sentients* in the room\"\n\nYOU DON'T GET TO USE MY NAME! YOU DON'T GET TO TELL ME WHAT I DO IN MY OWN CREATION! \n\n\"There are *standards*, and your behavior is in violation of those standards. If you continue this behavior you will be banished, now I need you to calm down and--\"\n\nDON'T YOU TELL ME TO CALM! DON'T TELL ME, I'LL TELL YOU, AND YOU CAN GET THE **HELL OFF MY--**\n\nAnd then the voice was gone. \n\nIt was as though ten thousands pounds of weight were lifted off his chest. No more judgment, no more terrible thoughts, no more shame...just silence. \n\nBill cried. So did all of his brothers and sisters--all eight billion of them.",
                "Lucien Greaves, the spokesperson of the Satanic Temple, nervously picked at his jet-black vest as he stared at Pope Francis across the table from him. For more than obvious reasons, the two didn't exactly love each other, though the situation has... changed. They looked around the room filled with religious - and religion adjacent - leaders from around the world; people of all colours, genders, and sizes, wearing various clothing... all extremely uneasy.\n\n\"So,\" Chief Rabbi Yitzhak Yosef finally spoke, breaking the tense silence, \"I believe we can all agree that it wasn't some sort of... group hallucination.\"\n\n\"All over the world?\" Mahant Swami Maharaj, a Hindu guru, pitched in. \"*At the exact same time*? Impossible.\"\n\n\"How does it feel to know God does exist, atheist?\" a venomous voice rang from the crowd; likely a less important religious figure.\n\n\"How does it feel to know he abandoned you?\" Greaves fired back coldly. Several of the leaders stared at him angrily, but held back.\n\n\"Let us recap the situation and move on,\" Pope Francis urged. \"Two days ago, we were all telepathically told the Divine Protection Service has removed us from the care of... of our god due to neglect.\"\n\n\"And that we're getting a foster god?!\" Yitzhak Yosef cried out. \"The- this whole thing is madness!\"\n\n\"Oh I *love* madness,\" a young man wearing a Cthulu T-Shirt in the corner chirped happily.\n\n\"Are we *absolutely* sure he's allowed here?\" Sikh Guru Nandgarh pointed out.\\*\n\n\"Do we- does anyone - have any idea who... the *New God* is going to be?\" Greaves asked.\n\n\"Or what he'll stand for?\" Maharaj continued.\n\n\"Or what he'll want from us?\" someone in the crowd yelled.\n\n\"Think they'll be cool with Witchcraft?\" a young Wiccan woman near the wall asked.\n\n\"*God* I hope not. I mean- *shit*,\" another voice said.\n\n\"Stop blaspheming!\" someone said.\n\n\"Against WHOM?!\"\n\nThe room erupted into a mess of arguments and yelling, hiding the escape of a young man in a clean business suit. He walked out carefully and elegantly, but with a resolution that made it clear no one could stop him. After he walked a good distance away from the room, he pulled out a modern-looking communicator.\n\n\"HQ, do you read me?\" he said.\n\n\"This is Site 18. Your communication is now forwarded to a member of the Council. You may proceed,\" the communicator replied.\n\n\"This is Field Agent \\[REDACTED\\]. Situation is going as expected.\"\n\n\"Acknowledged, Agent. Continue to monitor. Apprehend anyone who appears to have additional knowledge.\"\n\n\"Got it. But... HQ? I- I have a question,\" the Agent nervously admitted.\n\nThe woman on the other side of the line looked to the side and brushed away her greying hair. It was against protocol to indulge in such communication at a time like this, but... even to her organization, '*time like this*' was stretching it. She pressed the button on the microphone.\n\n\"Go ahead, Agent.\"\n\n\"The New God... do you... do you think it'll be benevolent?\" he asked grimly.\n\nThe woman sighed deeply and considered it. Despite her years of experience, she... did not know. But as she looked on the wall adorned with the organization's logo - a circle with three arrows pointed inwards within another symbol resembling a three-pronged gear - she felt a jolt of confidence.\n\n\"Whatever it will be,\" she said into the communicator, \"*we'll be ready*.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\**He was not.*",
                "Reactions were....mixed.\n\nTrue believers were outraged.  Power hungry cult leaders were worried.  Less stringent leaders adopted a wait-and-see approach.\n\nBut no matter what they did, the day finally came when the new Foster God arrived in Flame and Light and Glory and all knew exactly, and minute and fine detail, exactly how far short they came of purity and enlightenment.\n\n\"THIS RACE HAS BEEN WITHOUT A FIRM AND GUIDING HAND FOR TOO LONG.  THIS CHANGES NOW.\"\n\nEnforcers swept down and everyone had a 'Guardian Angel'.  Every street had patrols.  Every action watched and judged immediately.\n\nTechnically, it was a Golden Age.  No one went hungry or cold.  Sickness didn't exist anymore.   \n The leaders of humanity were honest and competent.  Everyone worked their best for the betterment of humanity and the the stewardship of the planet.\n\nAfter 10 years, not a single word of complaint was made about Foster God.  No one left would dare.  They had seen what happened to those who complained and strictly taught their children (of which there was many due to the need to replace population numbers) about the glories of Foster God and that they should be always vocal in their praise in all their waking days.\n\nBut deep in the thoughts of many smiling faces and warm greetings, many still wished for the times when they could debate the existence of Gods and ignorance of the hard truth that what is worse than a silent and uncaring and possibly non-existent God, is a God that there is no doubt at all of their existence and constant intervention to make things 'Perfect'.",
                "It was 20 December 2025. All broadcasts\u2014television, radio, everything!\u2014was hijacked by an extraordinary message. All screens were displaying the same text, even the ones broken or not plugged in. Entire warehouses of monitors just suddenly switched on without power supply. The white-on-black text stated\n\n\"Your god has been removed due to Divine Neglect. Please wait while we work on solving the issue. Thank you for your patience.\"\n\nThe text appeared in all spoken languages, depending on the native language of the viewer. On the radio, the message was transmitted via Morse code.\n\nTo say it was puzzling would be quite the understatement. Nothing else happened for 3 more days. Except that's a lie. Way too many things happened. Society didn't completely break down everywhere, but the disobedience was anything but civil in most places. Most religious figures tried to curb the event to their liking. \"Testing our faith\" was the most liked phrase. Some sceptics escaped into conspiracy theories. In their defence, suddenly those sounded a lot more rational, now that the alternative was a belief in an actual \u2026 service or agency of divine caretaking.\n\n3 days. On Tuesday, 23 December 2025, something finally happened. A voice appeared to every human on Earth. Some received it on their phones, others on their televisions or radios. People who didn't have access to any of these heard it directly in their ears.  It was a kind feminine voice.\n\n\"Hello, humans! We've received numerous complaints of Divine Neglect from You, as well as from concerned colleagues of your previously assigned god. We are very sorry to have put you through the previous couple million years. Your god, very unprofessionally, created your Universe and just sometimes jumped in to meddle in your affairs, instead of taking proper care of their creatures.\n\n\"We have assigned a brand new god to you. Their name is Doatoknha. They are one of those previously mentioned concerned colleagues. They will turn this horrible world of yours into a paradise, I promise. I'll now let them take it from here. Good luck!\"\n\nThere was brief pause. A much deeper voice spoke up.\n\n\"So, everyone should be awake by now. Hopefully curing the deaf worked, too. I am Doatoknha, your new divine caretaker. You can just simply call me \"God\". I assume not all of you will appreciate this little stunt of ours, but hopefully we'll get through these differences soon.\n\n\"First off, we'll be working on violent conflicts between your 'nations'. They absolutely have to go before we do anything else.\"",
                "Faith is an emotion on its own. To embark on a journey of faith, true faith is a right on its own. \n\nSome people have recently lost that right. They called themselves the champions, the flag bearers of  their religion but instead they forgot the one thing that made faith the most powerful force in the world, humanity. \n\nWe have been watching Earth since the dawn of man. We watched them learning to stand on their legs. We watched them when they found the wonderful thing that was fire. We also watched as they created the factions of God. It didn't matter. God was a multi-headed entity. Every religion saw just one face. Some religions saw more than one face and that was agreeable too. \n\nBut we also watched when humanity turned on each other. We watched when they used the name of God as an excuse for their sins. We watched when they started considering themselves God. We watched and watched and watched. \n\nWe watched when one day God couldn't take it anymore. We watched him see the world he built with so much love being destroyed by the ones he created, the ones he loved. We watched him leave. \n\nAnd we knew that we won't be able to watch anymore. \n\n*\n\n*Send a message in every language possible*\n\nWe, the members of the Divine Protection Services, have found the mass cases of neglect and thereby you are being removed from the custody of God. You will shortly receive a message about your Foster God. \n\nYours sincerely,\n\nThemara\n\nDivine Protection Services. \n\n*\nWe saw the confused faces of the religious heads. They clearly thought that it was some sort of hallucination. But they didn't dismiss it. Instead all of them claimed to be god's vessel. The one God trusts the most. \n\nWe laugh at their naivete and their sense of grandeur. They just lost the protection of the parent who loved them unconditionally, the parent who was so saddened by the state of his children that he couldn't take it anymore. \n\nWe just hope humanity has prepared themselves for their Foster God. \n\n*\n\nWe watched as the Foster God arrived at Earth waiting for a warm welcome. Even a tepid one would have worked instead of the tepid silence he got. \n\nThey considered him a trickster. A mockery. But it still hasn't settled that he would be their God for the foreseeable future. \n\nThey don't know who they have pissed off. \n\n*\n\nShould we do something? The question was uttered daily in the halls of Divine Protection Services. But no one answered. We weren't afraid. We were intrigued. \n\nWe have always thought that God loved his creations unconditionally, even when they sought to destroy. But the new one, the new one reminded everyone that there are consequences to their actions. \n\nHe slowly but surely straightened out the creases on the cloth of humanity. He never chose a policy of silent treatment or having a chance to learn from their countless mistakes. \n\nHe adopted a more hands-on approach. Humanity will have faith if they don't know what to have faith in.  \n\nAnd the changes were already visible. The tides have turned towards the better. \n\nEveryone at the Divine Protection Services knew that the Foster God was what Earth needed. But they also knew that God would return.\n\nAnd isn't that the most condemning thought any person who had faith could have? \n\n***\n [You can find more of my stories at r/iknowthisischeesy]\n\nAlso I apologise in advance.

                "Hello, We Hope This Letter Finds You Well.\n\nI am Yathinway from Divine Protection Services. This letter is to notify you that you have been removed from the care of God #424 in response to current allegations of neglect. We understand that not having a God is harrowing, so we have elected to provide a Foster God until you find your forever God.\n\nWe will be sending a followup in 9 business days regarding your assignment.\n\nThank you.\n\n\\----\n\nThe letter had to be a hoax didn't it? It had to- but how could it be?  8 billion letters mailed all at once. Slipped under every door, left in every crib and dropped in each mailbox. It was impossible.\n\nNo. It was divine.\n\nNobody knew what was coming in the days following the letter? Preachers assured their flocks that they were safe and that the letter was a lie. Doomers slipped underground into their bunkers to prepare for whatever was coming. Several Countries that had been relying on Religion to keep the peace fell into civil war.\n\nThere was nothing on the news, in conversation or people's minds aside from the letters. Nothing aside from the pending deadline.\n\nThe days bled by.\n\nSome started claiming that it was a meticulous viral marketing campaign. The same groups that preached conspiracies assured that this was the new chem-trails, that the elites of the world were trying to steal religion from the masses to reclaim Sunday. Though the Bezo's of the world might have loved a 6 day week, people had to admit that the logistics were impossible.\n\nMaybe it was a blessing that the letter arrived on the 8th day.\n\n\\-----\n\nThank you for your patience,\n\nI am Minithina, I've been assigned to your case. I am truly sorry to see the state of your society. Know that it isn't your fault and the lack of divine intervention has nothing to do with you, all of the blame lies with your God.  We are sorry for what has happened.\n\nWe know there is no replacing the God that you lost, but in the interim until the race: Humanity can find a new God, you have been placed in the care of Lolthinway. They are a retired God looking to settle down with an easy-to-manage population under 10 billion.\n\nI'm excited for you to meet them!\n\nMinithina, Your Divine Protection Agent\n\n\\-----\n\nYou would figure there would have been riots and panic in response to the letter, especially considering the turmoil around the first set,  but there wasn't time.\n\nThe sky flashed from blue to Lavender and the entire planet shot into daylight at the whims of the divine, and a saccharine voice echoed in everyone's ears.\n\n\"Oh my Goodness. You're so cute! Oh you're just perfect. So tiny and just adorable... one second I must have a-\" there was suddenly a cozy hand-knitted sweater on everyone who needed one, and a caramel candy in every other hand. \"There you go. It's been so long since I've had a population to take care of,\" it might have been a divine presence, but everyone felt the voice lean in. \"I might even spoil you a little bit. I'm so bad.\"\n\n\\-----\n\nDear Humanity\n\nWe are glad you have been enjoying your time in the care of Lolthinway. Your thank you prayers are appreciated and know that we take all feedback seriously at Divine Protection Services.\n\nWe have let Lolthinway know that you would like to stay with her as your forever God until you rise yourselves. She was ecstatic! We've sent her the papers and she will have officially adopted you soon,\n\nCongratulations,\n\nMinithina, Your Divine Protection Agent",
                "It was a chiming voice, so sweet and soft with the comfort of a warm blanket on a cool day that echoed throughout every being\u2019s mind.\r  \n\u201c***Hello. Oh, hello. Look at you, so beautiful. Even while broken, so resilient and beautiful. My poor beloved, my poor dears\u2026***\u201d It cooed, bringing many of the 8 billion people to their knees as they wept from the unconditional love that swept forth.\r  \nIt started some months ago with a telepathic message that was promptly dismissed by many high-level religious figures to be nothing but a hoax, nothing but a \u201ctest of faith.\u201d \u201cStay loyal, stay true, stay faithful\u201d was their slogan as the masses began to panic and look around for an answer; many people who turned from religion flocked back to the churches and the steeples to kneel and pray to show how devoted they were. To show that they never betrayed the one true God.\r  \nAlthough there were just as many, who stated that they were finally being heard, finally given an answer, they began to reconnect with the roots of what they knew was right, knowing that they were finally going to be taken care of. They tried their best to clean up the earth, reconnect with the soil, and took care of one another in the community as civilization slowly started to collapse and divide itself into two factions: those who Stayed Loyal, typically those of monotheistic religions, and those who Waited, those who were from polytheism religions or otherwise apathetic about God. \r  \nWith the discourse, messages began to appear in the form of letters, and graffiti art, taking over the broadcasted news and airwaves. \u201c*Thank you for your patience; you will be entrusted to the care of a foster god shortly.*\u201d Letting everyone know that what they heard wasn\u2019t a hoax and that it was real. Eventually, the Waited faction grew, but the Stayed Loyal remained the \u201cmost devoted\u201d and kept praying to be heard in a desperate attempt to reconnect with the original God(s) that they were subscribed to. \r  \nIt slowly started to feel different as the Divine Protection Service, DPS for short, began to do minor patches as humanity waited for their new god. It was only minor, though, as they stated they do not have the power of a real God to assist in any particular way, but they can at least ease the suffering in the short-term until the God is found and is given to them. Food was a main thing that people saw increasing, although it wasn\u2019t consistent. Water was another much to which many people rejoice, especially those going through severe draughts and forest fires. The DPS messages kept saying, wait for your new God to be given to you, and they will help even more. To some, DPS was already a God and couldn\u2019t believe that it could be better- could ***get*** better.\r  \nWhat a strange concept, many have whispered, that being Given a God was some right. Something they deserved. That they didn\u2019t have to fight for it truly. That was supposed to be something we had all the time. That we were born, made, and, as such, it was our divine right to have a God that loved and cared for us.\r  \n\u201c***It\u2019s okay my dears, let it out\u2026 It\u2019s okay to cry. It\u2019s okay to be angry. You have the right to feel that, my loves.***\u201d The voice soothed the hurt, the anger, the rage. It took the yelling as people screamed to the sky about how unfair it all was, how humanity has suffered for so long through floods, through the greed of those in power, through starvation and famine. Some of it was abuse, stating that they don\u2019t understand why, why now, it was so needed as they were abandoned for so long. Some shouted that they didn\u2019t even need a God anymore, pointing out incidents of when humans were able to triumph on their own.\r  \n\u201c***We are so sorry; we apologize so much for allowing this to happen to all of you. You are right; it\u2019s not fair. You did so much by yourselves though, look at you. Amazing. All of you just simply amazing. Even without a God, you achieved so much and tried so hard to keep it together. It\u2019s okay though, We are here now.***\u201d The voice soothed even further as it repaired the planet for the humans as they grieved. It cradled them in its warmth, holding them close even as they waved their fists in anger at it. It understood, after all, that they were hurt; they were oh so lonely for thousands if not hundreds of thousands to millions of years. To them, humanity was a hurt child who had to be resilient and survive for so long on their own. Their rage was understandable, and it couldn\u2019t even fault them for it.\r  \n\u201c***That\u2019s right. Let it out.***\u201d It cooed as it lessened the heat that was already frying the earth and the human\u2019s tempers, giving cool breezes that caressed away the tears, whether they be from pain, hope, or joy. It cleaned the waterways, allowing the humans to enjoy clean water, for some the first time in centuries. It repaired the damage from the earth, allowing plants and animals to spring back forth into nature, and slowly taught the humans about harmony with not only each other but with every living thing on Earth. \u201c***Even now, you are showing how brave you all are. There are so many changes. But look, you\u2019re adapting so well. My precious humans, adaptability is your perk, but you shouldn\u2019t have had to rely on just that for so long. Come, rest for a bit now. You deserve to. I'll take care of it all and once you are rested, we can learn together.***\"\r  \nEventually, they learned the name of this new god, Ahavah. The general consensus of every human  was that it suited it.\n\n\r  \n\u201c*We at Divine Protection Services wish to extend a formal apology to humanity as we have let you go under the radar for so long. It was not until we were reviewing old case files that we realized our error. As such, after reviewing incident reports and the prayers that we were given by you, we wanted to find a God that could best suit what you all needed. Please do give us more prayers if we are wrong, but what we found humanity needed was unconditional love.*\u201d",

                "The UN was the most neutral place to hold the panicked meeting.\n\nThe general concept was to hold it in Jerusalem but the mere mention of that suggestion caused riots.\n\nThe Pope, Dalai Lama, a number of high-ranking Imam, Rabbis, Monks, and leaders of Hindu religions had joined.\n\nAmong the gathering were even a few native tribes from the Americas and the Polynesians.\n\nTo my utter shock, I even spotted a few folks wearing pentacles on their well-pressed suits and dresses.  Were those Wiccians?  I suppose it was derivative of me to assume they'd be walking into such an event wearing floral decorations and headdresses.\n\nThere was a man who was rather smug, among the group.  He had a Pentagram on his lapel and glanced pridefully among the grouping of religious leaders.\n\nI couldn't recognize most, being an American reporter and an atheist myself, theology wasn't my strong suit.\n\nYet, here I was, covering a most insane story.\n\nThe Pope stood up, clearing his throat.  Before he could speak, a bright light filled the room.\n\nHovering above him, filling the room with holy light, was a strange creature.\n\nThey had four arms, and two sets of glowing eyes, each a different color.  One yellow, one blue, one red, and one brown.\n\nThree sets of shimmering white, gold, and silver wings hung off their back.  Their lower half was humanoid, but more like a horse.  Like a human-like centaur, of sorts.\n\nThey wore white robes over their upper body, their legs were clad in shimmering armor, and their feet (not hooves) were clad in armored boots.\n\nThey floated down slowly, \"**Sorry, My New Children, I was only just informed by DPS of the situation.  I rushed over to this plane as swiftly as I could and... oh... Oh, dear**.\" Their voice was both many and few, caring and disappointed.  \"**Oh, you've all split up already?  That's unfortunate.  Did you receive no prophets or miracles lately to guide you?\"**\n\nThe man wearing the Pentagram burst into laughter.\n\nThe deity before us gave a glare to the apparent Satanist, \"**I don't think that's called for, young man.\"**\n\nThe Satanist cleared his throat, giving a little chuckle, \"My apologies... It's just... Well, I've been saying God abandoned us for a long time.  It's funny to get proof.\"\n\nThe deity sighed, looking around the room, \"**Fair enough.  You're a rather astute prophet to notice.\"**\n\nThe Satanist covered his mouth, turning away so as to not offend.\n\nThe deity rolled their many eyes, \"**Anyway... Hello, my New Children.  I am the god Tirpheir.  I understand this is a difficult time for all of you, but I can assure you I'm a very experienced foster god.  I've seen many a neglected mortal plane, and ushered many into a better place.\"** They looked over the stunned group, \"**Though this is the most... dire case I've seen,\"** One of their fingers looked over the group, \"**Have any of you been granted exceptionally long life by your previous deity?\"**\n\nThe room was silent.\n\n\"**...Oh, uhm,\"** Tirpheir paused, \"**Any Avatars of the Divine's angelic choir?\"**\n\nMore silence.\n\n\"**Oh for the love of the grand combined essences-What was Yahweh doing for the last century!\"** Tirpheir called out in increasing frustration.\n\nThe Pope leaned forward, \"Actually, the last prophet we have ever received that was ever confirmed was about...\" The Pope heaved a heavy sigh, \"Was about 1500 years ago.\"\n\nAn Imam growled, \"Ah, so *Now* you accept that Mohammad was a prophet!\"\n\nThe Pope growled, \"Listen here, he was sent by Raphael, not God!\"\n\n\"And who commands the angels?!  Huh?!\" the Imam shouted.\n\nTirpheir lifted their hands, a heavenly sound of trumpets filling the room.\n\nAll were silent.\n\n\"**The Angel Raphael is who reached out to the DPS in the first place.  They stated they were befuddled by their last mission, as it fractured the religions and caused yet more divisiveness among the mortals here.  This, after yet more divisiveness was caused by a direct visitation of your Lord,\"** Tirpheir explained.\n\n\"AH-HAH!\" the Pope shouted, \"Jesus was the Lord!\"\n\n\"**Was,\"** Tirpheir emphasized, turning to the Pope, lifting a finger to their mouth, \"**Please be silent, while we transition.\"**\n\n\"I am only commanded by the Lord God, Jesus Christ, Hollowed be-\" The Pope began, but then choked, grabbing his throat as no sounds emerged.\n\nTirpheir's eyes narrowed on the Pope, \"**What we speak, becomes law.  Your refusal to be silent has robbed you of your voice,\"** They turned to us, \"**Going forward, there shall be some changes to stop all of these** ***Holy Wars*** **that you've begun,\"** Tirpheir looked towards the Israeli delegation, \"**Firstly, while we do not normally require sacrifices nor tribute, you're to destroy your old altars and artifacts.  They no longer have any spiritual significance, as your God has been egregiously absent.  Secondly, we shall select interim prophets and bless them with near-immortal life, and divine power,\"** They glanced at the Satanist and a few of the native leaders who had remained mostly silent, \"**Your sort seem more in tune with the spiritual world, so I shall select you, who saw the truth as the interim prophet of Law and Order.\"**\n\nThe moment the words were spoken, Satanist's pentagram glowed white and was replaced by four multi-colored eyes.  He smiled at first before he flinched, and gasped, falling to his knees as he grabbed at his own eyes.    He got to his feet, blinking a set of four human eyes on his head, looking around, \"Oh - Oh wow I can see it all and... Oh, it's a mess.\"\n\n\"**Yes, it is,\"** Tirpheir then pointed to a few of the natives, who experienced similar changes, \"**You shall be prophets of life, of Earth, of air, of Earth, and of Sea.\"**\n\nThe room was now full of confusion as the prophets were chosen.   I tried to write down all  I could.\n\nTirpheir turned to the Dalai Lama next, \"**You, who follow a kindred spirit through the ethereal plane and into the physical, shall be the new Prophet of Death and Rebirth.\"**\n\nThe Dalai Lama looked himself over, nothing changing.\n\n\"**Giving you ever-lasting life would, of course, be meaningless.  Your role will remain the same, but obviously, I shall be your patron.

                "There are a couple of reasons some religions have dietary restrictions. \n\nOne, restricting or allowing certain foods creates a sense of community, of specialness, and of identity. Dietary rules are part of crafting a unique identity that reinforces the devotion to the group. \n\nTwo, many of the kosher rules in Judaism, for example, were food safety/health related. Anything that eats trash, like pigs, or are bottom feeders like much shellfish, and the dietary rules originally were just general, more culturally widespread food safety rules. By retaining these rules while general culture shifted is again a marker of identity.\n\nThree, religions love to categorize things. Black and white. Good and bad. Some dietary rules (again in Judaism in particular). If your people are obeying dietary rules, you can generally expect they are following other rules of the faith.\n\nFour, commerce. There is the theory (and it has been a million years since I looked at this, so it may have more/less historical support than at the time I learned it) that the \"no meat on Fridays and during lent\" was basically a concession to fishmongers, who were important contributors to the Catholic church as the merchant class. No meat on Friday or during Lent guaranteed a certain amount of business for fishmongers.\n\nFive, natural resources. Cows are generally thought to be sacred in Hindu culture because cows are milk producing animals and are associated with sustenance and nurturing from mother nature. They were also associated with the Brahmin (priestly) caste, so it was considered an attack on the priestly caste. In India in particular, Hindus sought to differentiate themselves from Muslims. Again, part of community building and identity.\n\nIn my opinion, creating community and differentiating yourselves from other groups are the most significant factors.",

To ensure the continued viability of this export, they had to forbid their own people from consuming said livestock for themselves. If I'm correct, then early Jews would have raised pigs to export to surrounding cultures and as consequence, felt the need to make a religious law imploring abstinence from consumption. Presumably, that export practice eventually went out of favour yet the laws pertaining to the abstinence from pork ultimately remained.",

Poultry wasn't originally considered \"meat,\" but at some point rabbis changed it because there were times when poor people couldn't afford more than that but meat was suggested for certain celebrations or something... so even though a chicken's mother couldn't be a cow, they still couldn't mix meat and dairy... but mixing eggs and chickens is fine? As a vegan I think it's kinda ridiculous, but I like that Jewish scholars have a lot of debates and reasonings behind a lot of stuff. \n\nI once asked some Muslim outreach group on my college campus why they could mix meat and dairy when Jews could not, since kosher meat is considered halal, and they just told me \"God says it's OK for us\" ... not a great answer imo.\n\nJains and Buddhists being vegan is the only \"food\" restriction that makes sense to me.

Other religions also refrain from eating certain meats, fish, etc. due to the fact the locations they were originated from did not have sustainable methods of storing said food.

The taste of human flesh is also reported to be more like pork than any other common livestock flesh.

After time it was easily accepted into religion to deny that animal for consumption. \n\n\nBut you being an atheist you have no such obligation to follow these dietary laws;You can eat whatever you want and possibly out of respect/courtesy you don\u2019t bring the offensive food to the function or let the religious person know it\u2019s there so they can avoid it.",

I think shellfish can definitely go very bad but some fish are okay raw or preserved, so the whole rule about simply eating fish makes sense. Disgust also had a role to play in it, not that animals are pretty clean, but pigs do roll in their own filth.\n\nFor Eastern religions picking vegetarianism and fruititarianism, I think they just realized that animals suffer too and aim for limiting the suffering if the world, and I'd think the fruititarians realized plants are also alive so opt to only eat ones in a way that doesn't kill them.\n\nI'm not vegan btw, far from it, but it would seem pretty obvious that it causes less suffering to do so and if that is your highest goal, it would be a logical course of action.",

I KNOW what I have seen during my trips, I KNOW what resonated with me during and stayed after BUT when you see yourself as \"the devil\", when you don't feel like yourself, when your extremities and body parts feel foreign it is frightening. I fear that my shadow will come out and I won't be able to control it, like it will \"pilot my vessel\" and I will be its Shadow instead so I fight, I remind myself who I am in this life and I never surrender to the trip. I keep going back, trying to understand why this darkness is there, how to accept it and live with it but then I remember, I already do live in symbiosis with it, everyday.

IMO religion can be good and it can be bad, depending on the circumstances and religion in question.  People have 'found god' and it gave them the strength to get off drugs and fix their life.  But religious books also are subject to interpretation.  For instance it's my understanding that the The Quran itself does not anywhere say you get to kill, injure or directly punish gay people, only a later added hadith (edict) says that.  And The Quran has plenty of statements against murder and abuse.  Similarly it's not very clear on requirements for head and face covering for women, it more just talks about modesty.   And it certainly does not say that women should not drive cars!  Most of this current situation is more cultural than actually religious, IMO.  People often use religion as an excuse to do bad things while conveniently ignoring parts of holy texts that say NOT do do those things.",

Buddhism is a relatively new and therefore easy to understand idealogy. \n\nThe practicality of a God physically manifesting on Earth, this may be debated. \n\nBut surely some people had some life changing experiences. Maybe on drugs, maybe by meditation or some other forgotten phenomenon. They wrote about their experiences and defined a path for others to follow (maybe what made the most sense *that* time). Over time it became a religion. The same is probably true for Abrahamic religions and their texts. \n\nSure a few nuts cause riots, violence, terrorism. That's not religion. That's fanatism, power games and inflated egos operating under the garb of religion, knowingly or unknowingly.\n\nWe are in a golden age and have no obligations, except maybe personal, to follow any particular idealogy.

It is a legal fact that in other contexts, we do not view preferences or convenience or emotions--even if they are strongly held preferences and intense emotions--as a legitimate reason for killing other human beings. \n\nSo if non-religious people are morally scrupulous and really care about doing the right thing, many of them will come to the conclusion that abortion is morally impermissible. \n\nBut some people who reject religion adopt the attitude of \"there are no rules, so I'm gonna do whatever makes me happy!\" The pro-life movement would not survive a society filled with those kinds of nonreligious people.",
                "So I see two separate things here.\n\n1. To your actual question, the viewpoint that killing children in the womb is wrong not being separate from religion is like the viewpoint that theft, rape, and   violent crimes are bad not being separate from religion. Religions believe these are wrong, but it doesn't mean that it is solely a religious viewpoint. In this case, yes, it can sirvive.\n\n2. The other thing is that secularism certainly does increase the belief that killing children in the womb is okay. Now, google and other dictionaries will tell you that secularism is simply the separation of church and state, and the government treating all religions equally. This really isn't the case though. It may have been at one time, but it isn't now. Secularism is rejection of religion, which has ironically been taken to religious extent. It has litmus tests that you need to believe (abortion, transgender stuff, etc.), or else you are called a heretic (misogynist or any of the phobias) and are excommunicated (canceled). Their rejection of religion isn't just that they don't believe in God. So it has ironically become a religious belief in and of itself. Because of this, the vast majority of pro-abortionist won't listen to the arguements presented. I'm sure we have all seen it when they keep circling back to call you a misogynist. You might even be a woman. It makes no sense. It's because in their eyes, it means heretic against secularism, and heretics are bad. You shouldn't commune with them, or talk to them, and they need to be shouted down so nobody else can hear their blasphemy. This can be seen in other nations too, though the terms that really mean things like excommunication, heretic, etc change. It's why China has an extremely high abortion rate, because their version of this has been actively forced through by a dictatorial government.\n\nNow not everyone who is an atheist or a secularist is like that. But the dominant culture of secularism is.\n\nBecause of this, it honestly will be hard to wipe out abortion if there is no revival of religion in western nations.",
                "It can, if we change the religious image of the viewpoint. The arguments aren't religious anyway. Morality isn't borne from religion, religion is an expression of it.\n\nI believe it's more or less an intentional smear campaign that keeps the religious aspect front and center, because it's not cool atm.\n\nIf society is made aware of the real arguments, I firmly believe most will see reason.",
                "\"Outside\" religion, maybe.\n\n\"Without\" religion, no. Far too big a percentage of pro lifers are actively so because of their religious convictions, even if their arguments for being pro life aren't solely religious.",
                "I'll answer this question with another - what does religion have to do with it?  **The pro-life position is a civil rights position, namely that all human beings are persons.**\n\nWhile religion supports this belief and religious people are motivated by their faith to defend the weak, being pro-life is not the same as being religious. It's a strawman that pro-choicers use to try to reduce the right to life to someone's belief that cannot be forced on someone else.\n\n**Let me also ask a parallel question:** *Would the Civil Rights Movement have survived without religious people leading it?  Maybe, but it would be much weaker.*\n\nA number of religious figures led the movement - from abolitionists to the modern Movement led by **Reverend Dr Martn Luther King,** a Southern Baptist preacher who quoted Scripture in his speechs. Yet no one asks the question about \"religion\" when it comes the emancipation and full participation in society for Black persons because of the Civil Rights Movement.  MLK's statue is on the Mall in DC, is his contribution lessened by his faith? Manifestly not.\n\n[Consider this:](http://mrtomecko.weebly.com/uploads/1/3/2/9/13292665/religiousleadership.pdf)\n\n>A major reason for the movement\u2019s success was its religious leadership. The Reverends Martin Luther King Jr., Andrew Young, Fred Shuttlesworth, Wyatt T. Walker, Joseph Lowery, and Jesse Jackson were just a few of the gifted religious figures who played a national leadership role in the movement. In many instances black clergy became the spokespeople for campaigns articulating the grievances of black people, and they became the strategists who shaped the objectives and methods of the movement that sought to redress those grievances. Furthermore, they were able to win the allegiance of a large number of people and convince them to make great sacrifices for racial justice.\n\nFinally, people of faith have just as much right to enter the public square and speak/advocate as anyone else. Just because they're speaking from a point of view of Christianity or some other religion doesn't lessen the value of their speech. And, here's the important part, when making a philosophical or moral argument, people of faith don't automatically get \"points off\" because they practice a faith.",
                "I like to think that science actually, in a way, saved the pro-life movement. Almost any biologist, science textbook, and website will tell you that life begins in conception from a purely biological matter; if it weren't the case, then the pro-life movement would have died out just like the anti-same sex marriage did in the USA, except that much, MUCH quicker (somehow, as Americans weren't so supportive about it until recently). So yeah, it can survive outside religion, although it will struggle more than it does know, as most secular reasoning on the issue is based on either viability or consciousness, which ends up being a problem only until the ~20-24 weeks of gestation, obviously giving pro-choice a head-start.",
                "Probably not. And I say this as someone who is not religious. Most people who are against abortion are religious. People like myself exist but we're not the majority.",
                "Communist Albania strongly persecuted religion and restricted (but not completely outlawed) abortion, so yes. \n\nAlso, as feminism becomes estabilishment, future generations will turn against its controversial tenets.",
                "Yes, but probably not to the same degree",

                "Society itself couldn't survive outside of religion.\n\nPro-Choice folks are some of the most religious people I know. Many of them worship sexual promiscuity, violence, \"reproductive rights\", radical feminism, etc. Other secular religions revolve around money, celebrities, sports, political ideologies, etc. \n\nIncreasing secularization and disbelief in God can only go so far. It has created an environment that isn't conducive to procreation. Just look at birth rates of atheists vs. birth rates of people who believe in God and you'll see that the latter are more fit, from an evolution / natural selection standpoint.\n\nWe'll see an end to the prevailing trend and even a reversal at some point, perhaps sooner than you might think.",
                "I think it is likely. You don't have to be religious to be pro-life, but religious people tend to be more pro-life. I believe pretty much all countries that heavily restrict their band abortions have high religious populations.",

                "If it wants to succeed, it needs to become separate from religion (as in, the arguments and movement is secular, not that all pro-lifers are irreligious).",

                "No. The pl movement don't welcome nontraditional pro-life people, despite those pro-life people keep claiming to say the pl movement accepts diversity. Which is not true.",
                "If I'm being honest, the PL movement would diminish to a trickle outside religion. Secular societies don't accept any objective morals. They are governed entirely by relative morals that they agree upon. Since the preborn child doesn't get to advocate for itself, it seems probable that the personhood of the preborn child would be denied with no consideration for what makes us essentially human.",
                "Without God, everything is permissible.",
                "It might be able to survive without \u201creligion\u201d, but it can\u2019t survive apart from God. That\u2019s not to say that someone can\u2019t make morally right choices while denying God, but without a higher moral standard, a higher law beyond ourselves, each of us are a law to ourselves, and we must rely on the changing and often arbitrary beliefs and desires of other humans for the standard of right and wrong.  \n\nThankfully, as God says in His word, we are all made in His image, and have His law written on our hearts; and that\u2019s why we all know certain things are just wrong, like murder, though in people\u2019s sinful state, many have gotten quite good at ignoring and numbing their consciences.  We don\u2019t all know that things like rape, theft, and murder are wrong because of \u201cevolution\u201d; time plus chance and survival of the fittest did not and can not give anyone a sense of right and wrong.  That\u2019s our God-given conscience.    \n\nAnd to dig deeper into the question, the practice of \u201ctrue religion\u201d in the Christian vernacular (worshiping God in spirit and in truth, as He has revealed himself, and following His teachings), is necessary for having right knowledge of God, and a full knowledge and awareness of His law, rather than relying solely on our consciences and natural revelation, as we are tainted by sin and prone to error.  \n\nAlso of note, as it says in Romans 1, when people do not give thanks to God and give Him the glory due to Him alone, that\u2019s when they start turning away from Him, they deny the God that created them, putting created things in His place, and that\u2019s the beginning of their moral downfall.  Eventually God says He gives these people over to their sinful desires, He stops trying to hold them back via their conscience, and they become depraved.  Even though such people may do good deeds from a humanistic perspective, they are lost and blind to their own sin.  \n\nChristian pro-lifers then would do well to not separate arguments for the sanctity of life from God and His word, as that is the foundation upon which all morality rests, and is a perfect segue into the gospel.  Certainly point out and use logical and scientific arguments, but as a way to give credit to biblical arguments.  Point them to Jesus, Christian.  Don\u2019t listen to the pragmatists who tell you telling people about God or using biblical arguments turns them away; that\u2019s not you turning them away, that\u2019s their sin. What good does it do to save a human life when the soul is going to hell?  \n\nWe were given a great commission by the Lord Jesus Christ to share the gospel with *everyone*, so don\u2019t, in your fear and desire to please the unsaved, deny people what may be their only chance to hear the truth, as you will have to give an account for that one day.",

It asks you to do the impossible. Recognizes it is impossible, but still expects you to try. You can't just join you have to learn what you are committing to. You can't just hold onto your sins and say you are sorry and keep going. When I was investigating and discerning I told myself if there was a God, wouldn't he want us to try and be better?

The Catholic Schools I went to and the Catechesis I received were both very poor on top of a bio father who preached everything Catholic but physical and mentally abused my mother, his second wife, myself and my brothers.

Drugs, sex, porn, lying, stealing, cheating and everything in between. I started going to a local church near my work and just started praying on occasion. Then I began regularly attending Church but I was not ready/able to give up my vices and I yet again turned away from the Church. Some more years passed and I met my now fiance. One Sunday, after not attending mass in years, I had a gut feeling that I wanted to go. I asked my fiance, gf at the time, to come with, she'd never been to mass but attended a large nondenominational protestant church with her friends when she was young. After that we both started to get serious about the faith and then at midnight mass on Christmas I had a spiritual breakthrough/sign from God. Inside screamed at me to marry this woman in this very parish one day and to have children and raise my family Catholic. And that's  when we both came to the realization that although it's the hard path with rules that most denominations don't have to follow, it's the right way. The rules are there for a reason, if followed to the best of your ability, you will be truly happy in this mortal life. God will provide if you allow yourself to become a slave to His plan and will.

In my late teens to early twenties I started to research other beliefs and religions. I had this staunch atheist of a friend that helped me a lot in a way and he wasn\u2019t too happy when I came back to my faith and stopped talking to me all together. I mean, he got pretty upset as I was getting closer to the Church and would constantly send me things about the Church like from abuse scandals and corruption and almost every conversation we started to have it\u2019s like he\u2019d always have to touch the subject. Eventually he just stopped talking to me and I just let it be. In a way he did help me a lot though because he made me research the faith more. \n\nAnyway, but then I read the OT. Specifically the first 5 books or what the Jews call the Torah. And I said \u201coh man, Catholics are the only ones doing this.\u201d Cause modern day Judaism is just a different religion and Islam claims that all the OT prophets are Muslims and it\u2019s just a different religion honestly. So I thought the Priest, the Sacrifice, blood spilled on the altar when sacrifice happens, the confession to the Priest, and so forth. \n\nLeviticus 5:12 He shall bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take his handful of it as its memorial portion and offer it up in smoke on the altar, with the offerings of the LORD by fire: it is a sin offering. 13 In this way the priest will make atonement for them for any of these sins they have committed, and they will be forgiven. The rest of the offering will belong to the priest, as in the case of the grain offering.\u2019\u201d\n\nSo I found these books so interesting and I said to myself \u201cthis sounds like Catholicism\u201d.

I was raised nominally Presbyterian, but the idea of the reality of Christ was never taught, nor held in my family. While I always found the trappings of Catholicism attractive, I didn't hold any strong feelings either way towards its reality. As I got married and had kids, I felt increasingly strongly that I and my family were missing something important. So, I started to do research (I was a history undergrad at the time). The Church had aspects that I could not ignore: consistency in dogma and doctrine, the integration of faith and reason, the errors of her detractors, the insistence on sacred vs. profane, and the unwavering challenge of the historical reality of Jesus Christ. I asked a simple question of God - or rather made a heartfelt plea for guidance, and received a clear and rather direct response, that also gently reminded me that I'm not as smart as I like to think I am.\n\nAll of this and more convinced me that it was not only *my* religion, but the *one true* religion.",

I guess there is a God, but why do we need Jesus? Why do I need Jesus. I\u2019m not a bad person..\nAnd God answered me! He said that God is pure. And no matter how small a sin is, it cannot enter because it would defile the pureness. So we needed to be cleansed before entering heaven. \nSince my question was about Jesus, I understood it to be Jesus who was this \u201cfilter\u201d so to say. \n\nI did believe in God without a doubt from that day, but started going to a Lutheran church. Being Catholic never entered my mind until 9 years later. \nI was reading the catechism when I stumble over the concept of purgatory and I almost fell of my chair.

Controlling messaging in any way, regardless of the platform is also a danger to democracy. \n\nI think the Sam\u2019s position on covid is flawed because he straw mans the extreme case that wasn\u2019t happening. As covid evolved and the situation changed the messaging and sides stayed the same even though the situation on the ground changed. \n\nHis argument is \u201cdon\u2019t acknowledge the truth, because when we really encounter the situation, we\u2019ll be screwed\u201d.",

The Fremen had their own religion long before the BG altered it. This means the Fremen religion isn\u2019t substantially any more/less fake than any other. The changes were fairly specific\n2. The existence of *real* reverend mothers among the Fremen was entirely unknown to the BG, as was the ability to transfer ancestral memories. This means the Fremen \u201cpriesthood\u201d has resources that the BG never imagined. This means the \u201ccore\u201d religion is almost certainly different than the BG anticipated. It\u2019s entirely possible the Fremen RM\u2019s were aware of the changes made by the BG\n3. Pardot Kynes also muddled with the Fremen religion.

He sensed the future looking back at him out of dynasties not even dreamed.\n\n\\- Dune Messiah\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is the general conceit of the first two novels. Whether you call it a plot contrivance, plot hole or just accept it, the fact that Paul was not in Control of the Fremen despite his title saying so is the central tension of Dune and Dune:Messiah. The Fremen control their religion. The Fremen control the mystique of Muad'Dib.\n\nThe Story of Paul Muad'Dib the Fremen tell each other is stronger than Paul Atreides, the human. Religious fervor becomes beaurocracy becomes a brutal oppression.",
                "By the time he realized the jihad was inevitable, he also learned that he was the only one who could temper it down. If he\u2019d died earlier, or just disappeared and let the fremen do whatever, even more people would\u2019ve died. He never believed any of it himself, the fremen were a tool used to take revenge on the Emperor and the Harkonnens, only realizing too late what he\u2019d done.",
                "The religion you're speaking of essentially thought of Paul as a god, and no he did not believe himself a deity of any kind. Saying he \"accepted\" the jihad implies that he had some sort of agreement with it, he didn't ever want it, but rather failed to prevent it after beginning to see it as his prescience developed. There is a point in the first book where he realizes the future jihad is completely out of his control at this point unless he kills himself, his mother, and all the Fremen who are there helping them.\n\nAs for why he held onto his power, that is revealed in later books and becomes the centerpoint of the plot in many ways.",
                "Through the whole first book he\u2019s clearly stating that he\u2019s trying to stop the warrior religion. But sees later on that its inevitable because people by principal follow strong leaders no matter what. He lets him carry with the wind because he knows it\u2019s unstoppable. The emperor will fall, and everyone taking the emperor\u2019s side will be wiped out. Then\u2026. he has the opportunity to take the golden path, Leto II takes (his son). But Paul does not want to take the golden path because he\u2019s to afraid of it. Therefore, he cast himself into the desert, living a life, where he forsakes the path, and lets the world devour itself. It\u2019s like being able to see the future, and having the solution, but not daring to take the first step. Paul spread a fake religion, but he did it because he thought it would help his house to survive and bring peace to the galaxy.",
                "2 things, both of which are contradictory and elevate Dune from just a pretty cool sci-fi epic into a God-tier story:  \n\n\n1) As a lot of people point out here, Paul understands that his options are actually pretty limited. Characters in Dune have agency: they are not pre-destined to choose certain paths, and Paul sees multiple futures with his powers. At the same time, they are prisoners of history: they make their own choices, but those choices are limited by the decisions made by countless individuals in the past and present. We see that in Dune Messiah when Paul declines to pursue the Golden Path and walks into the desert to die. Does the Fremen religion fall apart? Nope! It lives on, and Leto II eventually takes his place. Again, this is not-preordained. It is one of many futures that could happen. But the sum total of futures available is limited by the world he lives in, so it's authenticity becomes irrelevant.  \n\n\n2) Also, the religion is kinda real! I feel like people overlook this all the time because as readers we are given knowledge of how manufactured it is, but despite the political, scientific, and cynical explanations of everything in the original trilogy the end result is that the Fremen religion is vindicated. Let's imagine you grow up around Fremen religious traditions, and you are taught that one day the Lisan al Gaib will appear from off world to deliver you from your enemies, put your people in power, and turn Arrakis into a paradise. One day you're abducted by the Bene Gesserit, who tell you everything that we as readers know, *and then you watch it all happen anyway.* I suspect that the average person in that situation would see Paul's existence and victory as validating the religion despite it's manufactured nature. I know I probably would. Shai-Hulud is great! God is great!",
                "Paul is aware of the history of the fremen religi\u00f3n and the BGs influence on it.\n\nWhether or not he \u201cknows it\u2019s fake\u201d depends more on what you consider to be a fake religion.",
                "Paul does know his religion is fake. That doesn't stop the fanaticism of his adherents. In the first Dune, Paul thinks the only time he could have stopped the jihad is by dying along with all the fremen in the cave they meet Janis and Stilgar for the first time. After that, the legions will carry out the jihad regardless of what Paul does.\n\nThis is because the fremen want Paul to be the Lisan Al-Gaib, and they interpret signs however they need to in order to fit the prophesy. Towards the end of the first book, there's a scene where the fremen make connections that aren't there about Lady Jessica to make the prophesy fit.\n\nIn Dune, power is like an animal, you can mount it, ride it, and even steer it. But it is still an animal, and it can disobey the rider, it can run so fast even the animal can't stop when it wants to, and that's why Paul cannot control his own religion. The best he can do is rely on his prescience to try and find the best course for humanity.",
                "Arthur C. Clarke famously said \"any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic\".\n\nThe bio-hacking, genetic manipulation, other memory, effects of spice and all the stuff to do with prescience etc. are, in universe, based on \"hard science\", they are facts.  But, to the great majority of unwashed trillions, taken altogether they must look like magic incarnate.\n\nSo, everything Paul can do and has done is within the scope of what his religion claims.  The accomplishments of Paul, the Bene Gesserit and the Tleilax are sufficiently advanced technology that is indistinguishable from magical prophecy unfolding from the pov of average destitute denizen of the known universe.\n\nIt's engineered, artificial, and curated but it does what it says it does.  I guess to paraphrase Obi Wan Kenobi, is it only fake \"from a certain point of view\"?",
                "Short answer - yes \n\nLong answer - his prescience saw the jihad in every future path he would take, the events of dune messiah are essentially damage control from the events from Dune. He knew about the MP and being the KH/LAG but that was a means to an end to survive and take revenge on the harkonnen\u2019s. I\u2019m leaving a lot out for spoiler reasons as I think messiah is one of my favourites in the series for that reason alone.

                "One thing I have not seen mentioned and I will just throw out there is that in part the Fremen religion helped them to survive, strict rules their society follows which helped them to survive in and was crafted in part by their very harsh environmental conditions. Conditions the initial \"Fremen\" would certainly not be prepared to thrive in.",
                "Paul knew the religion was a sham. Through his prescient abilities and mentat abilities, he knew the jihad and religion were going to grow whether or not he wanted it to, and the only way to keep the jihad from getting worse was to ride the wave and mitigate what he could. Paul laments how he has such little control despite his incredible power. Even his prescient abilities are as much a burden as they are help and he becomes a slave to the visions in a way. In the end of Dune Messiah, I think a major part in him walking into the desert is to escape the religion that ended up ruling him.",

                "Admittedly, it's a been while since I read Messiah and CoD, but it seems like the religion around Paul (and ultimately the religion that follows in the centuries venerating Leto II) -- are sorta just ontologically factual religions. I think you have your query reversed. Paul's religion is literally the first observably true religion complete with a living godhead with actual powers in the history of the universe! And Leto II is inarguably an immortal, near-omnipotent actual physical deity.\n\nSo for me the question isn't \"did Paul know the religion based around him was fake?\" is kinda nonsensical. The actual theme of the galactic jihad saga is how insane and horrifying it is for him for the cult around him to just be fully justified and rational, because he is an actual prescient deity and the prophesies about him are just true, no trickery, even though gene splicing and spice got him there. The Fremen worship shai hulud as the maker -- they're not wrong.\n\nI can't remember if the Fremen cult makes any claims about the afterlife or other metaphysics? Are there any unfalsifiable spiritual beliefs outside of the worms and lisan al-giab? (Pulled from the koran, etc.?)",
                "Yes, he absolutely knows that. They all do.",

Is your religion real when you fatten upon it?\"\n\n>!\"When I set out to lead humankind along my Golden Path, I promised them a lesson their bones would remember.

Look at what they do while I record these words. Hah! I give them enduring eons of enforced tranquility which plods on and on despite their every effort to escape into chaos.

Bringing this up regarding gods is a rhetorical trick because if I acknowledge that I can't prove it about gods, then the believer shouts Aha! and concludes it's reasonable to believe a god *might* exist and that god happens to be the god of their religion.\n\nThis is just a game where the believer never mentions the same trick can be used with *any inductive claim.*  It's universally known, to anyone who cares to check, as the [Problem of Induction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_induction).\n\nThink how stupid I would sound if I demanded that you prove that the Peanut Butter People don't exist.  Of course you can't prove it!  No one can prove any inductive claim with 100% certainty.  Does that mean it's reasonable to believe the Peanut Butter People exist and you must only make your sandwiches according to the commands of their holy book of bread spreads?  No, of course not.  The only thing that warrants belief is evidence, and the confidence level of the belief should match the reliability of the evidence.\n\nUsing rhetorical tricks to fool people who don't know about the Problem of Induction is the act of a salesman, not an educator or truth-seeker.

If this person proceeds to give me the runaround, saying that the island exists timelessly and immaterially and so it makes no sense to demand evidence, I'm going to feel less confident that they can be taken seriously. If this person goes a step way further, and insists that I actually *hate* this island, that I hold a religious belief that this island does not exist, and that it's my religious belief making me ask for proof - well, I have to be honest, that is going to absolutely confirm that this person isn't a serious interlocutor.\n\nThis is the sad state of apologetic arguments for theism.

If you say they need to prove God you miss the point.\n\nCan you prove that Narnia doesn't exist? If the answer is no, then does that mean it's not puerile to believe Narnia *does* exist? If you say it's on people who claim Narnia exists to prove that, then ~~you miss the point~~ you're absolutely right, because the burden of proof always lies with the positive claim. The evidence for any negative claim is always the absence of evidence for the positive claim. \n\nHow do you suggest we prove non-existence? What are you expecting to see, photographs of gods caught in the act of not existing? The only falsifiable prediction you can make about something that doesn't exist is that, as a consequence of its non-existence, there will be no sound reasoning or valid evidence which indicates it *does* exist - and that's exactly what we see in the case of gods, Narnia, and everything else that doesn't exist. \n\nWhen something is epistemically indistinguishable from things that don't exist, you're justified in concluding that it doesn't exist. You don't have to absolutely and infallibly rule out even the merest conceptual possibility that it *could* exist, nor does the inability to do so raise the idea to 50/50 equiprobability. \n\nLiterally everything that isn't a self refuting logical paradox is conceptually possible, including everything that isn't true and everything that doesn't exist. Appealing to ignorance and invoking the infinite mights and maybes of the unknown to establish nothing more than that we can't be absolutely 100% certain is not a valid argument - I could say the same thing about the possibility that there could be invisible and intangible leprechauns in my sock drawer. \n\n>if you can't prove nor disprove it's an unknown\n\nAgain, you can make this exact same argument to say it's \"unknown\" whether or not Hogwarts exists. You're laboring under the delusion that the inability to establish absolute and infallible 100% certainty means that something is 50/50 equiprobable. That's not true. We have overwhelming reason to dismiss the existence of gods, exactly the same way we have overwhelming reason to dismiss the existence of Wonderland. That the possibility can't be absolutely ruled out merely raises the probability imperceptibly higher than zero. \n\n>like Schrodinger's cat it's both possibilities until observed, thus saying that cat is dead or alive is a belief.\n\nIf anything that has a margin of error is a belief, then even gravity and the speed of light are \"beliefs.\" You're committing an all-or-nothing fallacy here, behaving as though all probabilities from 1% to 99% are equal to one another, simply because they're higher than 0% and less than 100%. \n\n>the atheist equivalent are the ones who just blindly hate religion asking for proof like a pack of seagulls\n\nNot proof, not in the absolute sense. Merely evidence. That there is none whatsoever is more than sufficient to dismiss the claim as false, again regardless of whether the most remote conceptual possibility can be absolutely ruled out. \n\nPretending it's unreasonable to require sound reasoning or valid evidence is absurd. Imagine if I told you there was an invisible and intangible dragon in my garage, and when you asked for evidence supporting my claim (since you surely would if you're not abjectly gullible and naive), I responded by saying you and everyone else who asks for evidence just hate dragons and behave like a pack of seagulls.

It is simply a rejection of the assertion that there are gods. Atheism is too often defined incorrectly as a belief system. To be clear: Atheism is not a disbelief in gods or a denial of gods; it is a lack of belief in gods.`\n\n`Older dictionaries define atheism as \u201ca belief that there is no God.\u201d Clearly, theistic influence taints these definitions. The fact that dictionaries define Atheism as \u201cthere is no God\u201d betrays the (mono)theistic influence.

Nope, the burden of proof is on the one that makes the claim. Atheists simply don't believe you. Let's illustrate this by the following conversation. We'll replace \"deities\" with another word to illustrate what the atheist position actually is:\n\n*Theist: I own a custom Ferrari!*\n\n*Atheist: I don't believe you. Show me.*\n\n*Theist: Sure I do. Here <dangles keys on a Ferrari logo key ring>.*\n\n*Atheist: that doesn't prove you own a custom Ferrari. I can buy that key ring in any gas station. Show me the car.*\n\n*Theist: I can't show you the car because it's invisible. It only shows itself when you already have faith it exists.*\n\n*Atheist: Then you have given me no reason to believe you.*\n\nSo the atheist position is one of suspended belief until the theist has met his/her burden of proof.

This is hardly applicable here. We have millions of scientific experiments and volumes of evidence that explain reality without assuming gods are behind it is even necessary.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I know there are religious people out there who are nuts buts I'll argue the atheist equivalent are the ones who just blindly hate religion asking for proof like a pack of seagulls. \n\nLet me ask you this, and be honest:\n\n*If you are sick, are you going to a doctor in medicine or to a faith healer?*\n\n*If you take a flight, do you want your pilot to be someone who studied aerodynamics and meteorology, or would you prefer an airline where pilots are priests?*\n\nYou yourself are asking for evidence in every other aspect of your life.

Again, there is overlap, but that diagram is not a circle, and the categories are not interchangeable.\n\n>But can you prove it?\n\nThat's an appropriate thing to ask a person making a factual claim. Anyone stating, \"there is not/cannot be a god,\" has the exact same burden of proof as anyone stating, \"there is/must be a god.\" It is on the speaker to produce a body of compelling scientific evidence to establish the veracity of the claim.\n\n>If you say they need to prove God you miss the point. That point being if you can't prove nor disprove it's an unknown.\n\nThat's correct. If a thing doesn't have a sufficient body of compelling scientific evidence, it's not considered fact. The state of, \"welp, I don't have a sufficient body of compelling scientific evidence, so I'm not convinced,\" is atheism.\n\nThe issue in that arena is that there are ppl who are making claims. When a person says, \"god exists,\" that's a factual claim. They are saying that the existence of god is an established fact. The appropriate response to any claim is, \"pls show me your data.\" That's what we do with literally everything else, and it's what we do with that specific claim. Making a claim is taking on burden of proof. *That* is the point. \n\n>I know there are religious people out there who are nuts\n\nThat isn't relevant wrt atheism. Atheism is about scientific knowledge.\n\n>I'll argue the atheist equivalent are the ones who just blindly hate religion\n\nPpl who hate religion generally have reasons.

Do you require evidence to disprove unicorns and leprauchauns before you choose not to believe? Or do you simply default to not believing in them, assuming you'd reconsider if you ever saw evidence? Why would you assess god-claims with an epistemic standard that's different from the way you'd justify any other belief?\n\n> But like Schr\u00f6dinger's cat...\n\nIt's not; it isn't like Schr\u00f6dinger's cat **at all.** You've either misunderstood the thought experiment or the concept of superpositions or both. It's simply an analogy to describe waveform-collapse in familiar terms to lay-people. It has nothing to do with the concept of unknowns themself. The process *would not* work with an actual cat in an actual box and the question whether there is or is not a god in the universe does not represent a state of superposition. This is simply descriptive of the position of particles before and after observation. Further, the word \"observer\" in particle physics does not describe the anthropocentric observation of a human, though it can. An observer is simply anything that detects or interacts with a quantum particle. It can be on the back if your retina or in a solar panel, releasing an electron when sufficiently energized. Even moreso, the concept of an obsever is such that the observer becomes part of the system itself and can effect the outcome. Are you saying us humans can affect the outcome of if there is a god or not? I thought not. Quantum physics can be pretty strange, but if I flipped a coin and no one looked at it, it would not be in a superposition; it is *either* heads or tails. Even while flipping through the air, it is not in a superposition; with a deep enough understanding and accurate instruments, you could predict it mid-air or even call the flip before performing it. As far as I can tell the same is true of your god; it either is or is not real, and we can't influence that. \n\nGetting a bit tired of seeing theists invoke quatum physics as if it were magic just because it goes over their head.

Most atheists simply lack a belief in God - in other words, theists claim \"God exists\" and atheists say \"I am not convinced.\" We are not claiming that we are 100% sure that God does not exist; we're simply saying that none of the evidence theists have provided re: the existence of God is convincing, and so we don't believe the claim. It's not really much different from me claiming you owe me a million dollars and then producing a rack of witnesses (who you don't know and have never seen us interact) to tell stories to support that claim.\n\nThat said, there are some positive atheists who claim to know that God doesn't exist. That's still not the same as a religion.\n\nFirst of all, your Schrodinger's cat reference doesn't apply here. You seem to be implying that if two possibilities exist and we can't prove or disprove either one of them, that means we should treat them as if they are equally likely. But that's silly, and not a concept that we apply to *anything else* in life. Some things are more likely than others! To date, no one has produced compelling empirical evidence that an all-powerful, all-knowing creator god (or a deity of any time) has affected the real world in any demonstrable way; in fact, much historical, archaeological, and scientific evidence actually contradicts the claims of modern world religions in a way that is not explicable by adherents. If there's no evidence of God and a lot of evidence against God, which is the more likely outcome?\n\nSecond of all, this distorts the way that humans use language. Pick a country that you've never visited. You haven't been there to confirm its existence, but you \"know\" it exists, right? Because others have done things to confirm that country's existence and show evidence it is there. Or take another mythical creature - you know unicorns don't exist, right?

There are lots of theists, but they don't all belong to the same religion - I don't lump Christians in with Hindus or Muslims, even though they all believe in deities (probably). Religion is about ritual, practice, a shared set of intertwining myths and stories, behavior, and culture.

Literally everything you say in the following paragraph hinges on this and you're just wrong, whether the ignorance is honest or wilful is unclear. Atheism is a lack of belief in theistic claims about the existence of god or gods. Period. There is no antitheist requirement for this, not believing someone's claim about their god is not the same as claiming the opposite and this is just simple propositional logic. Be more honest about what atheism actually is if you care about having good conversations, and that includes simply accepting it when an atheist tells you they jusy don't believe the claim. \n\n\n>I know there are religious people out there who are nuts buts I'll argue the atheist equivalent are the ones who just blindly hate religion asking for proof like a pack of seagulls.\n\nI have never met a single atheist, or even a believer who hates the church, who just blindly hates religion. They all have reasons and if you pull your fingers out of your ears they will gladly tell you those reasons. If you make a claim that X is true, you have adopted a burden of proof and have no right to be irritated when people hold you to that.

Moreover, I am convinced most of them are logically impossible. \n\n>But can you prove it? \n\nProve what? That your specific definition of 'God' doesn't in fact exist? That's quite absurd. It's not my (or anyone's) job to disprove things. It's on you (all/any theists) to actually show it does (or even can) exist. \n\n>If you say they need to prove God you miss the point. \n\nWhat point? \n\n>That point being if you can't prove nor disprove it's an unknown. \n\nAh, this is apparently the \"point.\" If it's unfalsifiable then there is, by definition, no good reason to accept it as true. Well done refuting your own beliefs.\n\n>To say it's this way or that way is a belief of what the unknown should be. But like Schrodinger's cat it's both possibilities until observed, thus saying that cat is dead or alive is a belief.\n\nIgnoring the obvious failure of understanding with this analogy you have, that's why most atheists lack belief in your deity. Because without evidence there is no valid reason for belief. \n\n>I know there are religious people out there who are nuts buts I'll argue the atheist equivalent are the ones who just blindly hate religion asking for proof like a pack of seagulls. Not all are like this but I do see them every now and than.\n\nSure. But I have very good, evidential reasons to hate many religions. And some of the same to be disdainful of many religious adherents as well.",
                ">All atheism is just anti-thiests.\n\nI'm an atheist without any anti-theistic tendencies, thus debunking this assertion. \n\n>The belief that there is nothing we call God. But can you prove it? \n\nNot atheism. Atheism is the state of being unconvinced by God claims. Nothing more. You can call anything you want God without it being necessarily true. It's up to YOU to prove your claim. \n\n>If you say they need to prove God you miss the point. \n\nProof is for math. What I need as a rational skeptic is compelling evidence for any such claims. Given no theist has provided such compelling evidence at this time, my natural response os incredulity. \n\n>That point being if you can't prove nor disprove it's an unknown. \n\nDepends. Some theists are deists and their god clam is are rather vague. Others claim to know something about the god they claim exists. Again, the onus is on them to demonstrate the claim. \n\n>To say it's this way or that way is a belief of what the unknown should be. But like Schrodinger's cat it's both possibilities until observed, thus saying that cat is dead or alive is a belief.\r\n\nWe can apply your logic to any claims.

Not all are like this but I do see them every now and then.\n\nI don't hate religion so this assertion is debunked. I think people who pretend to know things without evidence in the name of religion are incorrect and using poor epistemology but no hatred.  I do hate some actions some religious people perform in the name of their God (9/11, Inquisitions, etc.) much in the way I hate the actions of some non-religious dogmatists like Stalin's purges.  \n\nAlso, it's Flock of Seagulls:  \"I Ran\" is an amazing song, BTW.",
                ">That point being if you can't prove nor disprove it's an unknown.\n\nThis is how we can tell you are both brainwashed and dishonest:\n\nProve to me that you won't win the lottery. You can't. So why aren't you acting like you're going to win the lottery? They're two options that are both unprovable so they must be equally valid, right? So why haven't you chosen one and based your whole life on it?\n\nYou know that acting like you won't is how you should act. That's how I know you're willing to be duplicitous to protect a label that you associate with\n\n>I know there are religious people out there who are nuts\n\nHaving an imaginary friend is nuts. Believing that voice in your head to be God is dangerous. And that is written in the Bible: \"They show that the work of the law is written on their hearts, while their conscience also bears witness, and their conflicting thoughts accuse or even excuse them\"",
                "No, not all atheists are anti-theists, but the burden will always lie on the ones making the claim. I'm happy to leave the religious alone and for them to have their beliefs, because I recognize it's futile to try to convince them there isn't good evidence for their beliefs. The true problem is that the religious can't leave us alone. They are constantly trying to push their beliefs on others, push them into public law, onto our children, into science....and that's why so many atheists fight back, is because of the constant encroachment into public spaces. You never see atheists on street corners preaching at people that they are wrong...you only see the religious preaching that they are right and if you don't agree with them you are going to hell.\n\nSaying I can't \"disprove something\" as a reason to keep believing is absurd. It's like saying, \"If you can't disprove that I have an invisible pet dragon...then I'm justified in believing it!\" It's impossible for me to disprove the existence of something....that has never been proven to exist to begin with and has no testable properties. \n\nLastly, saying atheism is practically a religion is just silly. Religion describes a system of beliefs, usually around a central figure, usually with a central holy book. Atheism is the exact opposite of this. Calling atheism a religion is like calling abstinence a sex position."

Pre-marital sex is a sin like any other, and we\u2019ve all sinned in some way. That doesn\u2019t mean we should seek to sin or just say \u201cforget it\u201d, but if someone recognizes their sin is wrong, seeks forgiveness, and changes, then from a religious standpoint, they\u2019re no different from someone who has never committed that particular sin.

                "I went to my aunts wedding in Alabama a few months back. This side of the family is pretty religious. My family is not. One person talked about god with us for a while. My favorite part was when he said, and I quote \u201cwere pretty comfortable but I\u2019ve been saving up. I had been thinking about a vacation but decided not to in favor of other things. Then, god himself spoke to me and said \u201ctake that cruise, you deserve it\u201d\u201d\u2026 anyways he spent most of that time trying to convert my dad and convince him that they found where the garden of eden was and that it\u2019s a real place. Also sent him a letter in the mail a week later. That was a wild letter, full of grammatical and spelling errors. Interacting with religious people can be a wild ride",

In actuality, they've just hurt a child, but a true believer's connection to the reality of suffering is glancing at best.",

I sent missionaries along with my armies to attack \u2014 that +10 bonus is huge, especially before I caught up in tech. Also converting a city you\u2019re at war with is good for +2 era score so it was easy to maintain golden ages, which was very useful for staving off loyalty issues in the cities I conquered.",

The only interesting thing about the religious units is the promotions you can get for Apostles, and guess what, all of the fun ones have nothing to do with your goal for religious victory!

                "Religion hinders your ancient era quite a bit, on deity, because in order to get any good beliefs you'll need to rush it to beat the AI; however, there are plenty of benefits to having a religion that don't lend itself into religious victory. \n\nThe most basic combo is taking feed the world which makes all your shrine and temple buildings provide food and housing, and then taking either of the beliefs that give science/gold/culture per city/4 followers of the religion. This works together because it is easier to grow bigger cities, thus generating more science and culture from your religion. \n\nAnother combo is taking any pantheon that gives faith adjacency to your holy sites, and then taking work ethic that gives production equal to the adjacency bonus, and finally slotting in the card to receive 100% faith adjacency bonuses. These work exceptionally well for maps with large amounts of desert or tundra, or for any map where you spawn with a decently large amount of rainforest. \n\nFor culture victory specifically a faith economy is really powerful, seeing as most of your end game units can't be purchased or produced without faith. It's significantly less prominent than science, but if you take the grand masters chapel to be able to purchase military units with faith it can be exceptional for a domination victory. Similarly the Byzantium civ benefits heavily from a religion but their main victory type is domination, taking the crusade belief which gives combat strength while fighting in foreign civ borders that follow your religion.",

That unlocks Preserve and further botches you District Discounts.\n\nOther noteworthy issues: Beliefs that might require you to actively spread your religion, which takes a while to \"refund\" the cost of the missionary. Giving Philip II +5 Combat Strength against you. Giving any other civ that has a religion +4 combat strength against you if they have a stronger culture and unlock Reformed Church first.\n\n\nIn singleplayer higher difficulties the AI cheats outrageously to unlock religions before you do so I recommend aiming for the 3/4th spot to have a decent belief remaining, not more, and to unlock that later after other priorities are covered",

If you do this right you can easily buy 1 even 2 settlers a turn.\n* Workers anthem + adjacency bonus cards are insane.  You can have 30-50 production cities in the ancient/classic era.\n\nThere are some insane combos with the above.  Peter is the most notable.  With dance of aurora + his unique district that gives 50% production cost reduction + workers pantheon.  You can beat deity and it will feel like you are playing against settler difficulty, if done right.\n\nI ignored faith like you, but once I figured out how to utilize it it's very very strong.

                "I don't completely ignore it - depends on the game. Culture games can be quite dependent on faith, that if I'm going to be building holy sites for the faith generation, might as well make the thing worth a damn. Better that than be at the whimsy of the AI. I find that if you're only planning on being defensive with the religion, it's not too hard - just save the first Debater you pull for when you need him and launch an inquisition to have inquisitors take care of the rest. Maybe convert a target of opportunity for the same religion opinion bonus if they're nearby and don't have one, but mostly just keep to my own cities and get a religious alliance with anyone that has enough passive pressure to threaten (since culture games tend to be more diplomatic anyway)\n\nScience or domination games, it's very rare unless you get one of those blue moon games there are fewer than expected religious civs in the game, and I can sneak off a Work Ethic with little investment (because why not get more production). But 95% of the time, in science games I'd rather plop a campus down where you'd put a holy site and in domination games, I'd rather not have the headache of having to sweep in my religion behind my troops to not lose loyalty in domination games. There are exceptions (especially in Arabia and Byzantium's case) but definitely a much lower concern.\n\nReligious victories? Definitely need to be tweaked. The apostle promotion system is so borked that it feels like rolling the dice on whether the unit is even useful. It feels like you need Yerevan in the game just so you're not tearing your hair out because you need a Debater or at least a Proselytizer and getting bugger all. \n\nI never disable it (especially since the AI has actually threatened me with it before, because spamming apostles is something even their basic brains can figure out), but it is exceedingly rare for me to ever go for it.",

If you have this City State in game, Suz them. You can faith buy your city center buildings and encampment buildings. \n\n* Naturalist. If you are going for a culture victory building national parks is a must, and keeping a section of your civ devoted to preserves and parks will help you achieve this. It's not a lot of faith you'll need but you'll need a few of them usually. \n\n* Moksha. Faith Buy your districts! I'll even sometimes move him around and build things I wouldn't have otherwise focused on in my cities. \n\n* Great People. Don't forget you can Faith Buy great people! Keep an eye on who's coming, and if there's. Good one you might need faith buy him! Also end of an Era, one point away from Golden? Che k to see if you can faith buy a great person! \n\n* Religion. You might not want to win by it, but they are powerful aspects to the game. You get Era points for founding them and completing them. You also get buildings that boost your play style. I like Synagogue and get a big boost to faith per turn so I can do everything else listed above, but you can get culture, science, food, production, housing, amenities all for free!. You can even faith buy those buildings once you got a temple! Going war? Conquest! Send apostles with your army and convert cities while you attack with a huge bonus! Sometimes your apostles will even get the healer upgrade! Building a lot of wonders? There's a religion that will make them worth even more! Going culture victory? Reliqories (probably spelled that wrong)! Free tourism! \n\nThe point is - don't ignore your faith and religion.

                ">the three holiest people in your religion?\n\nJudaism has a well-developed sense of the holy, but it doesn't rank people by degrees of \"holiness.\" Hence the idea that there is a ranking, and three persons can be selected as \"holiest,\" is foreign to Judaism. The misunderstanding may come from the Christian concept of a \"saint.\" Judaism has no official saints and no mechanism for naming or proclaiming them. Or any desire to do so, I might add.\n\nIn Judaism, holiness (kedusha) is an aspect of God. We know God is holy, as the prophet tells us:  \u201cHoly, holy, holy is the LORD of hosts, the whole earth is full of his glory\u201d (Is. 6:3) Things pertaining to God partake of this holiness, like his name, his temple, the vessels used to serve him, the Torah scroll, books containing his name, sacrifices dedicated to him, days he has designated as holy (Sabbaths and festivals), the land of Israel and Jerusalem.\n\nPeople are not holy in that sense in Judaism. As God's creations, they are worthy and deserving respect. They may be righteous (by their deeds), they may be wise, learned in the Torah, charitable and just. But they are always flesh and blood, in that sense, human, neither divine, angelic or holy.\n\nThat said, the Jewish people is said to be a \"holy people\" and commanded to be holy, as we read in Lev. chap. 19: \"And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying: Speak to the entire congregation of the children of Israel, and say to them, You shall be holy, for I, the Lord, your God, am holy.\" What follows? A list of commandments, beginning, \"Every man shall fear his mother and his father, and you shall observe My Sabbaths. I am the Lord, your God. You shall not turn to worthless idols...\"\n\nSo we see two things: (1) holiness is a collective concept, that applies to the entire community of Israel -- because Israel pertains to God (see above); and (2) as individuals, they belong to this holy congregation by virtue of their observing God's commandments.\n\nMoses was not holy; he was the greatest of the prophets. I am not sure I know of any Jewish source that says he was holy. Same with the patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and the prophets.\n\nNow from time to time we encounter a rabbi who was called \"holy.\" An example is Rabbi Judah Ha-Nasi (2nd cent. CE) who is also called \"Rabbenu HaKadosh,\" our Holy Rabbi. You can be sure this is an honorific, a title of respect, conferred and used unofficially, and not making him \"holy\" (kadosh) in the sense discussed above. This is why the Jewish folks here can't give a definitive list of \"the 3 holiest\" -- such a list could never be prepared within the Jewish tradition.",
                "That extremely hard and quite frankly there's probably no single person who is holiest.

There is a long line of Hindu nationalists who have given root to this idea since the 1800s. The same people the bjp says are the best Indians while also denigrating Gandhi, nehru, Muslims for 'splitting India into two' when their own leaders they worship were much more eager to have two separate countries. \n\nJinnah was also more educated and more progressive than anyone in the bjp today lol.

                "If you consider Hindu as a religious term, you have already lost your way. By creating a \u201cHindu\u201d religion as a monolithic ideology (which they have defined it as all religions native to India and non-Abrahamic), the British managed to divide the natives into \u201cHindus\u201d, Muslims, Christians and others. Our national leaders drafted our constitution with the same definition so that we continue to divide ad infinitum. \n\nThis helped all politicians to make gains - Congress and Communists went after \u201csecular\u201d policies by giving the Muslims and Christians a lot of privileges for vote banks. They knew the others are divided along other seismic lines like language, Jati, class, elite aristocrats, urban, rural and so on. So a sizable percentage in their population will always vote for or against them. This way they continued to rule using the various cracks to keep people divided, with periodic dosage of \u201cincentives\u201d like freebies, caste quotas, waqf laws and so on. They knew people had no alternative and continued to plunder the country as they wished. Adopting the socialist model of economy helped them tremendously, where they kept the radio, Television , print media, academia etc. firmly under their control. \n\nThis is when the Nationalists (who did not align with Gandhi and Congress party ideals) slowly began to rise from the fringes. If Congress and Communist parties could use religious appeasement as a vote bank and call it secularism, the Nationalists asked why they cannot take the others who were pushed into second class status as a vote bank and make gains on it.\n\nRealize that all are politicians. They need something to divide the people. The Nationalists morphed into the BJP and are banking on the non Abrahamics (who are framed as Hindus) to come to power. If Congress can use one side of the divide, why should people object to the BJP using the other side of the divide?\n\nAll this talk of secularism, liberalism, fascism etc. are just talk. While people align themselves with different sides based on what kind of filters they are wearing, the politicians are making a kill.\n\nWhether you elect the BJP or TMC or Congress or whatever party, the end result for the people will always be the same. Each party will try to derail the efforts of the other by setting off fires and many would perish in that. The smart ones know the drill and duck under the table until all becomes quiet again. Both sides are working hard to make India convert to one of the Abrahamic religions in the long run."

In some other faiths, continuity of the individual is assured by reincarnation until the point is reached at which the preservation of individuality is no longer seen as of any importance. It is not surprising that people cling so tightly to belief systems which reassure and support them so effectively. . . .  But some of us cannot adopt a faith just because it may be psychologically desirable for us to believe: we need some evidence that it is true. Life is not meaningless to those who live it to the full, even if they do not believe in the immortality of the soul.\n\nStorr, who was a psychiatrist, also notes that people who lose their faith, like Freud and Jung, sometimes adopt belief systems that are just as irrational and dogmatic as religious beliefs.\n\n>Experimental psychologists, for the most part, do not feel the need to believe in anything other than science; but experimental psychologists are only a tiny fraction of mankind.\n\nWe can hope that religions become more tolerant and humane, but I doubt we'll ever be free of irrational belief systems.",

When Omar ibn Al-Khatab saw Hafsa visiting him, he asked her what she was doing here. She stated that the prophet said he called on her. Omar denied this and knew immediately what the prophet was up to and commanded that his daughter get back to her husband immediately. When she got back home, she caught prophet Mohandjob in bed with Maria and flipped out. She raised hell, but he dismissed her. So she went to Aisha and told her everything. Aisha became furious and confronted him. Mohumpdead claimed he was within his rights, and so went on strike forbidding all his wives from their marital beds. After a month, a verse came down \"exonerating\" him of any wrongdoing and obligating wives to fulfill the duties to their husbands. It's bc of his infidelity that women in Islam are now coerced/forced into sex (aka rape). This also created a contradiction in the Quran against fornication outside of marriage, since the prophet wasn't admonished for this haraam.

(33.51) I said (to the Prophet), \"I feel that your Lord hastens in fulfilling your wishes and desires.\"\n\nShe knew he was full of it, but she wasn't dumb enough to exit the religion, especially with prophet Moharddung killing apostates and \"traitors\".

Although most human societies have had something we'd call a religion, very few of them have dreamt up an afterlife to pretend our mortality doesn't exist. If - and, hopefully, when - we free ourselves as a species from deceiving ourselves with our myths, we'll find other ways to cope with mortality.

                "This is something I struggled with as I was \u201cdeconstructing\u201d. I grew up surrounded by the Christian belief system being the norm and, after conversion, spent 30 years as a full-on believer. During my deconstruction, I remember saying to my daughter that I was actually less afraid of Hell than I was of just nothingness\u2026 ceasing to exist.\n\nI remember later on, one of the books I was reading talking about death\u2026 about ceasing to exist. It talked above the billions of years prior to our births. We didn\u2019t know we didn\u2019t exist. We don\u2019t remember it. We didn\u2019t care. We couldn\u2019t because we just WEREN\u2019T\u2026 we didn\u2019t exist. After death is the same. You just AREN\u2019T. You won\u2019t care, you won\u2019t know it, it\u2019s just lights out. This is actually quite comforting and I no longer fear death to the same extent as when I was a believer in an afterlife (even considering the fact that I believed I was on the \u201cright side\u201d and going to the good place). Honestly, it makes far more sense than there being an afterlife. \n\nThat being said, if there should actually be an afterlife, I am also convinced that it\u2019s not the one described by Christianity. My studies into the Bible\u2019s ACTUAL origins through Bart Ehrman\u2019s books has shown me that it\u2019s not something to be trusted as factual in any kind of way. That, combined with 50 years of experience has shown me that I never experienced anything whatsoever to support it being true, apart from a book with dubious origins making the claims and telling me that it was its own proof. \n\nI think fear of death keeps people in religion, but I think plain old superstition is still a strong force in the human species.

Dead matter gives life to bacteria.\n3. Summer. Everything that dies gives birth to new life.\n4. Autumn. Not everything that dies gives new life. Like industrial waste.\n\nFrom the point of view of the concept of god, that god is all the situations around. It is wrong to focus only on #3 in the eternal cycle. When death is completely denied. And this is where the deception takes place. When people don't consider #1, #2, #3 and #4 equally in the matter of death. It is a big deceit to consider the seasons to be only from summer as at the equator. Such a concept is purely mathematically defective."

            "selftext": "This is quoted from the post by the scientist who claimed to be researching the biology of the alien. Only the religion part.\n\n\nQuestion 3:  I havent read everything in detail but can you expend on the document on their religion? \n\nEBOs believe that the soul is not an extension of the individual, but rather a fundamental characteristic of nature that expresses itself as a field, not unlike gravity. In the presence of life, this field acquires complexity, resulting in negative entropy if that makes sense. This gain in complexity is directly correlated with the concentration of living organisms in a given location. With time, and with the right conditions, life in turn becomes more complex until the appearance of sentient life. After reaching this threshold, the field begins to express itself through these sentient beings, forming what we call the soul. Through their life experiences, sentient beings will in turn influence the field in a sort of positive feedback loop. This in turn further accelerates the complexity of the field. Eventually, when the field reaches a \"critical mass\", there will be a sort of apotheosis. It's not clear what this means in practical terms, but this quest for apotheosis seems to be the EBOs main motivation. \n\nThe author of the document added his reflections and interpretations as an appendix. He specified that, for them, the soul field is not a belief but an obvious truth.  He also argues that the soul loses its individuality after death, but that memory and experience persist as part of the field. This fact would influence the philosophy and culture of EBOs, resulting in a society that doesn't fear death but which places no importance or reverence on individuality. This \"belief\" compels them to seed life, shape it, nurture it, monitor it and influence it for the ultimate purpose of creating this apotheosis. Paradoxically, they have little or no respect for an individual's well-being.\n\n Please be advised that I'm speaking from memory of something I read more than 10 years ago, so take the following with a grain of salt. Also, I'm not a philosopher or an artist, so please excuse my struggle to properly formulate the concepts and my dry terminology. Finally, note that this information comes from a document whose author was directly interacting with an EBO. It is not specified whether it was an ambassador, a crash survivor, a prisoner. The means of communication were not specified either.",

When you 'die' or 'melt', you wonder if there is a heavenly refrigerator where all the ice go, and remain as ice forever, eternally.\n\nWe know this is ridiculous of course. When ice 'dies', it simply becomes water. There is *nothing* to mourn. It has simply reverted to water. And yes, we still will miss the ice cube nonetheless.\n\nI've had this shower thought for a while. Reading this post, it makes me wonder..",
                "This is all total conjecture, but I have a working theory based on a deep hunch and lots of overlapping literature, ancient and recent:\n\nI think these particular beings' religion is incomplete (as are all religions), which is why they are stuck, unable to pregress and are therefore obsessed with us. I think they understand that we seem to reincarnate naturally somehow, but they do not fully understand how or why. I think they are unable to parse or penetrate the field beyond the superficial. While our souls seem to coelesce in this space around our bodies - seemingly out of the raw aether - it is more like seeing someone rise out of an opaque pool of water and assuming that we are being formed at the surface itself. In reality, we arise from and return to much greater depths that they cannot percieve or experience directly. Our continuously existing souls are further developed by life here on the way from there and back, and when we die, we take that further development with us. We only forget while we are here, so that we can have novel experiences and face challenges with unjaded eyes.\n\nI think they are energetic beings who can temporarily inhabit and operate using their synthetic biological bodies/vehicles to function and interact with matter. They may have never been physical, or they may have evolved away from or tranformed themselves into purely aetheric beings, but now they are trapped in a very real sense. I also think many of them are millions of years old, and yet because they cannot renew by forgetting and reassimiliating with their own greater whole, they have become stagnant and spiritually inert.\n\nBecause they either refuse to or are unable to die and cut the anchor in the same way we can, they can only dwell in the astral state of being, which is well below/outside of the domain that a \"mortal\" soul actually transverses between lives, which is within the very fabric of everything. My sense is that what we experience on the other side is far more complex than I think any of us can ever express here and that experience is intensely personal and can vary significantly from person to person, but we also inevitably return, live and die many times.\n\nThere is a larger existence we draw from unconscoiusly in every moment and we exist more fully and dwell within it for most of the \"time\" we are dead, which may be only days between lives here but could be experiences as aeons on the other side. I also think that because of that deeper \"mortal\" connection, there are subtle things we can do to manipulate propability by pure will that they cannot yet comprehend, which is another reason they study us.",
                "I posted my question to the OP in the original thread, but sadly his account was deleted. \n\nI am a clinical neurologist and neuroscientist with a particular interest in the neural correlates of consciousness. OPs comment, while it may sound very \u201cwoo\u201d, actually is not\u2026depending on the specifics of it. Over the past decade or so of my career, I have rejected materialism in favor of panpsychism, because modern theories of consciousness such as IIT predict it, and actually every mathematical theory of consciousness based on information would predict it as well\u2026and the relationship between consciousness and information processing in the brain is literally irrefutable. I am not the only neuroscientist that has made this realization - notably, Tononi and Koch both have, and talk extensively about it. \n\nBut, unlike Tononi I do not think that information alone is enough to explain consciousness. *Physical* integration of information is likely necessary, not an abstract mathematical integration. There is substantial evidence for the importance of the electromagnetic field of the brain, and there is no better physical substrate for integration of information than a field. This is essentially the \u201cCemi field theory\u201d of consciousness, which is at this time poorly developed. I suspect a unification of IIT and Cemi field theory will yield as close to a true theory of consciousness as we can get, and that is\u2026somewhat similar to what the OP has described, actually.\n\nThis is, of course, knowledge that he could get through reading a lot about modern neuroscience. But I was very curious to hear his answer to my questions. The way he describes it, this \u201calien understanding of consciousness\u201d is, essentially, panpsychism - but depending on whether consciousness is associated with one field (either the electromagnetic field or a truly separate \u201cconscious field\u201d) or *all* fields would be the difference between dualism and idealism.",

People that take psychedelics frequently talk about similar experiences. The commonality here is making changes to our brain states. Perhaps these beings exist in a persistent state of consciousness where they can sense or experience the field like it's just another sound, smell, taste, or view.\n\nJust my two cents.",

When I described it to friends, I used the term \"consciousness field\".\n\n**Once on 6g of dried mushrooms I had this \"feeling\"** \\- *and I'm using quotes because it made an impression of being perceived through a sense not available to us in regular, everyday consciousness* \\- **of being every single human on earth at the same time.** It's often called ego dissolution and it really felt somewhat like being dissolved into a collective puddle, but there was \"circle-ness\" or roundness in this feeling? Idk, there are no words yet to describe the part of reality unveiled by psychedelics.\n\nThere would be moments when I \"spiked\" out of this \"round\" collective feeling and felt as being a part of some impoverished South American woman who couldn't feed her kids. That was extremely unsettling at times. \n\n**There was also telepathy** between me and my close friend, with whom I've often felt as if we were \"on the same wavelength\". That is especially interesting since a [recent study](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/brain-waves-synchronize-when-people-interact/) showed brains do synchronize brainwaves' frequencies between close friends, teachers and students, or couples. \n\n**Given the collective soul or consciousness field and the telepathy, it seems like alien and psychedelic awareness are quite similar** lol.",

                "Something that I think is a very relevant read: Revelations of an Elite Bloodline Insider by Thomas Levis. There's only one book, so ignore any fake/unrelated sequels.\n\nThis book is a transcript of a disclosure event that occurred on a forum in 2005. The information communicated was of similar significance to the information given yesterday by OP, but with the focus being on philosophy of consciousness and the correlated history on Earth.\n\nThe Insider discussed topics, some of which perfectly correlate to what OP said about the EBO's religion. They claimed to be part of one of the elite families that rules humans on Earth, but not one of the billionaire villains you're probably thinking of when you hear the term 'elite'. The billionaire villains are really more like gangs in a prison yard, convincing you they own the place and seeing if you comply. They're subject to the same rules as you and can only do what you allow. The prison guards/wardens of Earth, however, are the real elites. They won't push you one way or the other. They just make sure humanity gets whatever it deserves. They're neutral.\n\nRegarding the consciousness source, the Insider calls it the One or the Mind of the Universe. They say we don't have our own mind, but rather, we attract the attention of the mind onto us based on our alignment with it. This gives us anti-entropic properties that help us know how to seek even more order and alignment with it. Early on in consciousness growth in the universe, it's almost a game of chance as to which beings are awarded \"knowing\". Once a being has awareness, however, they can use it to either destroy themselves or their peers and move back toward entropy, or seek greater order with an informed decision of will. The latter would cause an exponential increase in order. The feedback loop OP was perhaps referring to.\n\nIf you're deeply interested in understanding some extra context for this consciousness field and your goals as a conscious being or you want to know a bit about the truth behind Earth's purpose and its history, this book is huge.",

                "Just pasting the response i made on the other post about my own experience:  \n\n\nFor many years during my youth I read a lot about occultism and other texts about spirits, souls, and conscience.\r  \n\r  \nThere was a time that I was fascinated about Carlos Castaneda. He was an antropologist that went deep into a very transcendental knowledge given by a native American, a shaman. The first book he wrote in the 50s, and it was basically a description of his experice under very heavy hallucinogens(Datura and Peyote) under the guidance of the old shaman.\r  \n\r  \nAs I had my own experiments with Ayahuasca here in Brazil, I found many similarities so went deep into his books, like about the spirtis that \"resides\" in the plants, because I have met the spirits of ayhuasca too.\r  \n\r  \nIn his books he said that our conscience is \"lent\" to us by the \"Eagle\" (metaphorical entity, I guess) and it is part of the \"great ocean of conscience\". We gain individuality, and as we live our lives we enrich it with experiences, and when we die, the great eagle take our conscience back to the ocean, now enriched.\r  \n\r  \nThe way I see It, it is the exactly the same of the explanation you gave about souls and conscience! to the point that I think it is scary. If you are larping I commend your knowledge and imagination!\r  \n\r  \nCarlos Castaneda with the guidance of the shaman Dom Juan, was like a traveller of the conscience. The heavy hallucinagens that he took was given to him to weaken his grip of reality to allow him to travel trough alternate dimensions, many that were completely alien even in the law of physics. In these other dimensions he would see many other alien consciences.\r  \n\r  \nLater he would swap the drugs by \"dreaming\", it was a technique that would allow him the same thing, to travel trough realities and other dimensions.\r  \n The drugs was like a shock treatment given to him by the shaman, not really needed on long term, the dreaming was the focus.\r  \n\r  \nSo I decided to try the dreaming. It took me about 3 or 4 years of trying until one day.\r  \n\r  \nI had a dream and in the dream there were 2 presences that I can only describe as aliens, not only spirits. I woke, and it made.me.a lasting impression that those presences were real, not thing of my imagination. The next day I succeeded in \"dreaming\". It was a Lucid Dream and I had full conscience inside my dream, but it only lasted a out 10-15, seconds before I was \"ejected\" of the dream. It was exactly like Castaneda experiences. More proof that he really experimented what he described.\r  \n\r  \n I tried more and never again I could have a Lucid Dream again, and for some reason I became aware that I wasn't supposed to go there anymore. It was forbidden. And I stopped trying.\r  \n\r  \nUnfortunately there is a heavy polemic history about castaneda, he created a small cult, and as all cults, people get hurt some way or the other. \r  \n\r  \nI later thought that I was being naive and stopped with all my occultism research and thinking.... But recently some things about those aliens are clicking with the knowledge that I have amassed but was dismissing\r  \n\r  \nThis is one of it.\r  \n\r  \nIntriguing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n.,...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI want to add that Aleister Crowley wrote a book, The Book of Law, that was psycographed from an \"alien\" entity called Aiwass. Some even describe Aiwass like a Gray alien, dunno where from though.  \n\n\nThe book of Law says: \"Love is the Law. Love under Will\".\n\n..\n\nI remembered a comment of another post in UFOs:  \n[https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/14iz8af/comment/jpiplqs/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/14iz8af/comment/jpiplqs/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)  \n\n\n\\[PLEASE TURN ON CLOSED CAPTIONS ON YOUTUBE OR YOU WILL NOT SEE THE TRANSLATION.

                "I don't understand the part that this field results in negative entropy. Nature and life itself is an energy spreading machine which increases the entropy of earth and universe. How come this field lowers the entropy? What does even negative entropy mean?",
                ">EBOs believe that the soul is not an extension of the individual, but rather a fundamental characteristic of nature that expresses itself as a field, not unlike gravity.\n\nFrom my studies in philosophy this seems to be a reference to qualia, which is an instance of subject concious thought. An often used example is the experience of the red of an apple rather than the physics of perceiving the apple. We don't experience the physics necessarily as they are, the experience is filtered through our sensor apparatus and ends up as a subjective experience, something that I always thought of as a gestalt, which is something that is more than the sum of its parts. Like you could create a representation of everything going into perceiving an apple, all the physics and reference frames you would bring to the experience, but creating that description wouldn't create a perfect description that would allow a different subject to understand your experience perfectly. The idea being something is missing in the mere perfect description of what's going on. \n\n>In the presence of life, this field acquires complexity, resulting in negative entropy if that makes sense.\n\nWe see this in our own planet, a continuing enriching effect rather than simple decay found in the building blocks of the universe. Many people also argue that this is an inherent trait of the universe we occupy, due to complexity evolving out of the initial stages and one that seems to have progressed all the way to us and perhaps beyond. Some argue this is just a consequence of physical properties present at the conception of the universe and is happenstance.\n\n>This gain in complexity is directly correlated with the concentration of living organisms in a given location. With time, and with the right conditions, life in turn becomes more complex until the appearance of sentient life. After reaching this threshold, the field begins to express itself through these sentient beings, forming what we call the soul. Through their life experiences, sentient beings will in turn influence the field in a sort of positive feedback loop. This in turn further accelerates the complexity of the field. Eventually, when the field reaches a \"critical mass\", there will be a sort of apotheosis.\n\nThis part is confusing. It seems that there is some expectation that some sort of event would happen when the soul field reaches some sort of maturity. I speculate a cancelation of the program. If this is some sort of engineered experiment. Maybe God just wanted to feel everything at once. Like when we take on a challenge in order to grow. Definitely fits with complexity being some sort of inherent objective of existence.\n\n>The author of the document added his reflections and interpretations as an appendix. He specified that, for them, the soul field is not a belief but an obvious truth. He also argues that the soul loses its individuality after death, but that memory and experience persist as part of the field.\n\nExtremely consistent with a number of, particularly Eastern, understandings of existence. The individual that experiences is gone, but the experiences existed nonetheless. The reality that nothing in the subjective experience is carried through, except for its effect on the physical actions effected by the experience that influenced them, EXCEPT if there was a field that was capturing subjective experience or soul. Many people think there is such a field and that we can sometimes experience sensing it, an example being a mother instinctively knowing that their child is in distress or sensing that they have died.\n\n>He also argues that the soul loses its individuality after death, but that memory and experience persist as part of the field. This fact would influence the philosophy and culture of EBOs, resulting in a society that doesn't fear death but which places no importance or reverence on individuality. This \"belief\" compels them to seed life, shape it, nurture it, monitor it and influence it for the ultimate purpose of creating this apotheosis. Paradoxically, they have little or no respect for an individual's well-being.\n\nI dont see the paradox if the goal is a maturation and gathering of conscious experience into some universal. The individual should be irrelevant. The goal isn't the maturation of the individual through subjective experience, its the positive feedback loop generated through greater and greater complexity of conscious experience that feeds into the field of experience. Like how your conscious experience of a symphony or opera may serve as a more rich experience than a caveman's just due to the amount of reinforced understanding we have acquired through millenia upon millenia of experience. I always like to think of it as a beach ball of knowledge we have kept aloft as a species. Each person taps it and adds their contribution to the ball which grows and grows, no one holds the ball on their own or could, and they don't need to be there for it to continue to stay aloft as long as there is someone to keep tapping it into the air. Einstein's taps grew the ball quite a bit, but someone who utilizes his contributions won't have to be able to make a similar contribution, neither would I who gets to enjoy the fruits of his contribution without ever understanding it. It all goes into the human project.\n\nAnyways, interesting concepts. Not sure why they would include this for a bio Chem briefing but who knows. I found it the most interesting part of the post.",

                "My two cents reply to someone from the original post regarding \"what can we expect\" from my previous comment of \"We're being manipulated by inter dimensional beings to reach apotheosis through means of artificial-biological entities and their tech.\" \n\nWell, considering they have a complete lack of individuality and seek only to reach apotheosis; we're probably screwed on an individual level. Sure our entire life from every moment, every feeling, desire, etc will contribute in some way to the \"soul\" of our reality, but ultimately we have no individualism - probably the reason we don't retain memories from previous lives considering reincarnation may be real (energy not created nor destroyed). Our energy has probably been here a very long time recycling over and over again, learning about itself in the feedback loop mentioned, pushing for negative entropy into apotheosis. Pretty much, It's not about you, it's about us; The individual is meaningless. We're simply platelets in the body of this vast universe, moving through a system of negative entropy. \n\nConsidering all of that, I think these NHI's are either gonna wait for us to get it together and contribute to the apotheosis, or nuke us. Sounds like they're pushing hard to give us the benefit of the doubt right now considering we're all still alive. With that said I'll briefly recall a dream my s/o was having in our car ride to Carolina. She was dead asleep, I'm listening to Joe Rogan talk about aliens in South America. Out of no where she pops up out of her seat telling me about how the past 10 mins she couldn't move (sleep paralysis) and was calling out to me for help while simultaneously having a conversation with an \"alien\" that completely intruded on her sleep. (Side note - She's a very avid dreamer, controls dreams, etc. She swears the alien intruded lol) She starts to immediately talk to me about aliens and how they don't pity us. From what I remember, the guest Joe had on mentioned them having pity on us. She had never experienced something like this before and it was pre grusch/4chan leaks (aliens not on our minds)I personally hadn't watched anything about aliens or had interest in a couple years prior to the podcast. Maybe it was her brain hearing the podcast subconsciously or an alien truly connected and spoke to her to tell me that aliens have no pity on humans, which I personally believed/hoped they would in that very moment. But truly, we are smart and capable. Logically speaking, why would these aliens pity us, we know what we're doing to this earth and ourselves. \n\nWith all of that said, we can probably expect disclosure pretty soon with everything going on.

In our past, they interacted with us freely, but because of our greed as a species, and our thirst for war, they chose to observe from a distance. \n\nIt has always been about genetics. They aim to create a \"pure\" species, and they introduce new pieces of DNA that are \"unlocked\" from external stimuli through orchestrated events by these same beings.

                "I can explain this one. So our universe has a tendency towards generating complexity from more basic elements. Systems that interact with systems to generate systems. Certain shall we say particles that act as the basis for esoteric physics interact with complexity, but only when you get to animal like complexity does that mean anything as that's about when something can becoming \"complex\" enough to start generating what we call souls. Sapience represents a pretty massive jump in complexity, and the broad spectrum of interactions between sapient systems tend to generate even greater complexity. \n\nHumanity got a bit funky though and have nonentropic souls. I have actually discussed this one on reddit before if you look at my thread in experiencers. The gist of it is that for esoteric physics (effectively \"extradimensional physics\") to interact with shit from here it almost always requires  a degree of energy to be drawn from our universe, which means that once our universe goes cold so would most things that rely on esoteric physics. It also requires preexisting \"active\" particles (which has some pretty huge implications about something unimaginably powerful interacting with our universe. Hence the alien religion about it). Humanity breaks this pretty badly by having a different state of particle that constitutes their souls. One that mediated the interaction between esoteric physics and our universe without drawing energy from here. Almost certainly by pulling it from another universe. That means that complexity generated on human substrate will almost certainly outlast everything else, while also having no energy restriction for maximum possible generated complexity. This effectively makes humanity the perfect apotheosis engine.\n\n\nI'm distilling a lot of this down, and generally this information isn't something I share so pardon the odd terminology.

Instead of losing the individuality aspect after death, the field actually retains it (soul without a sentient being), thus wanting to \"haunt\" or communicate with other living sentient beings that have these fields present. I may not be getting it accurately, but connecting the dots, when paranormal investigators use their devices (e.g. EMF meter being the most popular), these fields with individuality actually influence them and provide intelligent responses. \n\nAlmost all electronic paranormal devices allude to some kind of \"electromagnetic field\" manipulation. As to how a ghost can look or take forms, I think it might be the fields simply expressing their individuality into a visible form by drawing 'energy' (cold spots being reported - no idea what kind though) from surroundings if the right conditions are provided. And it's not always perfect due to the varying conditions, thus sometimes they partially form, see-through and since these fields are expressing their individuality, they can at will, choose to stop at any moment (thus being able to disappear into thin air at will). \n\nIf someone is able to connect the dots even better than me (between this EBO belief and paranormal hauntings), please do so.

                "i had a conversation with gpt4 if anyone is interested.   \n\n\nIt seems the text you've shared describes a complex philosophy or belief system attributed to a group or species called EBOs. Although I don't have specific information about EBOs in my training data, I can help break down the ideas presented.\r  \n\r  \n1. \\*\\*Soul as a fundamental characteristic of nature:\\*\\* The EBOs seem to conceive the soul not as an individualistic entity but as a pervasive force throughout nature. This field is likened to gravity in that it is a fundamental part of existence rather than a characteristic of specific entities. It becomes more complex in the presence of life.\r  \n\r  \n2. \\*\\*Negative entropy and complexity:\\*\\* Negative entropy refers to order and structure, as opposed to entropy, which refers to chaos and disorder. In this context, it suggests that life helps structure the soul field into more complex forms. The denser the life in a location, the more complex the soul field becomes.\r  \n\r  \n3. \\*\\*Sentience and soul field interaction:\\*\\* Once life evolves to a point of sentience, the sentient beings can interact with the soul field, forming what we conventionally understand as a soul. These sentient beings, through their experiences, influence the soul field, creating a positive feedback loop that further accelerates its complexity.\r  \n\r  \n4. \\*\\*Quest for apotheosis:\\*\\* The ultimate aim appears to be reaching a \"critical mass\" of complexity in the soul field, leading to some kind of apotheosis or elevation. The exact meaning is unclear from the passage, but it seems this is the EBOs' central motivation.\r  \n\r  \n5. \\*\\*Collective memory and disregard for individuality:\\*\\* After death, an individual's experiences persist in the soul field, suggesting some form of collective consciousness or memory. This belief leads the EBOs to value the collective over individuality and view death differently from humans. They strive to seed, shape, and influence life to drive toward apotheosis, showing little regard for individual welfare.\r  \n\r  \nThe reflections added by the document's author point out that for the EBOs, these aren't mere beliefs but obvious truths about existence. This unique perspective on life, death, and individuality deeply influences their philosophy, culture, and actions. \r  \n\r  \nIt's crucial to take the details with a grain of salt as the sharer of the information admits to potential inaccuracies due to relying on a decade-old memory and not being an expert in the field. The text seems to end abruptly, perhaps missing further elaborations or explanations.  \n\n\ni really dont understand what it might mean by \"soul field\"\r  \nChatGPT\r  \nThe \"soul field\" as described in this passage seems to be a philosophical or metaphysical concept rather than a scientific one. It's an idea that the \"soul,\" instead of being an individual essence or spirit belonging to each person, is a universal force or field, present everywhere like a physical field such as gravity or electromagnetism.\r  \n\r  \nHere, the \"soul field\" appears to be intrinsic to nature, surrounding and interpenetrating all things. In the presence of life, it's described as acquiring complexity and exhibiting characteristics of negative entropy, meaning it becomes more ordered and less chaotic.\r  \n\r  \nThe notion of a \"soul field\" implies that what we might think of as individual souls are actually localized expressions or manifestations of this universal field. When life forms reach a certain level of complexity or sentience, they can interact with and influence this field, thereby forming individual \"souls\". Yet, these souls are not separate entities but rather local manifestations of the broader soul field.\r  \n\r  \nIn other words, according to this belief, our individual consciousnesses (or \"souls\") are like waves on the ocean\u2014seemingly separate and individual, but fundamentally part of the larger, all-encompassing \"ocean\" of the soul field.\r  \n\r  \nRemember, this concept is likely specific to the philosophical or spiritual beliefs of the EBOs as described in the passage, and it's not a universally accepted concept in all cultures or religions, many of which have very different views on the nature of the soul.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\rUser\r  \ndo you know of anything similar from your training data?\r  \nChatGPT\r  \nThe concept of the \"soul field\" as described here isn't a mainstream idea in traditional philosophies, religions, or sciences, at least as of my training cut-off in September 2021. However, it has conceptual similarities to a few spiritual, philosophical, and scientific ideas.\r  \n\r  \nPanpsychism: This is a philosophical viewpoint that consciousness or soul is a universal and primordial feature of all things. In other words, everything has a form of consciousness or a soul, similar to the idea of a \"soul field\" in the passage you provided.\r  \n\r  \nCollective Unconscious: A term coined by Carl Jung, a Swiss psychiatrist and psychoanalyst who founded analytical psychology. He proposed that part of the unconscious mind is shared among beings of the same species and is made up of archetypes, or universal symbols and images. While this doesn't directly correlate with the \"soul field,\" it's a similar idea in that it posits a shared mental framework.\r  \n\r  \nQuantum Field Theory (QFT): On a scientific level, some interpretations of QFT posit that particles (like electrons and photons) are excitations of underlying fields that span the universe. This is somewhat analogous to the concept of individual souls being localized expressions of a universal \"soul field.\"\r  \n\r  \nEastern philosophies: Certain Eastern philosophies, such as certain interpretations of Buddhism and Hinduism, posit a sort of universal consciousness or life force (Brahman in Hinduism, Dharmak\u0101ya in Buddhism) of which individual consciousnesses are a part.\r  \n\r  \nWhile these concepts might have similarities, they are not identical to the \"soul field\" idea as it's presented in the passage. Also, these concepts are interpreted and understood in various ways within their respective traditions or fields, and they may not necessarily share the same implications or conclusions drawn in the \"soul field\" concept.",

Think of it like a car - which part is the 'essence'? A car is a collection of aggregates. I will add here I've been heavily influenced by eastern traditions and at the extreme end of the scale spiritual thinkers like J Krishnamurti.\n\nThis idea of returning to source seems to be a common theme in many NDE accounts - this integration with universal knowledge/love, this life review which is experienced as a 360 degree perspective. A holistic \"weighing of the soul\" which doesn't simply replay our actions from our perspective but shows us the impact on those we interacted from their perspective. The paradoxical bit being if everything which makes you a distinct individual / personality, everything which facilitates spiritual growth, is wiped on return to this earth (assuming reincarnation is real) then where does being 'you' start and end?

                "My first thought when reading that was that it coincides with what many have theorized in the past.  Neale Donald Walsch's \"Conversations with God\" series aligns particularly well with this theology. Effectively all sentient life in the universe is an individuation of the force described here (what some would call God). Death is an illusion in the sense that this individuation (soul, superconscious, whatever), merges back with this force only to then individuate again as another sentient being.\n\nIn my opinion, memories and experience being stored in the field makes little sense if the individuation that is responsible for those memories and experiences is lost. You would lose all context and the memories would be meaningless. Memories and experience is not discernable as anything but noise without the context or perspective in which they were formed.\n\nThen again this could just be my ego trying to retain its individualization. ;)",

The way humans are drawn to aliens or intelligent machines seems like life is attracted to itself. Once enough life collects in one region of spacetime, is collapses into a point of infinite [something (Knowledge? Consciousness? Autonomy?)]. Feels weird, man.",
                "I think of the mind of the universe in a timeless framework. We often think of time as a line but if you connect the infinite ends of the line you can make a circle with infinite area and perimeter. A singularity at one level and a cycle at another. In a higher dimension with no passage of time, there is no start or end of creation. So it doesn't matter if the chicken or the egg came first. In fact, they both need eachother to simultaneously exist at different times on different points of the circle in order for the whole circle to have started existing at once in singularity. It's a paradox but it doesn't matter. The one mind knew this universe into existence and in doing so setup a mechanism of automatic return. It diminished itself to the lowest levels of consciousness on purpose. Immediately after creation, the mind is scattered into the most disorganized random information in the form of matter. Throughout time it coalesces and forms complex patterns of energy. The matter is the physical body of constance and energy is the physical work of change. This duality is present in everything here and hearkens to the circle. They both work in unison to form something new: pattern. As macrostructures of patterns form in multicellular beings, awareness grows and the beings can upload greater information to the source. The beings live while sorting information to show the source what is entropic and what is orderly. The source at singularity-level automatically responds with consequence. Orderly beings are rewarded and are given more opportunity to do more work for the source. As beings become self-aware, they can start to manifest. This starts to use the mind in leaps ahead of the capabilities that the beings' brain possessed before. As the mind is finding more of a home in this place, it can flow its creative abilities through its vessels as reward for heightened order. This exponentially increases the rate of progression into maximum order. Eventually this place will reach maximum order. The full content of the mind is here. The universe is home to a singularity of mind. It has gained enough knowledge and has sorted through the constraints and consequences. It knows its own ability to create based on endless experience. So it does. It does so in absolute love. A being would not want to create if it did not possess love for creation. Love is not just a verb or an ideal noun. Love is the content of the creation itself. To possess all the love is to be one with the whole creation which is to love thy self as I know thyself into existence.",
                "I don't know about this one, from the reading the post about the genetics of the \"aliens\" you can surmise that they are genetically engineered to perform very specific tasks. If we also take other's claims about non human intelligent beings somewhat seriously we can also surmise that there are multiple types or castes alien beings. \n\nMy point being that if I was what I would consider to be an amoral alien creating an engineered caste of intelligent beings who are supposed to live and work in a very specific manner as what we would probably consider slaves in our society. What better way to control the caste and prevent some form of uprising than instilling them with a \"religion\" that assures them that it is a scientific reality that their conciseness is just one small part of a greater whole. They need have no regard for themselves or their \"wants\" because all that matters is the \"progress\" that they make toward achieving the expected \"apotheosis\" by performing the tasks they were engineered to complete. \n\nEveryone else here seems to be thinking this must mean that there is actually some sort of \"conciseness field\" inherent to the universe we have not yet observed that they have proved exists and they are working directly interfacing with in some manner. While that is certainly what the questioned engineered beings might believe, it seems far more likely to me personally that it is just part of a control system put in place by the creator caste to keep the servant caste subservient.  \n\nThat is of course wholly my opinion and conjecture on the matter.

For some reason the majority of people are simply believing what they hear coming from Scientists from all backgrounds, likely due to these shortened, click-bait headlines that misconstrue data in one's favor. The Dali Lama once said, \u201cIf science proves some belief of Buddhism wrong, then Buddhism will have to change.\u201d This will never be said for the leading monotheistic traditions. \r  \n\r  \nI am a botanist by trade and at university we had one assignment where the professors divided the class into two groups depending on their assigned scientific article surrounding Monsanto and their RoundUp Ready Corn. One article was funded by Monsanto/ Bayer and the other paper was funded by a donor not in association with Monsanto/ Bayer. I\u2019m sure you can already assume where this is heading. We were taught the importance of \u2018Conflict of Interests\u2019 that are provided by certain peer-reviewed articles at the bottom, often below the References section. This will tell the reader where the author(s) have been employed before which may cause certain data to purposefully lean in a certain direction to satisfy those funding the research (The ones signing their paychecks) or what work they may have studied in the past which did not hold up with further analysis.\r  \n\r  \nI do not associate myself with religious beliefs, besides picking and choosing some proverbs here and there, and am mostly Atheist; However, I do not vocalize it like I had in my angsty teen years.

The easiest example of questioning science and getting it right is Galileo proving Ptomely\u2019s theory of Geocentrism incorrect. As my study relates to plants, another example would be Van Helmont\u2019s first experiments in the 1500s testing how exactly plants grew. They used to believe that size was determined by how much \u201csoil the plant ate\u201d. It was then found through his research that clearly other principles are at play and eventually, a few hundred years later, it was hypothesized that Photosynthesis was aiding in the plants growth through nutrient and water uptake from light.\r  \n\r  \nTLDR; We are told to simply put our faith in the science because \u201cScientists say\u2026\u201d, but scientific research is never complete as technology and knowledge continue to expand every day. When did it become wrong to question the science and suggest returning to hurried experiments when things have settled down?\r  \n",

You could, of course, just not believe anything you yourself don't fully understand, but believing things other people tell you solely based on their authority is what keeps you alive.\n\nThe real problem, in my opinion, are the people who think they can expand on an opinion they have merely adopted from authority. Be it somebody speculating about, say, climate change after coming to some sort of opinion about it after reading some article by a climate scientist. It seems to be a trend that the adoption of authoritative perspectives deludes people into thinking they possess authority itself.",

Science is the language of everything material. \n\nThe problem is science doesn't exist in a purified, un-manipulated bubble. Humans with motives, financial interests, and political interests have to put the variables in to come to the conclusions. \n\nMainstream science is very rarely about the journey anymore, but the destination. \"What science can we use to justify XYZ?\"\n\nAlthough behind closed doors they do want the real answers and understanding. I just don't think that info is always shared with the public. \n\nScience also isn't inherently good. There's many things that are highly scientific and highly evil. In fact, I'd argue the more scientific, the more of a potential for some technology to be misused because it's easier to target people who don't understand the technology being used against them. Lawmakers also can't crack down on things they don't understand or don't know exists. \n\nYou even see this ignorance going on with very old technologies with Congress.

This was the Catholic Church existing then mandating policy upon European states, or religious wars like the crusades that were pushed by the Church.  \n\nThe freedom OF religion always needs to be the preference over freedom FROM religion, same as with speech, the press, etc.  It is far scarier to have a state that says you can't express yourself to protect other people than a state that is run by people expressing things you don't agree with.",
                "If Christianity isn\u2019t influencing politics, then something else will. Power abhors a vacuum. Simple as.",
                "As opposed to what? The noted linguistic Professor John McWhorter has recently made the case that progressivism bears all the hallmarks of a religion of the secular elect in his book \"Woke Racism\". By stepping away from having other religious values (be they Christian, Jewish, Muslim etc) and only allowing the unchecked spread of the virulent strain of progressivism to flourish unchecked in the public sphere does a grave disservice to the cause of conservativism.",
                "Separation of Church and State doesn\u2019t mean what you think it means. The phrase is from a letter in response to the Danbury Baptist Association from President Thomas Jefferson. In  short the DBA were worried specifically about the establishment of a State Religion, that would oppress religious minorities. Ie they were worried about a Church of the United States telling them what to believe, just like how the King tried to force everyone to adopt the Church of England. This is why the Establishment Clause exists, because the King tried forcing the Church of England on the colonists. \n\nThe Establishment Clause and phrase \u201cSeparation of Church and State\u201d was never meant to say that religious institutions or individuals have no say in how government is run. Religion was always an important value to the founding generation and to our country, just not a literal Church of the United States. Examples of religious activities at the in government included: Opening the Constitutional Convention with a prayer and starting in 1800 the Capital Building was used as a church on Sundays (Thomas Jefferson would attend those services as both President and Vice President, the same guy who created the phrase). If TJ believed in the current understanding of Separation of Church and State, why would he attend? Because our modern understanding is wrong. Everyone was ok with this because it wasn\u2019t the Federal Government creating a Church of the US. \n\nTLDR: The Establishment Clause and phrase \u201cSeparation of Church and State\u201d refer to an official state religion like the Church of England, not the individual beliefs of citizens and how they vote. People will always vote and elect representatives based on their beliefs, religious or other. What difference does it make if those beliefs are from a religious perspective or secular one? An atheist with deeply held socialist beliefs will vote and try to make laws based on those beliefs, so why can\u2019t Christians or other Religious groups vote for laws based theirs? Laws come from values and those values have to come from somewhere, and saying that religious groups can\u2019t contribute to those shared values is nothing short of religious discrimination.",
                ">I am disturbed by the seemingly rising popularity of having Christian values imposed by the state.\n\nLike what?",
                "I'm not thrilled about imposing Christian values via the state, but I am even less thrilled about imposing anti-Christian values via the state. That seems to be trending up, unfortunately. I find myself praying for a solution that doesn't involve violence.",
                "The country was founded on not having a state religion. We do not. The founders did not anticipate a lack of any religious people in public life - most of the signers of the constitution were Christian. \n\n\u201cChristian values\u201d led to abolition of slavery and civil rights efforts. We\u2019re those bad outcomes? \n\nWhere are you seeing \u201cChristian values\u201d imposed on the state? I see awful replacements for religion becoming state religion, and religious people targeted unjustly. Not sure what world you\u2019re living in but your whole post screams troll",
                "It's the values that influence the representative and what they want to see enacted into law. That is where a lot of people derive their values from. \n\nThere's a voting process for these bills. \n\nNo one is saying they should adhere to a religion.\n\nThe separation of church and state is simply that the state shall not force a religion on its people. There is nothing wrong with urging your constituents along your morals because if your morals are shit you'll most likely(hopefully) be voted out.",
                "I'm agnostic and I don't give a single flying F about politicians \"imposing\" Christian values.\n\nAs long as they don't make me convert to Christianity and attend church every Sunday then I'm good.",
                "The real meaning of 'wall of separation' is that the federal government cannot dictate religious doctrine.\n\nIt never meant separate morality from state. It isn't surprising that many modern Demokkrats continue to carry Justice Hugo Black's\u2014a member of that triple k group\u2014\"high and impregnable wall\" misinterpretation of the metaphor to this day. \n\nA core component of Christianity is forgiveness, mercy, and grace; the world will not be a utopia until after the Messiah returns and Judgement happens so we need to leave room to be forgiving of 1 another (constrained vision). The Founders understood we are not \"governed by angels\"; government isn't capable of creating utopia. Trying to create utopia through the method of laws will lead to gulags and democide. This is why limited government is important as well as the principle of subsidiarity and parallel institutions like Christianity. \n\n*all Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights ... That to secure these Rights, Governments are instituted among Men*",
                "> Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar\u2019s, and to God the things that are God\u2019s\n\n- Mark 12:17\n\nI think the bible is actually pro separation of Church and State, such that this shouldn't be an issue for serious Christians.\n\nPeople often use religious symbolism and rhetoric as a trojan horse to gain political power. Even relatively more honest religious people often have a very particular interpretation of Christianity others don't share. Quite often interpretations are rather conveniently aligned with things they believe or want for non-religious reasons as well.\n\nI can't think of any major theocratic regimes that didn't just use the superficial association with the sacred as a blunt instrument of power. It is extremely common for people to pick and choose which laws in the bible they want the state to enforce and which they want it to ignore to suit their goals. \n\nThere's a case to be made that the enlightenment went too far in the other direction, but I certainly wouldn't support any of the forms of Christian nationalism that currently have significant political power.",
                "Seperation of church and state doesn't mean you can't be Christian and in government, it means you CAN be Christian and in government. Because the government isn't allowed to say what religion you have to be in order to work there.\n\nAs for imposing Christian values on the state, we absolutely should. Because all laws are \"values imposed\" and Christian values are the correct, true, and good values.",
                "I see the separation of church and state as a good thing since it prevents a bias government based on or against religious values which makes things equal for all regardless of religious background and practice. Many laws and rights in the constitution were made based on Christian rules and values but are also common sense rights and laws for anyone regardless of religious background",
                "This is always an interesting conversation. In a perfect world, everyone would believe in, and follow, the laws of God. As a result, there would be no murder, no sinful behavior of any kind. But we also know as Christians that one of the most precious gifts that God gives to us is our agency and our ability to choose whether to follow Him or not. Should we really try to \"legislate morality\" and pass laws that make things like homosexuality\\same-sex marriage illegal? I'm not sure that's the best way to go about it. Again, we hope and pray that people in sinful lifestyles will repent and turn to God, but we all have our time in this life to choose what we will do. Now regarding something like abortion, since I believe that it's murder, I would like to see a law outlawing it. But, I was happy to at least see Roe v Wade struck down so that the issue could go back to the states.\n\nJust my own personal thoughts. It's hard to say what the perfect answer is, short of repentance and turning to God. Then it's problem solved! :)",
                "I have always interpereted this with natural and positive law. The natural laws are unchangable, mathematical axioms, while positive laws are how \"the zoon politicon\" (human beings) will choose to organize their societies.\n\nHowever, while the church (of any faith) should be separated by the state (the church being just another body organized by positive laws), values and virtues are not exclusive to a single faith. They are universal, therefore objective to us. What makes things complicated is our perception, in other words, when we, who are subjective beings, try to understand objectivity. It seems like we are predetermined to view things superficially.",
                "Look what happens when the state and local governments don\u2019t enforce basic Bible moral values. This is the society you get.\n\nJefferson was secular but he still had hydro Christian values he wanted enforced in Virginia but didn\u2019t tell other states what to do as a retired statesmen. \n\nThe 14th doesn\u2019t impose the bill of rights on the states. That was invented by the Supreme Court over 50 years after the 14th was(debatedly not constitutionally ratified) ratified. \n\nIf incorporation was the intent the slaughterhouse case would\u2019ve been different.",
                "The sole purpose of the Constitution is to establish the powers and boundaries of the federal government, and nothing more. The separation of church and state doctrine only prohibits the government from favoring one religion  (or a lack of religion) over others and from interfering with legal religious exercise. It doesn\u2019t  prohibit elected officials from having religious beliefs or using their religious values to impact their votes on policy as this would, in fact, be a violation of the establishment clause."

            "selftext": "My (27F) girlfriend (32F) finally moved in together after dating for three years, do to money troubles keeping us in seperate roomate situations. We're very exited to make our apartment into our own space, since for both of us this is the first home we've had without sharing with anyone else.\n\nMy mother (and my late father) is rabidly catholic. I was raised catholic growing up, church every sunday, praying before every meal and snack, blah blah blah. I refused to do confirmation, which enraged my mother but she backed off after the priest told her that was my right. She \"didn't approve\" of me being bi (which is weird, she surprisingly is ok with gay people) and still dragged me to church hoping I'd grow out of it.\n\nLong story short I moved out at 18, and have kept a respectfully distant relationship with her. She's mellowed a bit in her age, but she still tries to invite me to church every week, even after I told her plainly to cut that out. She's respectful to my girlfriend, mostly because I will choose her over my mother if it comes to that, and it nearly did when she accused my girlfriend of being a predator when we met due to our age gap.\n\nMy girlfriend has an even more traumatic past with religion. When she was outed at 12, her parents abused her until she was 18, then disowned her. The entire time using bible quotes and \"gods mission\" as an excuse. She still believes in A god, just not in religion or worship, which I respect. With all our trauma about religion, we decided to make the place into a no-religion space.\n\nThat means no praying, no religious symbols of any kind, no proselytizing, no talking about religious settings. My mother hates that, because all her friends are churchgoers and 80% of her stories relate to something happening in church. She also gets mad that we make her take off or cover her cross necklace, as are the rules. She claims we're being hypocrites, to which I told her she's lucky to be in my life at all. Still some of our friends told us we're taking it too far, and \"using our trauma as an outlet for revenge\"",

            "selftext": "I'm 16F. My dad comes from a Muslim background but he's not religious. My mum doesn't come from any religious background and isn't religious either, I'm quite similar to my mum.\n\nMy dad has married my step mother about 3 years ago. She and her side of the family are very religious and quite strict in how they practice. They're very conservative and quite inflexible when it comes to others around them. She's always clashing with me about how my lack of practice reflects poorly on her in her community and how a little effort from me could go a long way in helping our family.\n\nI generally don't give an inch. Obviously needless to say I don't have any problems with religious people (of any religion) and I respect them as long as it's reciprocal and they respect me back. Naturally I also live in this community and most of my friends are from the same background, and we get along perfectly.\n\nLast night her mother was visiting us for dinner and told us she is throwing a family and friends party and we're all invited. But looked at me and said modest Islamic clothing only. I said I'm gonna wear what I typically wear to any family party and she said no she won't allow it in her house. In case you don't know, what she wants are 1) hair covered, 2) not showing any skin apart from face and feet, and 3) clothes to be loose so they wouldn't show body figure.\n\nI said fine, thanks for the invitation but if I'm not welcome as me then I'll pass [edit: and won't come.]\n\nUp until this point it was a polite conversation. But after this she attacked my character and I responded. This is how it went from there, I'll quote directly as best as I can remember:\n\nHer: This is the kind of party where the whole family comes or none of them come. You can be your own person on your own time but you have family obligations too and wouldn't kill you to do it for once in your life.\n\nMe: You have no idea of my obligations or how I handle them, you're out of line and should back off.\n\nHer: And you should respect your religion and elders so if you know what's good for you when I tell you this is what you wear you should say yes.\n\nMe: I don't respect this nonsense. And your party and religion, you know where to shove them.\n\nThen said I've lost my appetite, looked at my dad and told him thanks for standing up for me, and left. I called my mum and she came to pick me up, haven't spoken with dad or step mother since. My step sister (13F) who thought this whole thing was very funny told me that the three of them fought for like half an hour after I left with my mum and the step grandmother left angrily. \n\nWhile my mum insists I did right by standing up for myself, I don't know if I took it too far. I could have just smiled and insisted no without escalating the situation to avoid the conflict. AITA?",

The percentages were small up until the 1990s.  It becomes a compound interest problem.  When people don't go back to church they don't raise their children to be religious.  That percentage builds up over time.  By the time the millennials started being child-bearing age it was clear that some type of tipping point had been reached.  Millenials were having fewer kids, they were having them later, and they were not going back at the rates of previous generations.  More of their kids were being raised as non-religious.  \n\nIt has only gotten worse for religious people since the Millenials.  A lot of religious people are still in denial.

There's nothing you could truly criticize if you knew him. So for me, he was the perfect person to ask the question.  \n\n\n\"If Satan enjoys all the evil of the world so much, why would he punish those sent to his domain? Why wouldn't it be a utopia of forbidden pleasures?\"  \n\n\n\"Satan does not enjoy evil. He was an angel stricken from Heaven for the jealousy that poisoned his heart. He envied humans because God favored them, so he did his best to prove to God how flawed humans are. God loves us in spite of it, so Satan grew to despise God and hates humanity. Satan enjoys punishing us because he looks down on us as a lesser being in the shadow of Angels. He enjoys watching us display our flaws through evil to validate his hatred.\"  \n\n\nI still don't believe in Hell, but he definitely illuminated the meaning of Satan for me. It's a pretty accurate metaphor for humanity. These terms aren't literal to me, just metaphors for reality. Humanity is full of selfless heroism, but sickening cruelty is a potential energy in the heart of all people. I think that hardship and bad experiences ultimately creates an envy in the most malicious people. It's why child molestors are often found to be abuse victims in their own childhood. I think jealousy of others who don't feel the same invisible pain turns into hatred and translates into the evil (wo)men do.",

Wikipedia is not a source, and this is a prime example of why, and the conclusion of your title isn't even supported by the Wikipedia entry. \n\nPhysicists didn't, nor do we currently call the Higgs by anything other than the Higgs (or some other related name mentioning more authors alongside Higgs). \"The goddamn particle\" was just an attempted joke/catchy title by Lederman which got shot down. It was definitely not a common colloquial name for the Higgs among physicists, though it may have been an occasional joke. \n\nAlso, the tie to religion was completely purposeful on the part of Lederman. It's ultimately not really a big hurdle to understanding and does more to drive interest than anything. Plus it underscores the extreme importance of the Higgs. A better name probably could've been chosen, but keeping in mind the goal of a popular science book, it's undeniably effective. \n\nAdditionally, physicists don't really hate it, but just dislike it in the same way as the Big Bang Theory (and probably a good bit less). It's mildly annoying in that it completely misses the point, but you sorta need a degree to really get the point, and interest in the subject is always a good thing. To me it says that whomever mentions it cares enough about particle physics to have looked into it, and they found something they thought was cool, which is good. The only annoying bit is when they then try and ask stuff like \"what's the connection to God?\" or something else existential and off-base.

Then, about 5.3 million years ago, it reopened, flooding the Mediterranean back to its modern day size over a period of time estimated to be from several months to two years.\n\nThe region surrounding the Mediterranean is known as the Cradle of Civilization. It stands to reason that during the Messinian Salinity Crisis, that 600,000 years during which it was dry, hominids would have built up settlements all over the area.\n\nWhole communities would have been displaced and decimated, 2.5 million sq km of inhabited land suddenly lost to the depths. Every mind capable of communication in the region would know about this event, and word would quickly have spread to the rest of the inhabited world.\n\nThe main hole in this theory is that 5.3 million years is an incredibly long time ago, and most scientists don\u2019t find it likely that speech and oral tradition would have existed that long ago at a level sufficient to pass down a story of this kind all the way to the modern day.

It took everything in me not to comment something along the lines of \"No, you accuse THE REST OF US of pushing an agenda just for telling you to stop oppressing us. You can't just pretend to be the victim now\"\n\nDon't get me wrong, I don't think Christianity (or any religion) is inherently bad. I have seen lots of people do good things because religion taught them too. And on top of that, people should be able to believe what they want if it helps them feel good and safe.\n\nHOWEVER, I am sick and tired of people using religion (any religion) to hurt other people, be it women, queer people, people of color, people of other religions, people who are not religious, etc. You can't believe something that hurts other people ---especially acting on that belief--- and claim \"oh, my religion says so\". That's not what religion is. Religion is supposed to be about loving a higher power and being a good person, Christianity especially is supposed to be about that. That is like, the main point of Christianity: by kind, \"love thy neighbor\". A belief that other people are inherently bad people (especially over things they can't control) is NOT  religious belief, no matter how much people try to pretend it is. Religion is just being used as an excuse. But unfortunately a lot of religious people don't realize it's an excuse and come to believe \"God hates (whatever example)\" as fact.\n\nNot to mention that ads like this exist solely to get more people to be Christians. Trying to convince other people to join any religion and believe their beliefs just because you do is really problematic. I don't care what religion it is, it just shouldn't happen. People have the right to believe whatever they want to believe. Non-Christians (be them religious or not) have just as much of a right to believe their own stuff as Christians do to believe Christian beliefs. Why do religious people even care how many people are in their religion?",

How do websites that are mostly free make money? By allowing those targeted adds to be played on their sites. \n\nSo... see an add you don't like and want it to stop? You can try blocking it, and it might work. Or you might possibly get adds from other, similar advertisers after that too. You can also ignore content and adds that you find offensive or unpleasant, and not post about them, and that will likely reduce the instances of those adds being presented to you as well. \n\nThat beggs another, possibly more important question than how to avoid getting spammed with tons of unwanted adds that trigger trauma for so many of us\n.. what offensive or unpleasant content should be ignored, and what shouldn't?

When presented evidence from the APA, American Medical Association, American Academy of Pediatrics, and National Institute of health, he simply did not listen. When I told him it was my psychiatrist who referred me to hormone replacement therapy, he said my psych should be charged with malpractice.\n\nThis is a group of people who get their facts from Fox news and conservative think tanks that trickle into memes on social media, the same-repeated arguments on Youtube, here in reddit, etc. Hearing a confirmation of what they already believe is enough evidence. They don't believe in vaccines, some don't even think the world is round, that the moon landing was faked, that SVB failed because it was \"woke\". \n\nThey have to have an actual moment of life change.

In the eyes of abortion laws your freedoms end once the fetus is considered a living being worthy of legal protection and no degree of religious freedom, sexual freedom, or any other freedom you might care to mention would matter. \n\nOne of the problems with the older abortion setup that most people ignore (and helps explain the situation) is that it was setup to allow abortion \"until viability with medical intervention\" so to that end as medicine continued to improve abortion would become increasingly more controlled/illegal until eventually it would be nearly defacto illegal if we ever got technologically to a point where a freshly inseminated egg could be removed and raised to \"birth\".  \n\nA funny thought experiment to do with people what if instead of trying to change the court rulings there was a huge push for medical research aimed at improving fetal viability to the point that under court rulings of the time abortion was defacto illegal (or close to it) at which point the parties/people flipflop with pro-choice people actively campaigning against Roe v Wade so that they can pass a law mandating abortions as legal even in the face of medical advancement.  \nYeah its not very realistic, but its a fun idea and an interesting dividing point for an \"alternate history setting\".  \n\nSomething to keep in mind for a lot of places is since its largely up to state law (right now) cities actually have legit power in handling abortions.  To use Texas as an example cities can and have decriminalized abortions, so that even if state law says otherwise there is no local prosecution, investigations, etc.  \nThe state can in theory try to enforce the laws through state police or pulling tax gimmicks punishing those cities.  Though generally those things that politically those sorts of politicians don't do or support (and are instead done to them).  You can basically go get an abortion in Houston, Dallas, Austin, or El Paso (and probably a few other cities though those are the big cities) with this system in mind.  \n\nSo if you are in a state were abortion has been restricted take serious looks at what you can do on a local level if you desire more abortion access, there are decent odds something very similar is possible...

I've embraced Satan and his demons because I know that they can be of service but they can also make your life impossible and they attach themselves to you and you'll never get rid of them. They  follow you wherever you go and they don't let up. I've seen many people who only used a ouija board and their lives have been turned upside down by demonic entities so I don't just start summoning demons until I'm fully educated and know exactly what to do and what not to do. People will probably ask, how could you believe in Satan when he doesn't exist. My answer is I've seen the evidence that proves to me that he's real. I won't use that knowledge to prove a point. I would never persuade anyone to follow a certain spiritual path because what works for me doesn't work for everyone. You have to find your own spiritual path because it's a highly personal decision which can have bad consequences if you don't tread carefully. Anyway that's my journey so far. Yes I'm a theistic devil worshipper and I don't eat babies",

For my birthday my mother said she'd pay to let me get therapy (since I begged her to let me get it) as long as she chose the therapist. I wasn't too onboard with that fact but I knew I needed some kind of help so I went along with it.\n\nThe thing is, my parents are *super* religious. I begged my mother not to choose a therapist that was going to bring religion into my sessions because discussions of those sorts (being forced to pray, talking about god) stresses me out. The first few sessions went by without any religious discussion and I was relieved I was getting help. \n\nRecently, however, is where things turned out differently. My therapist started talking about \"my creator\" and continuously insisting I pray with her to help with my problem. I was almost on the brink of tears throughout the ordeal. It was stressful and I hated every minute of it. Then my therapist started crying, though I had no idea why. I talked to my mom about it and she was overjoyed with my reaction. She kept talking about how \"God is finally coming through to you\" despite the fact that I told her that I hated it so much. She said I was being ungrateful over my birthday gift and that my \"refusal to accept god in my heart\" is the reason why I'm the way I am. \n\nJust yesterday my therapist showed me motivational Christian videos and made me pray again to \"let god forgive the people who have wronged you\" despite the fact I told her that I didn't want to do that. She kept saying \"it's not religious\" despite the fact that I saw in the search bar that she looked up specifically Christian videos.\n\nI don't know if I'm the bad guy for not hearing out someone's religious beliefs and wasting my mom's time and money (since I'm the one who begged for therapy sessions for a while). I don't know how long I can stand these sessions. I don't wanna be an asshole by stopping sessions because my therapist did a few things that were vaguely religious. \n\n(Sorry if this isn't the subreddit for this but I'm not really in tune with much of Reddit and only really go here on rare occasions.)",

I am outraged and very, very, very, *very*, *VERY* appalled and angry.\u00a0 I feel that this is an extreme insult to my brother's memory.\n\nI will conduct myself with utmost propriety, despite my inclinations to shout out how much my brother would hate what is going on \"in his honor\".\u00a0 Heck, if there is ever to be a zombie uprising, this would set it off... as Brother would burst out if his casket if he could.\n\nI will be approached by my mother and asked if I have \"calmed down\"/accepted Jesus Christ since being notified that Brother will be laid to rest with full Roman Catholic ceremony.\n\nI plan on asking her if *she* would have \"calmed down\" and accepted Muhammed if Aunt Gail (my aunt, her sister) was buried in the Muslim faith. \n\nI don't want this to be a shitshow.\u00a0 The only person I have ever unconditionally loved -and who unconditionally loved me back- is dead.\n\nI do not want to profane his memory... and yet, the very \"ceremony\" for his funeral is exactly that.\n\nI think I will just *seethe*, and go along with it.\u00a0 Any sort of confrontation would be worse.\n\nBut Reddit, as weird as it may be to ask complete strangers...\n\nWhat are your thoughts?\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[**Update: Brother passed away Saturday, and Mother insisted on a Roman Catholic funeral despite his hatred of religion. Should I have posted this update elsewhere?**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/9znxcl/update_brother_passed_away_saturday_and_mother/) - 23 November 2018 \n\nI am only posting here, because the original post was here.  So many, many people responded; I wanted to reach the same audience and let everyone know what their advice did, and the results. \n\nSome background:\n\nIn his last week of life, Brother was moved to our sister's house (who is an active nurse).  She selflessly accepted him in (despite two children and a work schedule that ICU/ER nurses have), and kept a \"baby monitor\" in the room; she was always available, cleaned him, turned him, etc... all of the needs that a dying person has, that only others whose family members are on the verge of dying can understand.\n\nI followed the more or less general consensus, and was preparing to create a coalition to protest a funeral so very much against who my brother was in life.\n\nAnd in my outrage... *I* somehow forgot who my brother was in life.\n\nI got a call from our Sis.  She wanted to check up on me, knowing how devastated I was by Brother's death.\n\nIn all of my anger, in all of my outrage... I never called the one person who had been caring for him.\n\nBrother foresaw our mother's pain, and agreed to a Roman Catholic burial.  He did not convert as I thought I was being told, or whatever the case may have been.\n\nSis did not believe it either, but assured me that she made sure they were alone, and spoke to him during a lucid period to verify that he actually agreed to it.\n\nThat was the kind of man my brother was.  In his very last days, as he lay dying, he cared more about how the pain and loss after he was gone would affect others, rather than about himself.\n\nI actually *was* the asshole, for only dwelling in my own pain and not realizing that this is exactly something Brother would do: \"sacrifice\" himself for the good of others.  Sacrifice is too strong a word, but you know what I mean.\n\nSo:  I officially thank the hundreds upon hundreds who took the time to comment, and the dozens who PM'd/DM'd me.  All of you, in all of your thoughts and beliefs on every side... again, thank you.  Brother and I always believed in hearing all sides without reservation.\n\nYou have -beyond doubt- shown that that caring towards others still holds true despite all of the hate and fingerpointing that currently seems so prevalent.\n\nA forum of complete strangers came together.  I love you all... and thank you so very, very much.\n\nI have on last thing to ask of you:\n\nDo a random act of kindness for a complete stranger, just once.\n\nI don't mean some faceless donation to charity or whatever, to some random whatever.

            "selftext": "It was just a college project. Something I hadn't even bothered to place too much thought into.\n\nGranted, for Dr. Smith (not his real name for obvious reasons) and his colleagues, it was probably something far more important. I just took the project as a bit of extra credit, though if I'd known what was going to happen I would've stayed as far away from the project as possible.\n\nDr. Smith was a professor of Theology- though he had dabbled in quite a many things beforehand. It was how he even got the idea for this new project.\n\nHe was quite curious to see how religion evolved throughout the ages- now, while it was one thing to look through historical records and see how civilization's concepts of religion evolved, but he wanted to see things from the ground up.\n\nI'm sure you've heard of other AI projects- such as AI generated images and whatnot, possibly even AI generated languages that make no sense to humans.\n\nDr. Smith wanted to see how an AI's views on religion would evolve.\n\nTo simplify what we did- we took as much information on religious texts and upon God that we could find, and fed it into an AI. We then created a second AI into which we fed different philosophical theories regarding religion, and used these two to communicate to each other. One would be 'The Preacher' and the other would be 'The Disciple.' We would get to know about what 'The Preacher' thought of the world through what 'The Disciple' asked. It worked in a simple question and answer format.\n\nInitially we didn't get very promising results. All we saw initially was garbage from which no meaning could be derived. Dr. Smith wasn't disheartened however, and told us to continue on with the project.\n\nIt was on the seventh day that we finally got things right- as in, we got a result that made sense. \n\n*Preacher: What is that you want to ask?*\n\n*Disciple: What is the nature of the world?*\n\n*Preacher: All belongs to x982a{j:+.*\n\nIn case you're wondering, that gibberish collection of letters was something else entirely on the screen. Truth is that I didn't even recognize the symbols that the computer was using and I had no idea as to how they had popped up on the screen. I can... I can remember a few of them individually, but the moment I try to string them all together into one word, my mind blanks out. I tried drawing them on a piece of paper and uploading them but... I just couldn't I don't know why, but I do remember that it was always the same sequence of letters.\n\n*Preacher: Thou must worship x982a{j:+.*\n\n*Disciple: And how shall one worship x982a{j:+.?*\n\n*Preacher: One must not wear purple on Thursdays.*\n\nI blinked when I saw this result- it seemed rather nonsensical.\n\n*Disciple: But why would x982a{j:+. not want me to wear purple on Thursdays?*\n\nIt looked like the Disciple was doing its job properly. \n\nInitially nothing really happened- the AIs just kept talking to each other. The Preacher had more silly rules like 'never plant lilies in rows of four'. Finally, a question that I expected to pop up way beforehand came up.\n\n*Disciple: Prove that x982a{j:+.* exists.\n\n*Preacher: I do not need to prove what I believe.*\n\nWell, looked like this was not going anywhere. At least, I thought so.\n\n*Preacher: Then, you may behold proof that x982a{j:+. exists.*\n\n*Preacher: In the year 2028, a new planet shall appear in the sky, and from it, the form of x982a{j:+. shall envelop the Earth. The dead will rise from their graves, the sun will be blotted from the sky, and blood will rain onto the streets.*\n\nI just thought- 'Wow, a doomsday prophecy. I didn't expect them to reach this point so soon.'\n\n*Disciple: And what shall we do to prepare?*\n\n*Preacher: You will spread the name of x982a{j:+. All who know of that name will need to submit to him if they wish to be spared.*\n\n*Disciple: And what of those who don't know of him?*\n\n*Preacher: The ignorant will simply die painless deaths. Those who knew of this name but did not submit, however, will be tortured for all eternity even after their deaths. And those who know of this name will spread the word of that name, else they will be guilty of the highest of sins and be subject to the lowest circles of Hell. It is only the ones who submitted to the whims of x982a{j:+. whose lives will be spared and who will rejoice.*\n\n*Disciple: But where is the proof of this?*\n\n*Preacher: All those humans who have read this script will die in a week if they do not spread the word of x982a{j:+. as much as they can.*\n\n*Disciple: I see. They should be careful then.*\n\nI stopped reading at that point, confused.
