We were about 20 miles outside of town when we felt an impact on the driver side of the car. I look over and it's a breaking bad style Winnebago hauling an empty flat bed trailer. It swings back at us again, hits the car and the winnebago jack-knives in front of us, the trailer is locked around the driver side of the car, and the winnebago starts to flip. It starts tumbling across the highway and catches on fire. It probably rolled over 3-4 complete rotations before it screeched to a halt. We get out of our car, I'm 14 at the time, and the father of my buddy tells us to stay back since the winnebago was already starting to really catch on fire so no one went to render any sort of aid or to check on the driver/passengers. \n\nWe think we're watching some dude burn to death on the side of the road and out of the middle of the grassy area in between the opposing lanes on highway 70, this fucking drunk shuffles out of grass and asks us if we're ok. He was drunk as a skunk, didn't have his seat belt on, and got flung out of the window into the grass as his winnebago was tumbling down the highway. Barely looked like he had a scratch on him.",

            "selftext": "This is going to be a very long post full of my personal hell from the last year, and is very poorly written. Please enjoy \ud83d\udc80\n\nI started working at an Ice Cream shop a couple months after I turned 15, found it off of a Facebook ad. They advertised $13-$15 an hour. They hired me on the spot, only to tell me the day after I started that 15 year olds only get $7.25 an hour until they turn 16. I still stayed for some reason. I was promoted to $15 an hour 3 months later because the owner liked me. Fast forward 6 months full of drama, the owner fires the manager, and the General Manager decides to leave. Leaving lil ole 15 year old me in the Manager position 1 month before I turn 16. The new general manager was incompetent, so I had to take half of the previous GM's responsibilities, on top of the old Managers responsibilities. While still getting paid the same $15 an hour (the previous manager was getting $20). When the owner caught wind that I wasn't happy about getting no pay increase for a massive new workload, he came in while I was being trained on cleaning the Ice Cream machines. He yelled about how easily replaceable I am, and how I won't make $15 an hour anywhere else. Going on about how ungrateful I am. So I planned to come in the next day and quit (I would've quit right then and there but I don't like to be impulsive). So I came in the next day, and he apologized, and told me how unchristlike it was of him to act that way, and how he promises to never do it again. So I decided to stay (stupid, I know). I turned 16, and we neared the end of the season. Next season starts and he asked me to come in a week early and do Ice Cream machine maintenance. I agree, and come in on Monday to start on the machines. But we didn't start on the machines. He asks me to come back to his office and he brings out his Bible. He starts reading a verse, and starts questioning me about sexual immorality. He goes on a rant about porn and premarital sex (making sure to let me know that he could've had all of the women he wanted when he was my age). I'm sure I was very clearly uncomfortable, but that didn't stop him. And for the next week, he had a Bible study every day. And the days that the General manager was there prepping for the season opening, he made me go sit in his car so she couldn't hear. He tried to question me and get me to confess sexual sins to him. Obviously I didn't say shit to this weirdo lmao. He promoted me to $20 an hour that week, so I dealt with the BS for the cash. I knew I wouldn't get that type of money anywhere else (as he reminded me daily). But then the problems with the General Manager started. She was horrible. Refused to work and instead of firing her, he pushed all of her responsibilities onto me. She was supposed to do the hiring and get interviews lined up. She didn't do shit, so he asked me to do it off the clock, I agreed because I didn't really have a choice. We were a week into the season, and she refused to get out the next months schedule. So he asked me to take over scheduling, and I agreed because that makes my life a lot easier. But the GM didn't like that. She called him the first time, and complained that she didn't have enough time off. So I fixed it, and asked her if theres anything else I should know about or fix. She said no and thanked me. The next day she called again to complain, but this time the owner had me listen to it while on speaker. She continued to lie, and claim that she's asked me to give her certain days off. and she said she doesn't feel comfortable with her \"assistant\" scheduling her. So at this point, I've had the scheduling, shopping, machines, inventory, and ordering thrown onto me (a 16 year old) and the only thing she has to do is money, but I'm her assistant? I came in the next day and quit. They both cried, she apologized, and they both asked me to stay, and the owner promised that he would fix things. I took the next week off and came back. Nothing changed. We were planning on firing the GM and having me take over. He backed out 3 times. She started a sob story about her boyfriend being emotionally abusive (he also works there) and used it to manipulate and get her way. The owner fired her boyfriend and claimed it was because I wanted him fired. So now I have this armed man pissed off at me, who I have to see daily because he picks this girl up from work. Over the last 2 months into this season he had started calling me at night after work for hours at a time. There were multiple times I was up at 1am with this dude when I had to be at work at 7am. And one of those nights he asked me if I was happy with my pay. I said no, and that I shouldn't be getting half of what the GM is getting when I'm doing all of the work. (With work 8 months out of the year, and 30 hours a week I was getting around $20k a year. She is salaried year round, for 45 hours a week, getting $40k.) He didn't like that. He broke out the ole Bible and told me that I was dead wrong, and read off the parable of the servants in the vineyard. He told me that he was disappointed with me, and that I need to record this and listen to myself because I am dead wrong. Even with all of this shit, I still went in the next morning at 7am, cleaned all of the machines, asked the Assistant Manager to come in at 1pm for opening, left my key and credit card on the desk, and texted him that I quit. I could've fucked him over hard, but I didn't. And the holy christian man has proceeded to demonize me to my old co-workers. I couldn't care less. I found a new job getting over $40k a year and couldn't be happier. Fuck you Jeff. ",

He claimed she just bolted away from him in the park, into some bushes and he could not find her.\n\nOur dog is quite small, a mini poodle mix and almost 13 years old, she is still active but it is really unlike her to run away from us and I was suspicious but chose to believe my husband and me and my daughter were in grief but did not want to blame him.\n\nWhen we came back home, he seemed surprisingly ok unlike us. Ever since the pandemic, my husband started working from home and he has always been annoyed at how much attention we gave Ellie and hated how Ellie begged to sit on our laps and his while he worked.\n\nA few days later we got a call from an animal rescue in a neighboring state quite far from us that she had been found. I picked the phone and it was on our landline which we almost never use these days but was the contact on the microchip.\n\nI told my husband and he just said \"that is great, I am so happy\" but it felt kind of blunt and insincere. I said it is strange that she got so far and he responded that someone must have stolen her and then abandoned her. This made little sense to me as to why that would happen.\n\nWhen he was out drinking with his buddies, I copied the videos from his dashcam for the days I was away and saw that he had indeed taken Ellie far out of state, and clearly dropped her in front of his car thrown a frisbee like object into a field, yelled fetch and drove off without her.\n\nI was livid and confronted him and he just stupidly muttered how he dropped her there so she could find a farm and have a better life and then the next day got really angry at me for viewing his dashcam and called me an my daughter AHs.",

He claimed she just bolted away from him in the park, into some bushes and he could not find her.\n\nOur dog is quite small, a mini poodle mix and almost 13 years old, she is still active but it is really unlike her to run away from us and I was suspicious but chose to believe my husband and me and my daughter were in grief but did not want to blame him.\n\nWhen we came back home, he seemed surprisingly ok unlike us. Ever since the pandemic, my husband started working from home and he has always been annoyed at how much attention we gave Ellie and hated how Ellie begged to sit on our laps and his while he worked.\n\nA few days later we got a call from an animal rescue in a neighboring state quite far from us that she had been found. I picked the phone and it was on our landline which we almost never use these days but was the contact on the microchip.\n\nI told my husband and he just said \"that is great, I am so happy\" but it felt kind of blunt and insincere. I said it is strange that she got so far and he responded that someone must have stolen her and then abandoned her. This made little sense to me as to why that would happen.\n\nWhen he was out drinking with his buddies, I copied the videos from his dashcam for the days I was away and saw that he had indeed taken Ellie far out of state, and clearly dropped her in front of his car thrown a frisbee like object into a field, yelled fetch and drove off without her.\n\nI was livid and confronted him and he just stupidly muttered how he dropped her there so she could find a farm and have a better life and then the next day got really angry at me for viewing his dashcam and called me an my daughter AHs.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*",
                "NTA o hell no he called your daughter an asshole wow!  get a good lawyer and keep the dashcam footage to use to include his lies and his cruelty.",
                "NTA, and only one question. How soon will your divorce be final?",
                "NTA. His dashcam isn't a sensitive viewing area. It's of the road in front of the car, and only a guilty person would be cranky about you watching it. Your husband sounds truly awful. Who does that to an dog, let alone an older dog. Does he have a heart?",
                "NTA. The only answer to this is immediate divorce. Holy shit.",
                "NTA\n\nKeep the dog and kid and lose the hubby. Drop him down the road a bit and hopefully he won't find his way back.",
                "NTA. This is the worst. He couldn't have rehomed her, taken her to the pound, sold her or even put her down at 13 but he decided to just abandoned her on the side of the road? Pets are not catered to the wild like that. She wouldn't have just \"found a farm\" it doesn't like work like that. She could have slowly starved to death or been injured and she was definitely alone and afraid so its just cruel. Your husband is also a moron for not even thinking about the microchip and how someone would call you.\n\nAnd on top of all that he lied to you about what happened. Do not trust this man.",
                "NTA:\n\n>clearly dropped her in front of his car thrown a frisbee like object into a field, yelled fetch and drove off without her.\n\nSo you're going to do the same to him right? \n\n>called me an my daughter AHs\n\nRight?",
                "Nta,\n\nBy seeing your comments  I'm happy to see he will not get away with it. I would've loved to see his face as he realizes his life is gonna fall apart for something he hoped he could fool you with.\n\nI love me a good pay back story!\n\nBut damn, this must hurt so much  for so many reasons.. I'm sorry to hear",
                "Obviously divorce him but be very careful with your dog! He might try to hurt her or get rid of her again out of anger, so make sure she\u2019s never left alone with him or even have her stay with a friend or family member until you can mov out.",

                "NTA - Any 'you spied on me' shit becomes a lot harder to claim when something like this is found.\n\nHe acted distrustful and because he's an imperfect liar you got suspicious. You found damning evidence of what he did. You didn't trust him and investigated because he was exhibiting guilt or fear of being caught. You had a *reason* to suspect him, and he *actually did something beyond AH and into Monster territory.*\n\nThis is 100% divorce territory.",

                "NTA op this is terrible most dogs would never survive in rural areas due to farmers just out right shooting animals they don\u2019t know or poison baits.  This is very concerning behaviour and for me personally would be a huge stepping stone towards divorce.",

                "I found 2 dogs recently who are obviously loved, well trained, well socialized,well taken care of and cherished animals. I had the passing thought an \"ex\" had taken them out of state and dumped them since no one seems to be looking for them and it doesnt make sense",

                "Obviously NTA. Not only did he abandon a defenseless animal, but he did it fully knowing the grief it would cause you and your child. That is deeply disturbing behavior in all ways and I hope you are able to get away from him as cleanly as possible. Also, I am so glad Ellie is safe.",
                "Dump your husband. NTA",
                "NTA. OMFG. For me, that marriage is over. I neither could, nor would, ever trust a person who could do that, to both the animal, and lie to your face about it? No effing way...",
                "NTA. Dogs are part of the family, and he dumped an elderly member of the family behind YOUR and your kid's backs. If he can do that behind your back, what else is he capable of? This is marriage ending stuff. Good luck",

And it took him all night to figure out a way to make it all your fault?\n\nNTA. You're married to an... unimpressive man with a cruel streak. Whoever found your dog and brought him to the shelter saved his life.",
                "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t be able to live with myself if I stayed with my husband after this. A dog is a family member, not something you can just toss away when you\u2019re bored. This is not minor, this is \u2018divorce him\u2019 stuff. Poor dog, I can\u2019t imagine how scared she must be when he abandoned her in an unknown place.",
                "NTA. I\u2019d divorce him, I\u2019m not kidding. And I know that\u2019s usually an extreme Reddit reaction. But my pet is my family and what he did absolutely just unacceptable and unforgivable, evil.\n\n\nEdit: saw in the comments that OP does plan to divorce him. Good.",

                "NTA.  If he is willing to do something like that, lie about it and express zero remorse, I would be concerned that he would go so far as to hurt your dog just to get rid of her.  I would not continue a relationship with a person like that.  He is weirdly and frighteningly jealous of your dog.",
                "NTA\n\nI would divorce someone like this. That she an extremely callous thing to do to a little old dog.",
                "NTA wow this is so cruel, I would be devastated someone I trusted would not only lie to me like this and get rid of my dog without my knowledge, but that he would be so cruel as to abandon her and endanger her the way he did. \n\nI don't blame you for checking the footage, he was acting suspiciously, and it turns out you were right.\n\nAside from the actual acts of animal cruelty he committed, it's deeply disturbing to me that he's so jealous of the attention you and your daughter give this dog that he would actually get rid of her. Also it pisses me off that he included a 7 year old child in calling you an asshole.",
                "NTA. Your husband is a dud. Also he\u2019s a major AH. Toss him out, keep the dog. Seems like a good idea to me. Seriously, anyone who treats animals like this can F off.",
                "NTA\n\nCall the cops and report him for animal cruelty.\n\nFrankly, that would be divorce for me",

He\u2019s only retaliating on you now because you caught him red handed.\n\nAnyone who is capable of doing this to an animal, let alone a beloved pet, is not worth your time or effort. These people are the worst and I swear they have no conscience.",

                "NTA. This makes me both sad and furious but at the same time, I couldn\u2019t stop laughing about your dog finding a farm and having a better life. Unbelievably selfish and cruel liar!",
                "NTA and you need to start referring to him as EX HUSBAND for tgis for he purposefully lied, harmed the dog, and has problems with you looking at his dashcam.   What else is he doing and or lying about?",
                "10/10 divorce him. He'd be lucky to not end up in a field with a limp lifeless body if he did that to my dog.",
                "NTA. Your (I hope soon to be ex) husband is a monster. He basically sentenced an old dog to death because she annoyed him. Divorce his ass, tell your daughter what he did, upload the video to the internet and send the link to everyone he knows. You can even use the footage as proof of animal abuse and endangerment. What he did was unforgettable and he should face consequences.",

Who calls their daughter an asshole for decisions they make as parents and why did you not immediately chastise him for that?\n\nNTA for checking the dashcam, he\u2019s just guilty he got caught. But Y will be TA if you don\u2019t have a serious conversation with him about why he lied, acted the way he did, and called your child an asshole.",
                "Your husband is a real\nMean person. What he did to the dog is heartbreaking. Your question is wrong in this thread. The question is should you call\nAnimal welfare about your husband. That\u2019s pet abondonement and abuse. Wonder what he will do to you or your child if you both get get sick and cannot take care of yourselves . Good luck.",

How could you ever trust such a lying piece of trash again? \n\nYour dog (the same age and breed as mine) has only known living in a house with a family. The dog would have just been prey in the wild, eaten alive by a larger animal eventually. I can\u2019t imagine how scared and confused the dog must have been. I hope you\u2019ve already thrown your husband out of your house. I think he must have some kind of mental illness to do this, but that\u2019s not your problem.

Insufferable, gross, yappy, pathetic and useless creatures. And yet, no matter how much I hate them, I\u2019d never do something so cruel. This is so far out there. What happened to a good old fashioned water squirter?

Look, the only reason for someone to get their panties in a bunch over the privacy of their phone is if they are keeping something secret from a partner, in which case, screw that person.

She\u2019s also got a lot going on with her ears\u2014mites, yeast, and bacterial infection. She\u2019s also got tapeworms. We are going to have fun with all her medications, but I\u2019m so happy I can get her started on the road to recovery. She\u2019s still a total sweetheart even after all the poking and prodding. The organization I\u2019m working with will be doing some additional testing and vaccinating next week. I\u2019m extremely lucky to be working with an organization that is covering her vet expenses. I am just going to be her foster mom until we can get her into rescue, but I will give her all the love she deserves while I have her. \n\nThanks everyone for your support of sweet Stella. I\u2019m especially grateful to the person that saw her get dumped and decided she was worth saving. He is the real hero of this tale. Like so many people have pointed out, a very terrible thing happened to her, but it has also shown that there is a lot of good in the world \u2764\ufe0f",

My parents took us to get a kitten from a shelter. There were plenty to choose from and my sister and I were arguing about which one to pick. My mom told us to knock it off because she picked out which one we were taking.\n\nHe was white with a black splash going down his head and back with a black tail too. A white face with a black nose and lips gave him a cartoonish cat smile. But what stood out to me most was his eyes were crusted shut and he had a dripping nose. He seemed to have a hard time eating because of this and was also scrawny and week. You could see his ribs and vertebrae.\n\nI asked my mom why she picked that one. It was sick and there were plenty of healthy ones to choose from. My mom told me that most kittens don't get adopted if they get to be too old. That this cat's illness was completely treatable and would clear up in a month but by that time he would be less small and cute so people would be less willing to adopt him. Finally she said that if you have the chance to help someone or something that needs it you always should.\n\nShe was right of course. We took him home with all the meds the shelter gave us. His sickness cleared up and he started gaining weight. He was the nicest cat I've had in my whole damn life.  He was friendly to everyone, even visitors. He would sit in your lap and purr so hard he'd start drooling. I had friends over to watch a movie and he would spend 2-3 minutes snuggling each guest before moving on to the next person. He knew we saved him and he payed us back with infinite love.\n\nIt looks like this cat will do the same for you.",

The wallet has been returned, it was left with the security guard at the entrance gate where I live.  \nBut thank you to everyone who took time to respond and give advice and their opinions on this situation. It was greatly appreciated. \n\nIn regards to the cards, and as to why I canceled them was because with my bank you get same day replacements. \n\nThe friendship has been ended it was a mutual agreement. I should have been more mindful of her red flags, and I should have taken into account that she was never really a friend and was more so using me.",

But, the car thing is really just a psychological handicap for me. Am I overthinking? Do most girls not care in the range 19-25?

I clean up after myself. \n\nIt\u2019s technically not \u201callowed\u201d but who gives a fuck. I\u2019m paying $3,000 a month. I\u2019m not the only one who does it either. I\u2019ve seen others spending hours on their cars out there. \n\nAnyone, this older lady (idk 70s?) moved upstairs above me. She\u2019s a Karen. Constantly in everyone\u2019s business and complaining about the dumbest shit.\n\nShe walked all the way over to me with her crusty white dog and asked if I know it\u2019s \u201cagainst the rules\u201d to do mechanics on your car in the lot. I\u2019m like \u201coh no I had no idea\u201d. \n\nShe angrily said she\u2019ll report me and called me disrespectful. I just ignored her and finished up. \n\nI see her speed walking over to the property manager\u2019s office. Next day I get a fine for $20 wedged in my door saying they received \u201can anonymous report\u201d I was working on my car. \n\nI was pissed off. The property manager, Dan (40\u2019s ?M) has rode over on his golf cart to chat with me while I was working on it in the past. He\u2019s very chill and doesn\u2019t care about most of the policies unless you are committing a crime or actively disturbing the peace. \n\nHe apologized said he unfortunately has to do it once someone puts in an official complaint, since his bosses will see it. They\u2019ll make a big stink if it\u2019s not dealt with. He told me he personally doesn\u2019t care. He suggested I to do it late at night when it\u2019s past Karen\u2019s bedtime. \n\nI was kinda fed up with her at this point. I asked if I can make an official report that \u201csomeone\u201d has a car in the lot that has had expired tags for the last month. (Karen\u2019s husband\u2019s car. He just just had surgery so they haven\u2019t been able to get it renewed at the DMV I guess). \n\nDan started laughing and was like \u201coh man really? that\u2019s devious brother\u201d. I said yeah put that shit in. Our state gives the right for private property owners to tow any car with expired tags without notice. \n\nThe car was towed the same day and she flipped the fuck out. It was hilarious. The cherry on top was Dan informing her he couldn\u2019t do anything because they had received an \u201cofficial complaint\u201d. \n\nI and a lot of neighbors are nosy and watched the whole debacle outside. I piped up and said it\u2019s unfortunate how \u201csome people need to learn to mind their own business and chill with the reporting\u201d. She started crying. Saying she doesn\u2019t have the money get it back since it\u2019s 300$ total. Too many bills with the surgery. Oops. \n\nI told my buddies. They think it\u2019s hilarious, but I\u2019ve also heard some of my friends call me a major asshole and went too far since she\u2019s old and taking care of her husband. They said 300$ was overkill when I was only fined 20$. Whatever. \n\nI think she had it coming. She was constantly reporting people for the dumbest things. I mean she screamed at little kids for coloring chalk on the sidewalk since it\u2019s \u201cagainst the rules\u201d. She also reported a teenager for keeping his bicycle on his balcony instead of the bike rack (it gets rusty out there with the rain). He\u2019s had is up there for years and never was a problem before she moved in. \n\nShe\u2019s been staying inside for the most part since, so no new reports have come in either. I kinda feel bad since she still hasn\u2019t gotten the car out of the impound though.\n\nAITAH?\n\n\nEdit: Just to defend Dan a bit here, he does enforce rules if you are actively fucking around. Like if kids are out here drawing slurs and dicks on the sidewalk, yeah he\u2019s gonna do something. But little girls drawing rainbows and flowers during their summer vacation? Of course not who fucking cares lol. (Except Karen, obviously).\n\nUPDATE: If anyone cares I saw the car in the lot this morning. I believe the grandson got it back for her. She still hasn\u2019t done her daily patrolling yet so maybe she learned her lesson!",

I love both of them but when he remarried within a year of the divorce I knew more than I needed to know.  \n\nI live close to both my folks and they both have keys to my house in case of emergency. \n\nMy half brother (18) still lives with my father and his mother. He seems like a good enough kid but he is my dad's son not my brother.  \n\nI just went on vacation to Brazil for a couple of weeks. When I got back my car stunk. I almost threw up from the reek. \n\nI found a piece of chicken breast rotting in my car. \n\nI don't buy raw chicken breast to eat. I hate the way it feels. I buy it prepared and fully cooked. \n\nI asked my mom about it and she had no clue. I asked my father and he told me that he borrowed my car, which he is allowed to do, and used it to get groceries. \n\nI told him that he had to pay someone to clean my fucking car. I got ahold of a detailing company but they said that the smell was in my upholstery and I would probably need to get it replaced.  \n\nI told my dad and he said that he couldn't afford that. I called my insurance company and asked if I was covered in any way. They said that if my car had been used without my permission I could report it as stolen and they would cover it. \n\nI told my dad and he lost it. He admitted that his son had taken my keys and used my car. And that if I reported it stolen he would get in trouble and it would affect his college admission. \n\nI gave my father four choices, pay to replace the upholstery in my car and guarantee the smell was gone, buy the car from me at full market value so I could replace it, give me his car to use until the smell went away, or I would report the car as having been stolen. \n\nSince the only extra money he has is his son's college fund he is in a bind. I told him I was taking his car until he decided. I grabbed both sets of keys and left. I also took my emergency key back and changed the locks at my house. \n\nHis wife has been hounding me because they have to drive around in a stinking car. I told her that I could report it as stolen and have her thief son deal with the consequences. She has had to start taking Ubers everywhere because she can't handle the stench. My dad is close to cracking and using his kid's money to pay for my car. \n\nI feel like an asshole and that family thinks I am but my car was only a year old and I loved it.",

            "selftext": "Sorry for the late night post as I\u2019ve been at work all day. My (39M) daughter is 17 years old. She\u2019s been dating her 18 year old boyfriend for 6 months. Good guy, no issues with him. I have the typical rules like no boy in the bedroom, stay in the living room, no inappropriate stuff, have her home by 10pm, etc. I like to think me and my daughter have an open relationship. I\u2019m always comfortable talking to her calmly and answering all of her \u201cwhys.\u201d I always provide good reasoning behind everything I say. Since she was 12/13 years old, we started having talks about boys, puberty, sex. It was never a one-time talk. We would always have these discussions whenever I saw fit. I\u2019ve explained how teen sex is not a good idea, why it\u2019s not a good idea, and the risks of it. I\u2019ve talked about all of the people who had sex at a young age and regret it, the guys who use girls for sex, and how the teenage brain is not ready to handle mature activities like that. I had these talks when she started dating her boyfriend as well. She seemed receptive to what I had to say which I appreciated. \n\nHowever, last week I ended up finding condoms in her car. When I confronted her she tried to lie about it. I kept questioning until she admitted to me that they\u2019re having sex. I thanked her for telling the truth and we spoke again. I asked her what she thinks a fair punishment would be and obviously she didn\u2019t want one. I told her I won\u2019t give her a long term punishment, but I think a 2 week grounding plus some new rules is fair. One of those being that no one except her friends or a family member is to be in her car. \n\nThat means, no boyfriend in her car and vice versa. If they\u2019re going on a date then I will drop her off and pick her up. No exceptions at all, she can\u2019t be in his car and vice versa. She was really upset by this and said they have a lot of serious/important talks in their cars. She said it\u2019s also nice to hang out. I told her I understand but they can simply have those talks  on the phone or hang here where I can keep an eye on them. I explained that actions have consequences. She\u2019s been really upset by this and isn\u2019t speaking to me. AITAH? I thought I was being fair.",

It\u2019s a materials thing. \n\nSteel bolts are heavy, and in the old days of F1 they\u2019d go as far as to drill a hole through the center to reduce weight (hollow cylinders are actually just as strong as solid ones when designed right). But we don\u2019t see that here\u2014suggesting this isn\u2019t steel. \n\nThey\u2019re definitely machining this bolt out of titanium or magnesium to save weight. Both of which are MUCH MUCH harder to machine than steel. They perform differently when you try to cut them, meaning the machinists need to completely alter their setups or use machines designed around cutting those specific materials. It\u2019s just not cost effective for a bolt company to make 30 TOTAL specialty bolts for an F1 team who needs just enough for 2 working cars and then some spares. \n\nThey likely buy all their small bolts from a normal manufacturer, but these big suckers are made in-house due to low volumes and difficult-to-machine materials. \n\nSource: aviation mechanical engineer.

            "selftext": "I have posted this to four other Tesla related subreddits only to have them removed so hopefully this one sticks..\n\nI have had a horrible experience with Tesla and their team in the past couple of days. My family purchased our new car a couple months ago and was enjoying it up until a few days ago when I tried to get the car into gear and it demanded that I input the password. Having not set up a password previously, I contacted Tesla about the issue. \n\nWhile I was waiting to speak with a representative, I noticed that my car was no longer linked to my account on the app, nor could I log into my Tesla account. After waiting on hold for two hours, I was finally able to get through to a representative who informed me that I needed to contact Tesla Financial about this issue. I called the number provided immediately but they did not pick up as they were outside of working hours.\n\n\u201cNot a problem.\u201d I thought. I\u2019d call back again tomorrow and sort this out. I left my car in the parking lot at work overnight and had a family member pick me up and drop me off the next morning. While I\u2019m working the next day, my boss informs me that there is a tow truck outside to tow my car. Confused, I went out to the parking lot and was told by the towing company that Tesla is repossessing my vehicle. \n\nThis is where my confusion grew. We had paid for the vehicle IN FULL at the time we picked it up from the dealership, but the towing company is just doing what tesla told them to do. so they took my car.\n\nShortly afterward, my father received a phone call from Tesla Financial and he asked them what was going on. They told him that Tesla had been trying to reach out to us multiple times through phone and email about a debt they have been attempting to collect on the car. \n\nMy father had been out of the country for the past couple months so any phone calls would not have reached him. He did not receive a single voicemail about this issue either. He looked through his emails and noticed that he did in fact receive only two emails on July 27 and July 28, stating that we had not yet paid for the car and that the full cost of the vehicle is still at large. These emails went ignored as he believed them to be a phishing attempt because we had already PAID IN FULL at the dealership. He also believed that Tesla could not have made such a huge mistake like this.\n\nMy father explained this over the phone but the representative did not budge. This Tesla representative was rude and unprofessional for the entire phone call\u2014going so far as to yell at my father over the phone.\n\nA different Tesla representative sent us an email that seemed to be a copy paste of what they had sent my father back in July and that this car is now being considered for repossession. I shot an email back explaining AGAIN that this car had been paid for in full already and that we have been very dissatisfied by how Tesla had been handling this situation.\n\nUp until this point, we were under the impression that Tesla was repossessing our vehicle without any warning because the two emails they sent to us regarding this seemed to be a phishing scam. Again they left no voicemails about this either. \n\nThe Tesla representative then emailed back this statement:\n\n\u201cI am having the team fully post the funds of the cashier's check. I am redrafting the documents and title/lien to your name instead of [BANK]. I have attached documents. Once funds post I can then restore access to the vehicle and release title/lien to your name.\u201d\n\nBasically saying that they had the check this whole time but due to some internal oversight had not cashed it. And they came after us, accused us of not paying, and repossessed our vehicle. Not only that, they incorrectly had the title of our car under the bank\u2019s name rather than our own.\n\nThe next day, we received another email stating that the car is now back under our name and it can be picked up from the tow yard. \n\nNo apology. No restitution. \n\nMy father emailed them back saying he was glad the issue was resolved but was disappointed that there was no restitution offered, not even an apology. \n\nThey then emailed back the equivalent of saying \u201cwell we did try to contact you about this.\u201d \n\nI shot back an email stating that we are frustrated because it seems like this was an internal accounting issue that we should not have been contacted about or been involved in, in the first place. \n\nNow we find ourselves carless for four days and will have to go out of our way to pick up a car that was wrongly repossessed. \n\nAnd still Tesla offers no apology, restitution, and no guarantee that they are taking steps to prevent anything like this from happening in the future.\n\nEDIT: the car was paid for with a combination of card and CASHIER\u2019S check. Cashiers check means the amount of money is withdrawn from the bank when it\u2019s ISSUED not cashed. so no, we did not notice extra money sitting in our account because it had already been withdrawn.\n\nUPDATE: we got the car back today and there is no damage to it. we have been talking about getting an attorney or at least taking this to small claims court but in the end the decision comes down to what my dad wants to do as he owns the car. \n\nwill probably not be updating again because i\u2019m tired of thinking about this but we\u2019ll see. i\u2019m really upset with tesla and would return the car if i could.",

            "title": "AITA for giving my son my daughters college money so he can buy a new car?",
            "selftext": "First time poster. My son told me to post on here because quite there is a rift in our household right now. \n\nHere are the key details you should know. My son (23) has always worked very hard and earlier this year purchased a GMC for 30K. This was a big deal to him because before that he was still driving the old Chrysler he got after his grandma passed away. \n\nSecond key detail is that my wife and I have been saving for our kids\u2019 college when they were young. My son has graduated college and that money has mostly been used up. I think it\u2019s about 50K that each of them received or will receive in the case of my daughter who is 16. \n\nMy son went out of town last weekend to visit friends. That is when this incident went down. Sometime after my wife and I fell asleep on Friday night, my daughter snuck out at night and took his car. My wife and I got a call from the police at close to 3 AM telling us that my daughter and 3 friends were in custody after they had ran the car up a curb, knocking down a street sign and colliding with a tree. They were speeding recklessly, and to top it all off, my daughter wasn\u2019t even driving but they all had been drinking too. Car is totaled.  Since she wasn\u2019t the driver she avoided the DUI but was charged with underage drinking as well as a curfew violation. \n\nI\u2019m going to skip the part where we picked her up from the police station and conversations because it\u2019s not relevant. when my son arrived home he was crushed. So without thinking anything of it, I told my son to go buy a new one and I will be transferring the money from his sisters college fund so he can buy a new one.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t able to find the same great deal on the same year with similar mileage. He used almost 40K to get a 2022 model And I was fine with it. This left his sisters fund with about 15K left. It is her dream to go to a big school in the south, which now seems like a pipe dream unless she takes out big loans. \n\nNaturally, she\u2019s been in hysterics about the college fund and thinking I\u2019m going too hard. She currently hates me, her mom (who is on my side) and brother for spending the money when \u201che could have gotten a cheaper car\u201d. \n\nLikely, she will need to go a cheaper school. Most likely go to community college for 2 years first too to save money. This broke her because she has been set on the particular school since she was in middle school (she has a lot of clothes and even bed sheets of her dream school) so I understand this is tough on her. \n\nIMO she\u2019s lucky to be alive after this stunt, so having her college plans change is a small price to pay imo. My sister and some others are very upset with my wife, son and I. Saying that it sucks, but college is more important than the car. \n\nThe car is bought, the money is spent, the situation is more or less over. So am I an asshole for this? My daughter is currently spouting the \u201cI\u2019m moving out at 18 and never talking to you again\u201d crap but her mom and I think that will blow over.\n\nEdit: we will make up the extra money taken for sons new car. We had to spend that because what he was looking for was hard to find, but by the time she goes to college we will have made up that extra money and I will make that promise to her.\n\nEdit 2: so many people bringing up insurance. Here\u2019s what my son had to say about that since he spoke to them. He is the only insured driver, so the kid driving wasn\u2019t insured. The alcohol is a factor too. The car also wasn\u2019t reported stolen so they can\u2019t be sure he didn\u2019t give them permission to take it. It\u2019s he said she said. He\u2019s getting a few grand back which is going to daughters fund.",

                "I'm going to need a source on this idea. I think most people have those bumper stickers to be funny and there isn't a deeper meaning behind it. The exception being the pun \"honk if your horny\"",
                "Just to be clear, **that take is completely wrong**. It sounds like someone younger trying to reverse-explain behaviors they've seen but don't know any of the history on.\n\nYes, \"Honk if you like ____\" is literal. It's not expected everyone will do it, but you'll often get a cheer or friendly wave-back if you do a short single-tap honk. It's a driving game similar to how kids will try to get commercial trucks to pull their horns when passing.\n\nHowever, in the last 20 years the general social tolerance for public noise has been going down a lot. A big factor is that the US population has more than doubled since the 60s, so the traffic volume on many roads has gone up dramatically and local residents have been overwhelmed by the increased road noise levels.\n\nAs a result, unnecessary honking is now treated as nuisance noise in residential or downtown areas across most cities and there can be local laws against it. There's also been an effort to frame it as a safety hazard and discourage drivers from causing distractions with it, so honking has gained a minor social stigma on par with not having your phone on silent in a public place. \n\nMost drivers now will avoid responding to the honk stickers **unless they're on an open highway or other area where it doesn't cause a noise nuisance**. A lot of city kids especially don't get out on the open highways often, so I wouldn't be surprised if familiarity with the practice has gone way down.",

In the late 1970s and 1980s I had witnessed on many occasions people actually honking in response to these signs and bumper stickers. It was a different time back then \u2014 it was not uncommon to honk when you arrived at someone\u2019s house to pick them up. And people honked as a greeting sometimes when passing people they knew on the street.\n\nBut, somewhere in time, honking became seen as a nuisance and was banned in many places except for emergencies.

I told him that he can use the space he has at home to open a car wash and he doesn\u2019t necessarily need to use all his money to open a business as simple as that. \n\nHe said the vision he has is to also include auto detailing and that he would use the money to purchase equipment for it. \n\nI told him that I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea - but I\u2019ll support him if he decides to do it. \n\nHe then said that he\u2019s happy I\u2019m on his side because he wants us to do something together. \n\nI thought he meant me helping with his business - but no. He explained that his idea of \u201ctogether\u201d is me taking out a loan for a car that will be on MY NAME but he will drive it because I don\u2019t drive. \n\nWhen I asked who will be making the payments, he said the bank will take the money out of my account every month and he will pay half. \n\nI told him that I am absolutely NOT paying half for a car I am not driving. He said it would be \u201cour\u201d car and that when I eventually get my license, I\u2019ll be able to drive it too. \n\nI said that this entire scenario makes no sense as I have no intention of driving anytime soon - and literally anything can happen. \n\nI asked if we break up, what then? \n\nHe said even if we break up, he will continue paying for his share of the share so I won\u2019t bare that payment. When I asked why he can\u2019t just pay for the full payment he said he plans to leave his job and do his car wash / detailing business full time so he won\u2019t be able to cover the full payment until his business takes off.\n\nI told him that I\u2019m sorry but I can\u2019t take out a loan for him - nor put a car in my name when he is so unstable. He called me a \u201cselfish AH\u201d - one he \u201ccan\u2019t see a future with\u201d and left. Now, he won\u2019t speak to me. My mom says I\u2019m in the right but now I feel bad because if I don\u2019t take out the loan, he won\u2019t be able to. AITA?\n\n**UPDATE**\nHi guys, thank you so much for giving your opinions, stories, advice - everything! I truly appreciate it and it helped make my decision a lot easier.\n\nSo, he called me earlier and broke up with me on the basis of \u201cpartners are supposed to share everything\u201d and he can\u2019t trust me to \u201chold him down when he\u2019s down.\u201d After an ear full about how I \u201cthink I\u2019m better than him because of my job,\u201d how I \u201clook down on him,\u201d and how I \u201cdon\u2019t want to see him be successful,\u201d I called his mom (we\u2019re very close) and let her know that we broke up and why we broke up. \n\nShe was very upset to say the least - but reassured me that I made the right decision. She said that she told him not to sell the car but he went ahead and did it anyway. \n\nAfter we spoke, she wished me well and I went to get something to eat. \nI guess she told him something about it because he texted me shortly after. I\u2019m just going to copy and paste what he said:\n\n**TEXT CONVO** \n\nHim: How childish do you have to be to call my mom?\n\nMe: I wanted her to know that we broke up and why.\n\nHim: Just say you wanted to manipulate her and make her believe I\u2019m trying to leech off of you. WHAT HAVE YOU EVER FONE FOR ME? TELL ME\n\nHim: You know what\u2019s sad? You were supposed to be the person I could come to for ANYTING. I had my own car something YOU NEVER HAD and I sold it because it was getting to expensive and I wanted something more efficient. YOU KNOW THAT so I don\u2019t know why you trying to fuck up what my family thinks about me and make me look like I BEGGING you for car.\n\nHim: SMH you are the biggest asshole and the most selfish person I ever met\n\nHim: Why couldn\u2019t you just be happy for me? Why couldn\u2019t you just believe in my dreams? You really think I would leave you after you got a car for me? You have no common sense and that\u2019s why people will USE you. You to dumb for an educated woman and that\u2019s why we broke up. Go tell her that\n\n**END OF TEXT CONVO** \n\nYeah\u2026 lol. I didn\u2019t respond to any of those messages. But I did get a massive headache immediately after reading them. \n\nAnyway, thanks a lot for all your help guys! I really really appreciate it!",

                "Depends on what state you\u2019re in. If your state is like Texas you can insist on a jury trial when you plead not guilty to the charge. Usually that is when a trial date is set and you can request a jury trial. In situations like yours, juries are your friend. \n\nAt that time you can submit a request to depose the officer and the trainee separately, as well as request the dash cam video and all recorded evidence. Body cams, training records of the trainee. Make the request broad enough to cover all recorded evidence made for a time window 30 minutes prior to the ticket and for several hours after the ticket. You may find a discussion between officer and trainee. It\u2019s almost certain that you\u2019ll find evidence to support your claim as well as other behavior the officer doesn\u2019t want you to show a jury.\n\nDepose the officer and the trainee separately and ask them both to give a detailed account of their day leading up to the time you were given the ticket. Ask the trainee to describe conversations he had with the senior officer about the ticket and ask him about other experiences with this supervisor. See if other officers have been involved in his training, doing this in a deposition let\u2019s you know if you want to use the evidence in a trial. If you can get either officer to admit mistakes or if you can find recorded evidence that supports your version of events, you will likely get your ticket dropped.\n\nHaving a lawyer is safer, but make sure he aggressively defends you and doesn\u2019t just take a plea.\n\nThe truth is, the police know most people either can\u2019t afford to hire a lawyer to fight a ticket or are too lazy to put in the work to defend themselves. At the same time, most district attorneys and judges are elected officials. They tend to be more lenient to a citizen/potential voter in their court room.\n\nThe biggest risk you likely have is losing and having to pay the fine as well as potentially paying court costs. \n\nMake your case and good luck.",

Strong EV offerings.  Segment leader or near leader in several categories.  Incredible value proposition.  \n\n\nThe worst decline: BMW\n\nThe face.  The weight.  The face.  Arguably, no longer a leader in any one segment.  \n\nThat face.\n\n\nEDIT: Wow, this discussion blew up.  So many awesome, educated, well thought out responses befitting this community.  \n\nAfter reading all the responses, the opinion of this community seems to be that either Hyundai/Kia or Mazda improved the most.   The Hyundai/Kia had some very vocal dissenters.  IMHO, if you take a look at the cars they produced in the 80s and 90s, and to see how far they have come (plus, from a mid sized country with no auto roots), it\u2019s growth is nothing short of astounding.  Some other interesting responses I thought were Tesla, Alfa, and the Chinese automakers like BYD. \n\nOne the regression side, a lot of people also mentioned BMW but like the Hyundai/Kia vote, it was very divisive. Everyone, including the BMW die-hands agreed about the looks.  If there was a clear winner in this category (or, loser) it would have to go to Nissan or Mitsubishi.  For my BMW vote, the car company has always been the sports alternative to luxury-minded Benz.  But I think it lost way a bit. Now, it\u2019s more focused on luxury, trying to compete for more volume in the Benz and Audi, space. And before, it had clear class leaders in its lineup\u2026.the 3, the 5, the X5, etc. Now I\u2019d argue, it\u2019s not a clear leader in any one category.  In hindsight tho, I would have picked Nissan.  \n\nOther notable responses include Chrysler and Jaguar/Land Rover (which I can\u2019t disagree with either). \n\nThanks for responding\u2026have a good day!",

            "selftext": "I just drove to my Dad's house and back.  On the way back I came across a car that had rolled into a ditch.   I stopped and ran up to the car only to come upon a terrible sight I'm not going to detail.  I started to call 911 and heard a gurgling breath.  It was hard to tell since they were halfway out of the car but they were trying to talk.  I told them it was ok that I called for help and to try to relax.  It was obvious they weren't going to make it much longer.  I have absolutely no idea how they were still conscious whatsoever honestly.   I'm still shaking.  I have seen some terrible things.   I have witnessed a violent death before but this was different because I was standing at the edge of a beautiful field that overlooks our local lake.   It was totally silent.  No other vehicles passed by for at least the first ten minutes.  My ears were ringing, my arms were totally numb and it's like I wasn't even really there.   \n\nSo I just knelt down and told them they weren't alone.  They kept trying to talk and their one eye that I could see was darting around.  I didn't know what else to do after calling 911 and I left the phone on the call so they could track it.  I told them I was setting my phone down.  I started looking for their phone but what I saw from the other side of the car was even worse.   It's a bright sunny day outside.   This is on a somewhat secluded road but I know plenty of volunteer fire dept people live within just a few miles. One of them just up the road.   They beat the cops there.  It was such a relief seeing him show up and he's seen this sort of thing dozens of times but I'll never forget the shock in his face when he walked through the ditch up to the car.  \n\nI was given a card and some information about free counseling.  They stopped questioning me because I had trouble hearing anyone speak to me for some reason.  One of the volunteers drove me home in my car and had someone follow me.  I don't know what to think.  I hope I brought the person some peace and I was going to try do something to physically help them but I just couldn't.  Their insides weren't with them anymore and part of their head was gone.  They were driving an early 90s Geo Tracker.  Not a very safe vehicle to say the least.   They must have blown a tire and rolled it or clipped the shoulder.  It looked like the rolled it about five or six times from what I could tell.  \n\nI'm not religious but I prayed with them.  I just assumed they were since most people in the area are.  I hope I did the right thing doing that.  I said the Lord prayer and then something I said as a child before bed \"Now I lay me down to sleep.  If I die before I wake, pray the Lord my soul to keep\".  I feel like an idiot for doing that for some reason.  By the time the volunteer showed up they said they took a few \"agonal breaths\" but that was it.   \n\nWhat do I do?  The county Sheriff told me the family may want to talk to me.  He knows the family.  He gave me his card and said I could talk to him anytime as well.  What do I even say?  What happens when the reach out to me?   Are they going to?   I found someone after they ended their own life with a shotgun but this was so much worse because they were still there.  This person was aware.   I just know it.  I wish I knew what they wanted to say.   At least for a few moments.  It was just so silent besides the ticking metal sounds from the car.  There's no way the family wants to know any details.  If I talk to them so I just tell them I was there and let them know they weren't alone?",

That they seemed awake at first and not alone, that you recited the Lords Prayer with them. You can also just say that they were not able to say anything, but that you did not think that they were in pain.

If the family do want to speak to you, then yeah, all you need to say is that he wasn\u2019t alone. \n\nI\u2019m so so sorry that you\u2019ve went through this",

Shock may very well set in soon, and being hydrated will make it a little easier to recover from. \n\nSecond: surround yourself with comfort items. Warm blankets, soft pillows, comforting scents, etc. \n\nThird: practice grounding yourself. Look around the room and count 5 things you can see, 4 things you can hear, 3 things you can touch, 2 things you can smell and one thing you can taste. Repeat as needed. \n\nEat small snacks as you can tolerate. Sugar can be helpful. \n\nWhen this really sets in and hits you-let it. Don\u2019t fight it. Feel everything you need to feel, allow yourself to release it. Take any resources offered to you so that you can process this trauma. \n\nFeel free to reach out OP, I\u2019ve been in this situation more than a few times (as my username implies) and would be happy to listen if you need it.

Please know that you did everything you could and then some. \n\nAs everyone else here has mentioned, take care of you, which starts with the basics (eat some food, drink water, try to sleep if you can). Find some help and someone to talk to, bonus points if it\u2019s someone with training and experience in helping people with trauma.\n\nIf and when you feel like you\u2019re up to speaking the the family, they likely just want to hear that their loved one was not alone at the end, that someone was there with them and caring for them and being kind. They may want to know if the person suffered, but really they want to know that the person didn\u2019t suffer. So I wouldn\u2019t volunteer that information but if they ask, you can say something like \u201cthey didn\u2019t seem to be suffering or aware of the situation\u201d or something that\u2019s not totally a lie but also maybe not the full truth. Definitely spare them the details. \n\nThe family is also experiencing trauma. None of you are quite yourselves right now and probably most things don\u2019t really seem quite real. That phone call will probably have more impact if it happens a few days from now, when you can speak more articulately and they can process a little better. But also you are under no obligation to speak with them. You can relay a message through the sheriff if you\u2019d like, since he knows them.\n\nBasically, take care of you first, since you can\u2019t help anyone if you\u2019re not functional. Then see how you\u2019re feeling about a call, leave it light on details and heavy in comfort, and definitely find some kind of therapy that can help you deal with what you\u2019ve been through.",

IMO, when I started as a first aid attendant, I was told at the beginning, \"If all you do is simply be there with them and hold their hand, that is enough.\"  That is what you did.  You were a comforting presence in the final moments, that's huge.  And you should be fine telling his family just that, when you are ready.",

I was the one who called 911, but I wasn't alone - there were several others who stopped as well. I watched him pass away and all that too... It sucked.\n\nI'm so sorry you had to witness this awful scene. You sound like such a kind soul, and everything you did was perfect. You offered comfort. Not everyone would have been able to do that.\n\nMy biggest piece of advice is to see a trauma-informed therapist. My second biggest piece of advice is to stop retelling the story if you can. Your brain wants to keep dissecting it, but it's not super helpful. You can talk it out with a therapist. Don't let others pressure you into gory details either - people are nosy and may not have ill intentions, but that doesn't mean they're entitled to details. \n\nAlso, I just want to throw this out there, you don't HAVE to do anything with or say anything to the family of you are uncomfortable. You can write them a letter, or you can tell them you need more time. You can even just say you can't talk to them. You are allowed to pause and heal. \n\nAgain, I'm sorry you had to witness that.

There may come a time when they will want to know. I really don't. They might.\n\nYou were in deep shock, is why you couldn't hear what they were saying. You may need to talk to someone about what you saw and felt. It's hard to be the one person after a terrible accident.

She offered to meet up with us to talk, and im not sure if my mom ever did. But it gave me peace knowing that she wasnt alone in her last moments. Someone cared about her and stayed. A complete stranger who didnt have to stop, Did. I think of that woman as an angel. \n\nIf you feel the need, write them a letter and say (With less detail) what you said here. That you stayed, prayed with them. That you comforted them and called for help. That you Cared for them, and they werent alone. You were an angel for this person and their family.

So you don't have nightmares or flashbacks later because you flooded that part of your brain with Tetris instead.\n\nGo play Tetris for a day or two.",

A passerby stopped as you did and stayed with their relative while they died. None of the family were even in the same country. The passerby contacted the family and said they had stopped and stayed with the relative and held their hand. It brought the family so much comfort because they knew their loved one hadn't died alone. In that case, the passerby hadn't witnessed anything so upsetting as you did - minimal visual injuries - so it is fine if you don't feel up to doing that. The police may already have told  their loved ones that someone was there. But if you want to pass that on, from the one similar situation I have heard of, it brought comfort. \n\nI am so sorry again OP.

                "I'm so sorry you had to experience this traumatic event. Witnessing such a tragedy can be deeply distressing, and your feelings and reactions are completely valid. Here are some steps and considerations to help you navigate this difficult situation:\n\n1. **Take Care of Yourself First**: Before anything else, it's essential to prioritize your well-being. It's okay to seek professional help or counseling to process the trauma. The fact that you were offered free counseling is a good sign that the responders recognized the potential impact on you. It might be beneficial to take advantage of that offer.\n\n2. **Speaking with the Family**: If the family reaches out to you, it's likely because they want to understand their loved one's final moments and find some closure. Here's what you might consider:\n   - **Prepare Mentally**: Before speaking with the family, take some time to gather your thoughts and emotions. It might be helpful to write down what you want to say or discuss it with someone you trust.\n   - **Be Honest but Gentle**: If you choose to speak with them, be honest about your experience but avoid graphic details. Focus on the comfort you provided and the fact that their loved one was not alone.\n   - **Listen**: Sometimes, the family might just want someone to listen to them. Be there as a supportive presence, even if it means just listening.\n   - **Respect Their Wishes**: If they don't wish to speak or hear details, respect their decision.\n\n3. **Religious Considerations**: You did what you felt was right in the moment by praying with the individual. Many people find comfort in prayer during traumatic events, and it's likely that your intentions were felt, even if the person couldn't communicate.\n\n4. **Legal and Official Inquiries**: It's possible that you might be contacted for an official statement or inquiry, given that you were a witness. If this happens, just provide the facts as you remember them. The sheriff offering his card is a gesture of support, indicating that you can reach out if you have questions or concerns.\n\n5. **Join a Support Group**: Consider joining a support group for trauma survivors or those who have witnessed traumatic events. Sharing your feelings and experiences with others who have gone through similar situations can be therapeutic.\n\n6. **Remember**: It's okay to feel a range of emotions, from guilt to sadness to confusion. Everyone processes trauma differently. It's essential to give yourself time and space to heal.\n\nLastly, you showed immense compassion and courage by staying with the individual during their final moments. It's a testament to your character and humanity. Remember to lean on your support system, whether it's friends, family, or professionals, during this challenging time.",

He would often tell me hell no, and they suffered terribly. But there is absolutely no reason to tell that to the family.

You don't have to do anything. By being there, you did more for someone than many of us will do in our lives. Just take care of yourself in whatever ways help, now.\n\nI think what's important as far as the family is concerned, is just that they know their loved one wasn't alone. And you don't have to talk to them to tell them that---the sheriff probably already did. They don't need to know the details-in fact it might be better that they don't.\n\nIn fact, I recommend going to the counseling for a while before talking directly to the family (and you don't ever have to talk to them if you're not ready).",

You were with someone in their last moments on earth and it is beautiful and traumatic. This happened to me when I was a senior in high school. Two transfer trucks almost hit me but hit another car instead. I instantly ran to the car and called 911, but after a few minutes of telling her I was there and it was okay, I checked her pulse and she was gone. It truly traumatized me but I didn\u2019t realize it until a couple of months later. Be sure to take care of yourself. Talk to someone about it. You did a courageous thing. Be kind to yourself. But as for talking to the family, just letting them know that you were there for them during their last moments will mean the world to them. Knowing that they weren\u2019t alone. I hope things get better friend",

I\u2019ve had ptsd for many years now and I wish I knew about some of these things earlier to try and help myself. I definitely will try some new things now to help myself and I hope you do that too. You\u2019re not alone in this and you\u2019ll feel better once you clear your mind. Don\u2019t worry about having conversations with their family right now.

Leave the gory details out, like you said. I would want to know that you were there if my loved one was in an accident.\n\nPlease get counseling.

He was on a motorbike and made the call to cut a blind corner whilst travelling way above the speed limit. The accident was inevitable, and seeing his body on the road is something I will never forgot, even 30 years ago.  I remember much of that morning like it was yesterday. Watching someone die is the hardest thing, the most important thing at this point is yourself, you need to take of you, speak to a family member or a friend, have a cry and try not to be alone. Being with someone will help greatly. If you have numbers for support services in your area, call them too, sooner rather than later as the earlier you are on the right path the better you will be.  \n\nIf the family want to talk, give it a bit of time. You need to process this, you are the most important thing now, and you need to make sure that you are safe and taken care of.",

First thing the lawyer I worked for would ask to the victim or a witness or another family member was \u201chave you spoken to a someone about what happened?\u201d He always had a number of therapists to recommend, because he understood the importance of properly expressing and dealing with these things. Even if it isn\u2019t necessarily therapy, do not keep this bottled up. What you saw was something no one should ever have to experience, and I am truly sympathetic to you, OP. Also no I don\u2019t think it was the wrong thing to say the Lord\u2019s Prayer.

This took a big psychological toll on me and I\u2019m just not ready to talk yet. I imagine they would understand. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t go into any nitty gritty details when you do talk to them; keep things as positive as possible even though there\u2019s very little positive to discus.

It can be easy to feel guilty about things you wish you did differently. Try to understand that you had the best intentions for this person. There\u2019s no way to prepare yourself mentally or physically for such a situation, we cannot beat ourselves up for how we react. \n\nMy experience: Approximately one month ago, we witnessed a college student on a rentable scooter get hit by a car and killed. It wasn\u2019t as gruesome as you are describing, so I can only imagine part of how you\u2019re feeling. The other person I was with is a surgical ICU nurse, she sees horrible stuff like that all the time. However, she said, seeing the actual event with your own eyes was way tougher. We couldn\u2019t drive afterwards, we had to walk around until we stopped shaking. It\u2019s a month later and I think about it every single day, multiple times. It traumatized me, but she did 99% of the care for the young man, I can\u2019t imagine how she is feeling, similar to you. \n\nDon\u2019t feel guilty for feeling hurt/pain, even though you were not physically hurt. What you witnessed will likely cause some PTSD. Be patient with yourself in your healing process.

Sounds like you were in shock which is understandable considering the circumstances, most people will not be able to comprehend being in a situation like that.  My advices is take the therapy even if it\u2019s not affecting you now it will sometime later down the road to your life.  It\u2019s up to you to see the family but I recommend sorting yourself out before seeing them.",

Sometimes knowing things like that can honestly cause more harm than good. (I used to work in a place where we ran funerals/memorial services.) \n\nI would also seriously recommend that you seek out someone you can talk to about your experience. Even if you think you\u2019re fine now, and even if you are completely fine going forward, these things can stick with you and come racing back to your mind when you least expect it. You did a wonderful thing in a horrific situation. I\u2019ve had many awful accidents happen in front of my house. They are always difficult. Nothing ever prepares you.

Not all of those passings are peaceful, some are palliations at the 11th hour, and some are traumatic deaths that we have reached a ceiling with what we can do for them.\nWhat you are going through is shock. What you went through at the scene is shock. It is entirely a normal reaction, and you did absolutely nothing wrong. First and foremost, you need to protect your own mental health. Please speak to a professional, what you experienced is absolutely cause for PTSD. Play Tetris, it has been proven to reduce risk of PTSD after a traumatic event. \nWhat you did at the scene was provide that person with company for their last moments alive. You provided them with some comfort in hearing that somebody cares for them. You provided them with relief that their family will know where they are, that they aren\u2019t missing. Sometimes all we can do is hold someone\u2019s hand. I\u2019ve sung to my patients, brushed their hair, prayed with them, and sat silently while holding their hand. It would have helped them to feel some peace in their last moments knowing they wouldn\u2019t die alone.\nI myself am not religious either, but I know that if I was scared and dying, hearing someone pray over me and saying the prayers that you mentioned would bring me comfort. You did the best things that you could have done. You called for help, and you stayed with them. They did not die alone because you were kind and compassionate enough to grant them your company. \nAs for the family, you should do what you feel is correct. It is never easy speaking to the family after someone has passed. I am a firm believer that it is not a weakness nor is it unprofessional to cry with the family. I often do. A life is a beautiful, complex, and fragile thing. It is a horrendous shame to lose one, and nothing that anyone could say will bring that family peace other than their own grieving process and time. \nWhat speaking to them will do is show them who their loved one spent their final breaths with. It will show them that their loved one was not alone. It is okay to cry in front of or with them. What you saw and experienced is traumatic. It\u2019s also okay to tell them you don\u2019t want to talk about the details of the accident and the persons injuries. If I were in your boots, I\u2019d want to meet with them to give them that small bit of comfort, and to help them to close the chapter on those last breaths. \n\nRegardless of what you choose to do, what you did do was very brave and very selfless.

You stayed there, tried to comfort and if that was all what could have been done, it was the absolute right thing to do. You were there and you will come to terms with the gruesome sight but gradually you\u2018ll realize that you showed the best i humanity and will bring you comfort over time.\n\nSeek help, talk to professionals. That\u2018s totally fine and it is not a sign of being weak.",
                ">They stopped questioning me because I had trouble hearing anyone speak to me for some reason.\n\nOP this could be disassociation - a sign of psychological shock. As another comment said please find a way to play Tetris.\n\nBut also find a way to make sure you have support. PTSD is no joke and it sometimes manifests in ways where the sufferer isn't aware of what is happening to them when they are triggered. Without support, sufferers are prone to further injuring themselves both physically and mentally, thus making a spiraling effect.\n\nIt may seem overwhelming now, but the sooner you get help the better off you're going to be.\n\nIf you feel up to it, I would consider talking with the family. Losing a loved one is hard enough, losing them to a violent death is even worse, losing them to a violent death when you couldn't be there for them is almost like a kind of death on its own. You have a chance to give them a lot of closure. Like othet comments said, you should neither tell them lies nor tell them anything that will not help them.\n\nYou can tell them you believe they were aware, but not in any pain. That you stayed with them through the end, prayed with them. Personally I would hold off on telling them they were trying to speak... you want to avoid information that opens up more room for ruminations.\n\nYou did a brave and good thing, but you're not through the woods. Take care of yourself and try to find peace.",

                "Don\u2019t talk to the family right now. They don\u2019t need to hear how awful it was and you aren\u2019t in a position to say that they weren\u2019t alone. Get some counseling and let yourself process it. What you did is a kind thing, but I can\u2019t imagine how hard it was. Sending a big hug.",
                "First of all: thank you. Thank you for staying. Thank you for caring. But also, thank.you for reaching out for help. \nOf course it is not your job to speak to the relatives.  So, you need to do two things:\n\n1) Seek help for your own trauma. Your great act of kindness should not become a life long trauma. Get help. Look for therapists or some kind of organisation that can help YOU. \n\n2) When you are at peace with your own emotions about what happened, AND ONLY THEN, you might consider talking to the family. You are under no obligation to talk to them if it is too hard. If you so want to talk to them, you ay wish to discuss this with a therapist first. Or have a professional present who can guide the conversation. \n\nBottom line: you have already done enough for the victim and their family. Do not feel you have to give more than you feel able to by meeting them. For some people,that helps, others find that traumatic. You need to work out which of those 2 options you prefer. \n\nExample: after my partner died of cancer, I started nursing school with the explicit goal to work in the hospice my partner died in. I ended up working with the nursing team that cared for my partner. 50% of my friends thought that was weird. The other 50% understood that this was the only way, for me, to deal with what happened. \n\nSo, find your own way. You are allowed to out yourself first here. Because when you stayed and held his hand, you out him first, when it mattered most.",

I think meeting with the family is great but if they ask what the last moments were like, it may be better to lie just a little to make it seem less painful and quicker. But that's just me. \n\nBut what I really wanted to let you know was to tell you how amazing of a person you are. To pray with someone as a source of comfort, though not religious yourself, but recognizing others in the area are. I'm an atheist myself but I still thought it was an incredibly awesome thing to do. Hopefully it helped. Bless you. I wish you the best.",

I was in a similar situation and provided CPR to a complete stranger--major difference was that his wife was there. He passed away at the scene while the ambulance tried to resuscitate him, but the family was really grateful they could speak with me.

You looked at the sky with them, and talked to them as they waited for EMTs.  \n\nNow do listen to all the advice here to care for yourself. \n\nTalk to the family if you feel ready. I am going to suggest you do not see them alone - meet them with their pastor or at the police station etc. The Sheriff knows them. I am saying don\u2019t see them alone because you did *everything you could* and yet they will still be grieving. One part of grief is anger and I want to be sure there is no way that turns on you. They will gain comfort in the long term by knowing their loved one was not alone, that you prayed and called for help and stayed. If anything is questioned, you say \u201c*I did everything I could.\u201d*",

That's a tough scene to come across and to be honest it sounds like you handled it extremely well.

                "You need to not go over this stuff right now especially in detail immediately after. Writing reports after an incident reinforces the event in great detail for people who do this as a job and by writing it out and reminisceing you are subconsciously reinforcing key episidodic memories into your mind and subconscious. Don't worry about what you will or won't say for now. You can figure that out later. Best thing I can say from multiple experiences is do the most normal stuff you can whilst also not putting any pressure on yourself. Talk if you have to but to the right people in the right time. Otherwise focus on activities you enjoy, maybe read or watch tv, get some sun, eat and drink well, etc. Keep your mind occupied. Take your time but try not to dwell in a dark place. If a time comes you want to talk to the family which you don't have to remember you are in control. Have compassion for yourself and don't be afraid to ask for help. Otherwise I would say don't stay on Reddit regarding this. Everything you read, check and answer is, like learning, reinforcing something through repition. You don't want to be unconciously doing that. Focus on good sleep the next few days also and again reach out if you need but otherwise remember you are in control of what you do from here and you don't need to stress about the family right now. End of the day if you do just think what you would want to know and use the empathy you clearly have and I am sure you will be fine.",
                "First and more importantly, as others said, take care of yourself, whatever that means for you. \n\nThat said, my sister passed away last year in a car accident. She was also still alive when the first person stopped. One of the hardest part about the whole thing is knowing she died without any of us by her side, without someone she loved holding her hand, but it does help to know someone was there and she wasn\u2019t completely alone. My family and I talked to the first person who arrived on the scene, he explained to us the chain of events, without going into details, and mostly made sure we knew she was never left alone from the moment he stopped to the moment she died. I am very graceful that he wanted to speak to us and we got to thank him. It\u2019s hard to not get to be with a loved one in their last moments and meeting that guy was mostly about meeting the person who was. it should have been us, he did our job of being with her and I\u2019m glad I got to thank him. It\u2019s a though situation all around, do what\u2019s best for you, just knowing you were there is helping them already.",

I met with their 2 children around a week later and they just wanted some of the obvious comforting answers, like they didnt seem in pain, they went as peacefully as possible, someone was holding their hand. They told me a little about their parent and were grateful to hear what i had to say, i felt it was the right choice to talk to them. If its too hard for you, thats a perfectly fine choice too",

                "I was a volunteer firefighter and EMT for a long time. In my experience friends and family like to know some things about their loved ones last moments. Nothing gory, more like \"there was nothing anyone could do\".\n\nGoing to a call is psychologically a lot different than coming across a tragedy unexpectedly. Also losing someone unexpectedly is harder than losing someone from their third heart attack.\n\nIt's really hard and can be haunting. Do reach out and let people help you. Just talking about what happened really helps. I think talking to the family would help all of you.",
                "It can be helpful to talk with first responders- and it can help them too. I\u2019ve been in EMS for 27 years. When we get done with a call like this we have the luxury of being able to talk with each other as a group - most often informally. Contrast that with your very personal experience and one can easily see how speaking with someone is so important. Speaking with someone capable of dealing with this sort of extreme experience is the way to go. As to speaking with the family I would just let them come to you if/when they\u2019re ready.   \ntip: You can ask EMS / Fire / Law to notate your name and on-scene presence in their reports. Families often request records after an event like this\u2026it\u2019s a way they can easily find out who was there\u2026possibly years after the incident. Law enforcement would likely be willing to advise the family of your involvement should they want / need to reach out to you. Hope this helps.",

Be totally truthful, don't tell someone what you think they \"want to hear\". For me, personally, knowing the details gives me closure. It might mot be that way for everyone, I don't know, but I would play it by ear with that family what they ask about/want to know.\n\nLastly, thank you so much for doing your absolute best. Do not doubt yourself, do not second-guess yourself. You did an amazing thing today. Thank you for being there for that person.",
                "I don't have experience being a family member of a person who passed in this manner, but I do have experience as an acquaintance. I knew a man who lived next door with his wife and three small children. Mom stayed at home with the kids all day and Dad worked, and every moment he wasn't at work he was with those kids. The family seemed very happy. One night, after work, he was driving home and suffered a stroke which caused his car accident. Two people came across the accident and stayed with him in his final moments and held his hand while they waited for emergency personnel, he was conscious and told them he was scared shortly before he passed. I know all this because the story made the news, and the girl who was with him told this to reporters. I remember reading it and being so glad someone was with him to hold his hand and tell him it would be okay, and then being absolutely devastated that he said he was scared. I cannot imagine how his wife felt hearing that and knowing he was terrified and likely knew he was dying. So while I can't give good advice on how to handle this, I can say that sometimes leaving out certain details is okay. Tell them you were with this person, and you talked to them, and let them know they weren't alone, that they did not appear to be in pain or scared. Not every detail is of value, and you can still tell them a very peaceful truth about their loved ones passing. I hope you are okay.",

If they reach out to you, I expect they would take great comfort in knowing you were there, reassuring them, and praying for them. If they don\u2019t reach out to you now, take some time to sit with it and see how you feel in the following weeks and months, and maybe make contact with them if you think it would help bring you closure, but you have absolutely no obligation to do so if it will upset you further.",

I had a concussion and a snapped femur, and apparently I had fistailed into a telephone pole and rolled. My first thought was how upset my parents would be at me.\n\nThose moments of lost memory haunt me. I was lucky, wearing my seat belt, going at a relatively low speed (40 mph). But I lost time, and there are times I wonder what would have happened if instead of waking up I died. Would that have been it? What about my family? My friends? \n\nAs someone who could have easily been the person you found, if you do speak to the family, let them know their loved one wasn't alone, that someone was there and prayed for them.

At the time he was in rigor mortis so it was 100% futile to be giving CPR, in fact we knew during it because the ribs cracked way too easily compared to a body that still had some elasticity. \n\nAnyway, the parents blamed the shit out of us. They said we didn\u2019t do enough even though we found him several hours post mortem. The parents tried to sue us, my landlord (this was near our house) almost evicted us because he thought we were doing drugs with this kid and then the family libeled us on social media and we had to fight them legally for defamation (and won) which crippled us financially. \n\nI dropped into the deepest depression I could imagine and my other friend moved away because he couldn\u2019t tolerate the negative attention anymore. Hell, sometimes I get so angry at the family that I think maybe I should libel or slander them back but then I remember looking at this kids face and I remember it\u2019s not worth it. \n\nI guess it just felt like my buddy and I tried to help and we even reached out to the family but all it did was make us poorer and mentally distraught. I still cry over this and it was just last week where I had a mental breakdown over it. I blame the mental breakdowns mostly on the fact that all of the legal shit never let me catch my breath and reach out for help. \n\nSo my one tip to you is to take care of yourself. The family will grieve and maybe one day they will want to ask questions that you may have answers for but for the time being, please reach out for help even if you feel fine. In fact, if you feel fine now then this is the best time to get help.  \n\nGood luck",

                "Listen I don\u2019t know if it will make you feel any better but from your limited description they were gone by the time you got there the breaths you were hearing are what\u2019s know as Agonal breaths and the eyes darting is all limited CNS responses it\u2019s great that you were there in the slim chance they were still of this earth but rest easy knowing you couldn\u2019t have changed the outcome it was out of your hands the biggest issue I\u2019ve seen amongst survivors and first responders is the dread and overwhelming feeling that they could have changed something it\u2019s been my experience that knowing you couldn\u2019t have really helps",
                "I\u2019m so sorry you had to go through this. While extremely difficult, and I can\u2019t imagine going through it, you did a great thing and the family can take solace in the fact they weren\u2019t alone. Take care of yourself and don\u2019t hesitate to call those numbers and speak to somebody.",
                "I\u2019ve been on both sides. I saw a horrific accident and I did reach out to the family afterwords. I was able to answer many of the questions they had around what happened. They were so grateful to get answers about what happened and know she wasn\u2019t alone. I also had an uncle pass away unexpectedly in a very public place that left me and my family with a lot of questions about how it could have happened and what happened. Hearing what happened from people that were there helped with healing in getting some answers. Dealing with his loss was and continues to be hard but having those that were there be willing to talk to us was invaluable. My recommendation is to reach out when you are ready. You witnessed something traumatic and most likely have some processing and healing of your own to do.",
                "Take care of yourself first and foremost. If you need to go to therapy and put this event behind you, then that is completely fair. \nBut if you are able to talk to the family it may give them some peace and closure knowing that you were there with them and potentially brought them comfort in their final moments. \nI know a family who experienced something similar and they were very glad to talk to the people that stayed with their son in his final moments. It helped them process and come to terms with what happened.",
                "My dad died in my arms at 14 from a completely fatal heart attack.. I didn't see gore, but I saw his eyes staring into mine as he was dying. I didn't even realize it was a heart attack. I was the only one doing anything and the person on the phone. Every second felt like a whole entire hour. I know what you mean. The takeaway I got from that was I was \\*there\\* though. At least I was there. And he was not alone.   \nI took this with me for every pet I lost. That's something you can take comfort in. You were there, and it was so hard to see, but you were there, so it was less hard for them.   \nI hope you are okay. I know you are going through it, but I know if you want to be, you'll be okay. I believe in you. And I am so thankful you were there for that person.",
                "My sister passed away in a car accident. I will never forget the firefighter who told me he stayed with her until her last breath. We asked him to lead the funeral procession so we could all leave flowers in her final place.",
                "Why the hell would this person's family be given contact to you, wtf?! I wouldn't talk with the family at all and would sue the PD if they gave em my contact. I used to work in a law firm that was helping people get the insurance money after their close one died in a car accident. From the liability insurance of the one who caused the accident. Most Insurance Companies don't want to pay punitive damages/satisfaction, after the death of the loved one (the court rulings are clear, 99% cases won, but the law leaves room to interpretation for the law firms) or they pay like 1/4 of what they should so we make those companies pay in full. I heard thousands of stories. There were also stories where THEIR family member was the one who caused the accident. It was clear as the day, from the documents of the case, from the clients own mouth but they still blamed an innocent driver and would just love to ruin their lives. There were also stories of people like you, who didn't even saw the accident, much less participated in it. And they still blamed that person, saying that person must have something to do with the accident yada yada, equally as eager to ruin that person any way they can. Thankfully, they didn't got any info on the person from the police as it would be literally illegal. Beware, you already did the good thing, if I were you I would participate in nothing more, unless they would actually contact me, then I would have to think whether i want to be dragged in their grieving process depending on what they would tell me.",

                "You might want to edit this, and delete the Geo Tracker info.. I doubt there's a surplus of those still around - so it wouldn't be real hard for the victims family to put 2 and 2 together.   \nYou answer their questions honestly, but tactfully and chose your words carefully. Don't offer more detail then they need to know so they can have closure and know their loved one wasn't totally alone b4 they died.  You give them a real but benign version, tight rope walking like you are doing a dui walking the line test. You hug that benign line for dear life, and spare them the gore.     \nI'm sorry you had this experience. I watched a motorcyclist die on the 4th of July one year. We were right over the state border lines, and I always regretted not driving back over to the other side and calling 911 from the other state. Like I know that's wrong to call 911 and tell them it's in there state when it's 200 feet into the other state - but I still think the response time would've been better given the remoteness of the location.  I wasn't out of my vehicle with the victim I was a few cars behind so I had a front row view of everything but there were already people attempting to attend to him.   I'm not even sure first responders from another state would've crossed the state line, but I feel like I should've tried anyways. I still feel bad when I think about it. but eventually I stopped thinking about it all the time. if it doesn't stop running through your head constantly soon - don't wait talk to someone. It's not a sign of weakness if you need to talk it out with someone - it show's strength to own it's bugging you and openly deal with it instead of just letting it eat you alive.",

You were with them at the end, they knew somebody was with them, if the family is at all religious mention the prayers, and say they didn\u2019t seem to be in pain.\n\nThis might even be the truth if they were in shock. That they didn\u2019t die alone will be a comfort to the family and the prayers may be as well.",
                "What you did was so wonderful. I would wait to see if they contact you and if they do, I would just tell what happened. That you stayed with them and tried to bring them some level of comfort. I don\u2019t think you need to tell them anymore than that. If they ask for details, I think you can just say you were focused on their loved one.",

As a professional in this area who has seen my fair share of horrible accident scenes where death was inherently imminent I'm somewhat desensitized to it at this point. In saying that for a regular person such as yourself to witness this it can be extremely hard to process. It can certainly keep replaying in your mind often seeing it in your head when your eyes are closed but take solace knowing you comforted this individual and ultimately did the right thing by praying for them. I myself have had many victims family members ask me what their loved ones last words were. It  will most certainly bring them comfort that you stopped you stayed and that you prayed for them in their last moments of life!!! Stay strong and don't suppress this talk about it",

Normally you just look sideway a few times so your brain registers what is there 1st your shock is more manageable this way.

                "Thank you for what you did. You're the ultimate Good Samaritan. Along with everyone else, if the family wants to talk all you need to say is that they were not alone.

                "Tell the family that they passed away instantly from their injuries and they didn't suffer. It is a lie but you will be saving them a lot of heartache, I wouldn't recount in any detail what you saw to the family, I'd save that for the counsellor or psych if you decide to see one.",
                "Thank you for just being there. Speaking calmly, reassuring a fellow human during their passing. You did an act of kindness, of humanity. You cannot screw anything up if they want to talk to you. They probably just want to thank you. I would. I\u2019d hug you and thank you.",

During his escape, he drove a car directly up to the Military Demarcation Line (MDL) dividing North and South Korea and crashed, apparently losing a wheel. He then exited the car and sprinted across the MDL under close-range gunfire, collapsing on the South Korean side under cover of a low wall, meters away from the MDL. After being rescued by South Korean soldiers, Oh was transported in a helicopter from the U.S. Eighth Army's 2nd Combat Aviation Brigade, to the Ajou University Hospital in Suwon. Having lost half of his blood from five gunshot wounds received from North Korean soldiers during his escape, his condition required an immediate surgery operation upon arrival at the hospital to save his life.\n\n* Excerpted from [Oh Chong-song](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oh_Chong-song) at the English Wikipedia",

            "selftext": "My (25M) little sister (F18), lets call her Christy, has recently gotten her license. She obviously thinks she\u2019s an incredible driver and can handle a car no matter what.\n\nAfter only 4 months of driving she has already become one of those girls who put their phone between their thighs to be able to look at messages and access it quickly while driving. It drives us all insane tbh and I and other family members have talked to her about it multiple times. It goes in one ear and out the other.\n\nYesterday she did it again while driving my car when we were out getting groceries. She had been distracted for almost the whole drive and even continued to look at her phone (after a brief break) when I told her to cut it. \n\nWhen she was about to roll into a parking spot she probably got a message and looked down at her phone. I noticed that she was about to ram into a lantern and when I was sure she wouldn\u2019t cause damage to other vehicles I decided to just let her run into it instead of intervening. \n\nIt was a huge shock to her and she just sat there for completely still for like 15 seconds processing what just happened. It wasn\u2019t until I said \u201cwill you learn to leave that fucking phone alone now?\u201d that she spoke again.\n\nThe first thing she said was \u201cwhy didn\u2019t you tell me!?\u201d in an absolutely baffled tone and I told her straight up that I didn\u2019t tell her so she\u2019d learn a lesson. She was absolutely livid and tried to push all blame onto me for not intervening, but I told her it would have been the same outcome had I not been there and that ultimately she, as a driver, is responsible for not only her but also all passengers safety.\n\nChristy was absolutely gobsmacked that she fucked around and found out, even more so when I told her she would have to account for half the damages caused in the accident that the insurance wouldn\u2019t cover. In total that was just shy of 200 bucks (blown out light, bent bumper and a dent in the hood + a few scraces and the damage to the pole of the lantern).\n\nShe went completely wild, but I told her that she\u2019s lucky I\u2019m not making her pay for everything since SHE WAS DRIVING WHILE BEING ON THE PHONE. \n\nA few days after the insurance gave me the sum and I told Christy what she owes me, which she paid immediately, she told me that apparently because of this she won\u2019t be able to go on a trip with her friends and that I\u2019m a massive asshole. She also added she would have learned her lesson otherwise too.\n\nI personally doubt that she would have and honestly distracted drivers are the worst.\n\nAITA?",

She seems very shaken (rightfully so) and good that she paid back immediately and is feeling the financial CONSEQUENCE which is $$$$lost so no trip for her (thats what you get!).

The shock and fright, coupled with the very real consequence of being responsible for damages, should resonate with her for a while. I hope she will also reflect on what else might\u2019ve happened\u2014such as if that lantern had been a pedestrian.

She obviously thinks she\u2019s an incredible driver and can handle a car no matter what.\n\nAfter only 4 months of driving she has already become one of those girls who put their phone between their thighs to be able to look at messages and access it quickly while driving. It drives us all insane tbh and I and other family members have talked to her about it multiple times. It goes in one ear and out the other.\n\nYesterday she did it again while driving my car when we were out getting groceries. She had been distracted for almost the whole drive and even continued to look at her phone (after a brief break) when I told her to cut it. \n\nWhen she was about to roll into a parking spot she probably got a message and looked down at her phone. I noticed that she was about to ram into a lantern and when I was sure she wouldn\u2019t cause damage to other vehicles I decided to just let her run into it instead of intervening. \n\nIt was a huge shock to her and she just sat there for completely still for like 15 seconds processing what just happened. It wasn\u2019t until I said \u201cwill you learn to leave that fucking phone alone now?\u201d that she spoke again.\n\nThe first thing she said was \u201cwhy didn\u2019t you tell me!?\u201d in an absolutely baffled tone and I told her straight up that I didn\u2019t tell her so she\u2019d learn a lesson. She was absolutely livid and tried to push all blame onto me for not intervening, but I told her it would have been the same outcome had I not been there and that ultimately she, as a driver, is responsible for not only her but also all passengers safety.\n\nChristy was absolutely gobsmacked that she fucked around and found out, even more so when I told her she would have to account for half the damages caused in the accident that the insurance wouldn\u2019t cover. In total that was just shy of 200 bucks (blown out light, bent bumper and a dent in the hood + a few scraces and the damage to the pole of the lantern).\n\nShe went completely wild, but I told her that she\u2019s lucky I\u2019m not making her pay for everything since SHE WAS DRIVING WHILE BEING ON THE PHONE. \n\nA few days after the insurance gave me the sum and I told Christy what she owes me, which she paid immediately, she told me that apparently because of this she won\u2019t be able to go on a trip with her friends and that I\u2019m a massive asshole. She also added she would have learned her lesson otherwise too.\n\nI personally doubt that she would have and honestly distracted drivers are the worst.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

                "NTA\n\nIf everyone is worried about her driving while distracted, why is she still being given access to cars?",
                "NTA. People like your sister are a damned menace. Eyes on the road at all time because you never know when some jackass will come barreling through a red light and you need to make a split second reaction to keep people from getting killed. It was better she learned it from something low stakes than being said jackass that runs a red light and T-bones someone, causing serious damage at best, and a fatality or two at worst.",
                "It was a cheap lesson! NTA\n\nLike you said, she fucked around and found out!",
                "If you know she's a dangerous and poor driver...why are you letting her drive your car at all?",
                ">She also added she would have learned her lesson otherwise too.\n\nPossibly by dying and maybe taking a family of 4 with her. NTA\n\nI'd fucking report her to the police, and try to have her licence revoked. But that probably still wouldn't be as good a lesson as this was. I'm just worried it won't be enough. Texting while driving is insane. If I was dictator I'd have the cars impounded and auctioned off  and the licence revoked for 6 months first offence, 3 years second offence, 10 year third offence, and for life on the fourth.",
                "My dad died two weeks ago after being hit by a car while biking. The police report stated the driver \"just didn't see him\". \n\nNTA. Driving distracted is a huge, horrible risk. If she can't be off her phone long enough to make a quick trip (or even just finish pulling into a parking space) then she needs to stop driving or start putting the phone away. \n\nMine sits in my lap so I can hear it and check when I am pulled over/stopped, and we connect to the car stereo for Bluetooth so changing music doesn't mean doing anything more than tapping a button.",
                "send her a picture of the lantern with a screaming human face on it... tell her put that as her phone's locked screen. So they next time she's tempted, she will remember that she can easily kill someone with her stupidity.",

You know she's driving recklessly and are enabling her dangerous behavior!  Stop it, NOW!!  Next time she could kill someone or herself!   What if she knocked the light down and it hit another car or person!  Also, you should have made her pay 100% instead of going through insurance b/c  your rates are going to go up b/c of the claim.  You should make her pay the difference!",

                "Your sister was lucky it wasn\u2019t worse. My son passed his driving test at 17 (we\u2019re UK) and I have absolutely drummed into his head - cars are lethal. \n\nThe difference is, he saved & bought his own car, yes he has insurance and dash cam. And he treats his car and other drivers with respect. \n\nYou and your family are lucky not worse - as you said, you\u2019ve all noticed her terrible driving. You\u2019re all responsible for letting it go. You\u2019ve let her drive knowing she does this!!! So you are all AH.\n\nBecause knowing she drives like this, you\u2019re aware she puts others at risk. \n\nI detest people like you and your sister - and you still let her drive your car. So yes you\u2019re equally responsible knowing about her. It won\u2019t be long before she kills someone but you and your family have enabled that.",
                "NTA, but I don't think I would have told her that you saw the accident coming. Honestly, I don't even understand why you let her drive your car to begin with, knowing her complete and utter disrespect for the safety of others. Please, for the love of God, keep scolding her for using her phone while driving. At this rate, it won't be long until she has killed someone.",
                "NTA. As you pointed out, she's been f**King around for months and she's finally reached the moment of finding out. Not your fault she's missing a trip, that's entirely on her. Well played.",

Keep doing it long enough and you will kill someone. \n\nA distracted driver rear ended me at a stop sign. Low speed, both humans were fine. \n\nHe managed to hit a crumple zone on my car, however. He/his insurance wound up paying $8,000 in damages, $5,000 depreciated value claim, and $7,000 rental car fees. And that was before the inflation of the past few years. \n\nA light pole and $200 is a cheap lesson in the world of hitting things with a car.",

                "Hard fucking disagreeing with everyone. \n\nYOU LET SOMEONE TEXT AND FUCKING DRIVE. \n\nIt was ONLY AFTER you were at the end of the recent drive that you did anything, which was to let her crash. \n\nBut before that? Were there literally no cars on the road? No pedestrians? You live literally where no one lives? \n\nWhat you should have done is either demand that she hand over her phone or pull over so you can drive. \n\nEveryone thanking that it was in the parking lot, completely ignoring how people actually get to parking lots. Everyone ignoring this isn\u2019t the first time and how the family still lets her drive. That the OP still lets her drive their car. \n\nESH. \n\nThe sister, the family, the OP, everyone here. \n\nYou are super fucking lucky it happened the way it was. But it doesn\u2019t fucking excuse however long it was she was driving distracted before that moment.",

                "Nta. She needs to grow up and start realising she is in control of a machine that could KILL someone. If she can't go on a trip because of her own actions, that's the consequences. She should be grateful it was only a lantern and you were in the car at the time.",
                "NTA but I don\u2019t know why any of you were letting her drive your cars. You know she is unsafe and could easily have killed somebody",
                "As someone who has been disabled by a drunk driver, NTA.  Not that distracted is the same as drunk, but she hit a lantern.  It could've been a person or a car or a kid darting out in front of her in a parking lot.  She needs to learn now to pay attention, and since that damaged nothing but her ego and you car that was a safe way to do it.",

You chose to accept an accident on your insurance policy to prove a point and hopefully make her a safer driver. You\u2019re a damn good big brother. \n\nThe fact is, if she\u2019s doing that and driving alone, she could get into a serious accident. She could total a vehicle. She could kill someone.

My friends house was Coming up behind this Big Bush, and a car on the side of the sidewalk. I know she has 4 kids, 2 being under 5, and very small. I wasn\u2019t driving fast or anything, actually about 10 under the limit. Then, out of *no where* a little cat is in front of me, from under the parked car, and I STAND on my brake, and barely miss the cat, while my friends youngest kid, 2yo, runs into the side of the car. This happend, driving Only 20-25km/h in a 5meter area. Nothing happend to anyone, other than my heart jumping to my throat and the incredible shaking of my hands after. \n\nWhen you\u2019re driving, then drive. It\u2019s not just you, and your car you\u2019re risking. Its other peoples property, animals and *people*. And it Only takes a fucking second, even when you\u2019re alert. \n\nGood job on teaching your sister a lesson. Had she been driving my car that day, and it happend? She could have killed a cat and a 2yo. Is she willing to risk that?",
                "NTA. If she wanted to use her phone in the car, why didn\u2019t she just ask you to drive instead?? Her actions are going to kill someone if she doesn\u2019t stop doing this.",

Kudos to you for your awareness that nobody her stupid ego was going to get hurt and this was the only way to learn. I sure hope that she does learn too. 'Oh i cant go away with my friends' tough luck kiddo this is the concequencies of your actions!!!! \n\nNTA and i hope this is the last time she has to learn the hard way",
                "NTA\n\nThis is some next level lesson real life teaching.\n\nI mean, you literally let your car be damaged in order to potentially save her life one day, and probably someone else\u2019s.",
                "I would rip her driving licence into pieces and throw her phone away! She's gonna kill someone or herself. You should really make big deal out of it before it's too late.",
                "I applaud you, this was by far the best lesson you could have given her. NTA.",
                "NTA.\n\nShe says she would have learned that lesson anyway? Ask her to think where and how she spends the largest majority of her time driving, then ask her to think if she would have preferred to learn said lesson crawling at 2mph rolling into a parking space, or at 70+ on a highway somewhere as she drifts out of her lane.",

I told her then work at McDonalds, not use her body.\n\nWe got into an argument, and i asked her to quit stripping and get a decent job then.

She got upset and said that wasn\u2019t fair, and that she doesn\u2019t make enough for that. I told her to figure it out.\n\nShe told my wife about what happened, and my wife is upset by her job of choice but says it\u2019s unfair for me to stop supporting her so suddenly over an argument.

            "selftext": "**I am NOT the Original Poster. That is** u/Polaritium. He posted in r/TrueOffMyChest.\n\n**Original** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/13hjm1q/my_girlfriend_sold_my_car_because_of_a_petty/)**: May 14, 2023**\n\nSo, for a bit of context: My girlfriend and i have known eachother for around 4 years, but started dating during 2021. That car has been passed down for GENERATIONS by the way (Its a 1972 Ford F100) my grandpa owned, then passed down to my dad, then passed down to me. I dont drive it too often, as i do have my own car, but i use it for work.\n\nRecently, we've gotten into an argument over me not taking care of our two cats. Thing is, i spend almost all day working, and the rest of it resting. So, what did she do? She got the pickup truck, went to a junkyard, and sold it! Worst part? She sold it for 400 dollars. Keep in mind, this truck was in PRISTINE condition.\n\nWhen i got back home from the bar, i noticed the pickup wasnt there. I asked her, and she told me what she did. I instantly packed up my things, my cat, told her we were done and left. I've been getting calls from her, her family and friends everyday calling me names. Am i in the wrong?\n\n***Relevant Comments:***\n\n*The argument:*\n\n\"First time we had an argument over chores. Last argument we had was about her disappearing on me for 9 hours without any previous notice, that was about a month ago.\"\n\n\"Thing is, it's not like i just DIDNT take care of the cats at all. I just was really busy with work and got back home really tired. Also, keep in mind that i was the bread winner in the house.\"\n\n\"I had an agreement that she WOULD do the chores, i put food on the table. I still loved the cats, and fed them.\"\n\n**Update (Same Post): May 15 (Next Day)** *(date recovered with Web Archive)*\n\nUpdate 1: Thanks for all the advice and support! Two things: I have talked to my lawyer cousin. He said i could have a solid case if this goes to court, but honestly, after all the shit i've been through i want my pickup back and some more for what happened. I doubt the police is going to do anything after a couple of bad experiences i've had with them. My ex came knocking on my door, i ignored her, dont want anything to do with that bitch anymore. My dad also got the news and was super sad, considering that truck was pretty much the family's breadwinner for about 30 years.\n\n**Update 2 (Same Post): Between May 15-16**\n\nThanks for the advice again! I have now filed a police report for the stolen F100. I have hope it can be done! I am also doing my own bit of research, driving to a couple nearby junkyards, but i doubt i'll find it on my own. I hope we can find the Old Green F100 we love so much.\n\n**Update 3 (Same Post): May 15-16, 2023**\n\nThe F100 has been found on a nearby junkyard by a friend! Thanks for all the support guys.\n\n**Update 4 (Same Post): May 15-16, 2023**\n\nSo, people have been asking these things, so i feel like i should clarify.\n\n1 - Its not like i took no care of the cats at all, i did. She doesn't work. I put the bread in the table, she gets the house chores done. Thats how we managed it, which is why i feel like this was petty.\n\n2 - I went to a bar to hang out with a friend i had not seen in 5 years. I dont drink heavily or often.\n\n3 - The signature was forged by my girlfriend, from what i know at the moment, or the junkyard guy just took it because it was a 9.6k profit. The junkyard opens at 12:30am today, and since its currently 5:00am here, i'm still gonna have to wait for a while, as you might be able to tell, today was quite a crazy day. Haven't gotten one minute of sleep.\n\n**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/user/Polaritium/comments/13ip8vi/finally_have_the_truck_back/)**: May 15, 2023**\n\nSo, i have the F100 back. Over a day of no-sleep, work and panic.. and its finally over. She's been charged with a Class 1 Felony for stealing a car worth more than $10,000. She's been fined $5,000. Finally back from the garage with the truck... I'm so tired. I'll take a nap now. I'll update you guys more throughly tomorrow. I dont feel like explaining every detail right now.. Its 19:09pm and i'm really tired of this fucking shit.Edit: Also, feel free to AMA.. I'll try to answer everything.\n\n**Update 5 (Same as OG Post): May 16, 2023 (2 days from OG Post)**\n\nI have the truck back! The F100 is actually back, i did have to pay the $400 back though, and its not as good as it was before.. Its really dirty (probably from driving to the junkyard, which is pretty dirty) and the bodywork that was once pristine is now damaged.. Has a huge scratch on the paint. It was a really sharp key or something, because the bodywork is now ruined. It has started flash rusting, which is really not good. The paint is ruined. The truck itself isnt as great as before, i can tell she broke the brake fluid line as well, because the brakes are running badly. Good news though, my girlfriend has been charged with a C1F for GTA and fined $5,000. Don't worry though, i will still follow through with the lawsuit.\n\n**Newsweek Article written about this** [here](https://www.newsweek.com/man-suing-girlfriend-over-family-heirloom-1800636?amp=1). **OOP's name is John.**",

In these situations they were separate friends but both in my car and I felt bad for not being able to help. I am at the local Walmart now and wondering if it would be weird for me to buy tampons to keep in my car just as an emergency thing for other people. \n\nMy immediate thought was no that would be weird, then I began to reason that it would probably be much more helpful than weird and I\u2019m always looking to be of help to anyone especially my friends. NOW however I\u2019m having doubts when it comes to how it could be weird even in the situation, offering: \u201cI have a tampon.\u201d And if someone were to see them in my glove compartment or wherever I would have to explain the whole dilemma. Let me know I\u2019d love to hear your opinions. \n\nA few specific questions I have for the women: Would you be weirded out if you asked the women around you for a tampon and a guy offered one? Would it be weird to open a male friends glove compartment and see tampons? Is it worth the questioning and explaining to have a tampon? What do I tell my mom? \n\nAll comments help thanks!",

But he was offended that I do not consider it belonging to the both of us. We pretty much split everything 50/50 because he gets weird about money. We have separate accounts and it has worked really well for us so far. I know more traditional marriages share everything with their partner. But as I said, he gets really possessive of his money, so I always felt it best to keep money separate so we can avoid conflict. I guess he feels entitled to the new car since we are married. But I feel like if he didn't love the car, he wouldn't care to ever claim ownership. So AITA for saying it is strictly MY car not OUR car?",

            "selftext": "Hi everyone, I'm in a bit of a difficult situation and need some unbiased opinions.\n\nOver the last couple of years, I have lost nearly 80lbs through extreme dedication to dieting and exercise. With It's been a life-changing journey for me. The journey started when my doctors warned me about my poor cardiovascular health because of my unhealthy eating habits and lifestyle. With 30 right around the corner I couldn't keep being the man I was before. It was a significant wake-up call. I tried immediately just focusing on going hard in the gym, but I tried lifting weights without eating properly and pretty much fried my CNS during deadlifts, causing me to pass out at the gym. It scared the hell out of me.\n\nSince then, I've taken my health incredibly seriously. I prep all my meals and they are calculated to meet my nutritional needs for the day and keep a caloric deficit to have me on track for losing weight. I've avoided eating out at all costs, as it feels like a slippery slope back to my old habits. For me, restaurants are like relapsing on a drug. One bite of a cheesesteak eggroll and I'm buying oreos on the way home and falling off the wagon.\n\nMy girlfriend has been supportive of my health journey but hasn't joined me. She still cooks and eats as she did before, which is a lot of food covered in fats and sugars with a lot of calories. I'm appreciative of her cooking but I can't eat the meals she makes most of the time. It's been a bit of a strain on our relationship, but we've managed.\n\nSo, boom. The conflict arose on our anniversary last month. She wanted to go out to a fancy restaurant to celebrate. And, I wanted to make the night special as well, and I agreed to go. I even made sure I had calories leftover to have drinks with dinner. However, I didn't want to break my diet and decided to bring a prepped meal to eat in the car before we went in.\n\nShe discovered what I was doing and got really upset. She called me an asshole for not putting aside my diet for one night, saying I cared more about my food intake than about our special day. She said that I was being selfish and that I should have been more considerate of her feelings since it's our anniversary.\n\nI feel conflicted. On one hand, I understand where she's coming from, and I didn't mean to upset her. On the other hand, I've worked really hard to improve my health and I'm scared of falling back into old habits.\n\nAITA for sticking to my diet even on our anniversary?\n\nEdit: I'm 5'4\" and 297 pounds currently.",

It's a phenomenal and fascinating read, and you can see the genesis of most of his later work in it. It is not a flattering portrait \u2014 like _The Wire_, it is about sometimes-good, sometimes-not cops trying to do what would already be a hard job in a very dysfunctional system and in a dysfunctional society. One doesn't come away thinking that things are going great. \n\nSo why'd the Baltimore Chief of Police approve Simon's request to be embedded? Simon just wrote him a letter and asked \u2014 he had no sway with him, he was just some random young reporter at the time. Why on earth would you let someone like that into your organization for an entire year, to create something that you know would be displayed, warts and all, to the world? It's an objectively terrible idea from the perspective of someone in power. Why do it?\n\nSimon himself didn't know, but was happy to take the opportunity. But he in a postscript to the book, he explains that he later found out that the Chief had learned he had terminal brain cancer, and so was essentially \"off the hook\" for any negative consequences, and thought that this kind of thing would show the world exactly what needed to be changed, and so be a net positive thing. And in doing so he transmuted his own personal illness and misery into something wonderful, maybe even something that can improve things, someday.\n\n(Anyway I acknowledge that in some respects this is a little different from the original post...)",

Based on the black and white strip count painted on bridge side wall, the distance is approximately 20 meters.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s convert 20 meters to kilometers: 1 kilometer = 1000 meters So, 20 meters = 20 / 1000 = 0.02 kilometers\n\nNext, we need to convert the time to hours. Since the car is driving for 1 second, we don\u2019t need to make any conversions for time.\n\nNow, we can calculate the speed in kilometers per hour: Speed (km/h) = Distance (km) / Time (h) = 0.02 km / 0.000277778 h \u2248 72 km/h\n\nTherefore, the speed of the car would be approximately 72 kilometers per hour.

I was cycling northbound on Kilburn High Road, the driver tried to turn across me into Brondesbury Road.\n\n\u201cHe did managed to stop without hitting me, but I stopped to tell him he needed to be more careful, he immediately moved forward fairly slowly, pushing me and the bike a metre or less, I said now I needed his insurance details as he may have damaged my front wheel.\n\n\u201cHe exited the vehicle and shoved me to the ground, that\u2019s why in the videos my bike is no longer facing north.\n\n\u201cThen the part on the videos happened, plus a further attempt to leave with the bike stuck under his car, and some of the crowd encouraging the driver to \u2018get away before the feds [police] come\u2019, it was them that actually pulled the bike out from the car as an attempt to assist his escape.\u201d",

Pretty minor, but the owner had just walked out their front door and saw me hit her car. She was more concerned about me than her car.\n I've also hit the back of a parked truck when I was about 7 lol. Racing my friends down the street I was looking behind me to see where they were.

I pulled over to the shoulder in the far right and I see the guy just sitting in his car on his phone\u2026 completely blocking the carpool lane and nose was into the wall so his drivers door was facing oncoming traffic. \n\nI ran across all 6 lanes to get to the middle, figuring any second someone was gonna slam into him at full speed right into his driver door, I stood on the center divide so I could jump down either side just in case, it was an older guy like late 60s maybe he was in shock or just really slow but he rolled down his window and said good evening like nothing was even wrong lol.\n\nI told him put on your hazards and GTFO and join me on the center. He groaned like I was being annoying\u2026. I SCREAMED at him and he relented slowly grabbing his stupid shit and getting out.\n\nAfter I helped him out (his door was a little jammed) I decided best bet was to frogger our way across the freeway and sit safely in my truck.\n\nFirst off all freeways are WAY wider than you think, and cars come up on you WAY faster than you think. I waited for a break in traffic\u2026 closest car was 200 yards away, figured we had an eternity to cross. I dragged him as fast as I could and we BARELY made it before cars started zipping by again\u2026 whew close call.\n\nWithin a minute of getting to my truck I see a BMW flying down the carpool lane, as it closes in I notice the map lights are on.., great driver isn\u2019t paying attention at all. \n\nThis lady in an X5 ended up T boning his car at 80mph+, didn\u2019t even touch the brakes. She had to be taken away in an ambulance\u2026 he would\u2019ve been 100% dead had he still been in the car.\n\nAsshole never even said thank you, just groaned more about his stupid car. I was fucking furious and yeah don\u2019t ever try to cross the freeway like I did. I got lucky and it ended up being the right call. But could\u2019ve just as easily been road kill attempting it.

I pull in and dude just keeps waving me to move around him to go past him, and im like naw bro I haven't driven in 7 years. I am not gonna hit a fuckin pedestrian because you want me to go, its a fuckin mall not a nascar race.

So I literally cut my lil bugger 5 minutes maybe 10 till I gotta clock in whip that lil engine to the right go straight down to the back of the lot and this hoe. I tell you, shes all driving n shit and im about to stop but then she hestitates and stops, I guess I was going to fast. I Hesitate middle of my stop because my cars breaks are so god damn sensative.

So I turn right and park, by this time other people have noticed. \n\nAbout the time I get to the guys car his foot slips of the brake and the truck barrels into cars across the street does doughnuts before finally hitting a pole and stopping. He was in diabetic shock. \n\nSometimes people that run people over don\u2019t mean to, they should be driving.",

Every time we would open the doors to clean up, roaches would scurry in and out of the seats and the dashboard vents. After we cleaned up a bit, His dad bought a huge (like 60\u2019 x 60\u2019) tarp and drove the car over it, then folded the other half over it, essentially making a car burrito out of it. He then placed cinder blocks over one side of the folds and then began the fumigation cycle. \n\nWe bought like 4 packs of those roach foggers and he placed them inside the car, beneath the hood, in the trunk, etc. Then each one of us had to activate like three or four foggers and haul ass out from under the tarp. He then placed another row of cinder blocks along the open side. We waited as the foul mist began to leak from the edges of the tarp. Then we saw hundreds of the brown little fuckers trying to get out from the tarp. We were ready and started stomping them whenever they escape out from their gas chamber.\n\nSo the car sat engulfed in fog like this for the rest of the day. The next morning, we removed the tarp and found like 10 dead mice along with thousands  of roaches. His dad started unbolting the seats and tossing them on the grass. We swept up the dead bodies and started removing the dash board and carpeting. There we roach droppings by the thousands inside the dash and under the rug. We basically tore the entire car apart even removing the B pillar trim and cloroxed that shit like it was a hospital room. In the end it took about 3 days of work and the car was driveable again. \n\nThen 1 year later my idiot friend totaled it when he spun out on the highway into a ditch because his tires were bald as hell.",

But natural gas really doesn't like to be compressed into a liquid, the fuel tank has to be extremely strong or this happens, the pressure is up to 3500 PSI.  For those who aren't used to our whimsical measurement system, that's pounds per square inch, it means that every postage stamp size segment of the tank is under pressure equivalent to the weight of the car.  Sometimes they explode this violently and the gas doesn't even ignite, just pressure like a big steel balloon popping.\n\nThe whole idea of hydrogen cars is based on the idea of confining  a gas with an even higher vapor pressure, which also chemically attacks most alloys of steel.",
