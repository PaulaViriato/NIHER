            "selftext": "I'm 22M and my Dad remarried about 5 years ago, I lived with him until shortly before hand then I moved in with my Mom.\n\nMy Dad's wife has a son that is 38, and he needed a place to stay last year and he declined because he didn't want someone that old living with them.  I have had an apartment the last 3 years with roommates.  I was going to the local college but stopped about Dec 2021. So I been working a couple jobs. I have a car and two roommates we shared a 2 bedroom apartment. They both decided to move in with their GFs. So I need a place to stay. Plus I can't afford an apartment plus tuition.\n\nWell, I want to get back in school and save up money for a new place.\n\nI asked my Dad if I can move in with him. He got back to me last week and said I can move in Labor Day Weekend.  He provided me the following rules:\n\n* I can't have girls in the house, pull up in the driveway, cul-de-sac\n* No guy friends in the house after 8PM or before 10AM (unless driving me to work or class)\n* I can't drink or use marijuana (its legal in our state)\n* He can drug/alcohol test me anytime he chooses.\n* I have to cut the grass, shovel the snow, and complete a weekly grocery store run for his wife.\n* I must attend class everyday I am scheduled\n* I have to keep my own car and I can't borrow his or his wife's.\n* I have a midnight curfew, exception is if I get off work after 11PM, then I have 2 hours to get home. Missing curfew means I can't come home for the evening. Being gone 3 straight days means I have moved out.\n* I have to attend church with him twice a month\n* If his wife ask me to do something I need to do it. If she ask me to do something and it makes me uncomfortable call him, and he will handle it\n\nIn return he said he will do the following:\n\n* Pay for two courses this semester, if I get a B or better he will pay for two more courses next semester.\n* He will provided me an employee referral at his job so I can get a better position for a second job. The security guards make $22/hr but its overnight shift. Its not guaranteed placement, but several people's kids work overnight as security guards, on cleaning crews.\n* 6 months of rent-free living. If I move out by January 1, 2024 he will give me $5K towards a new place.\n\nI think my dad should either help or just say no.  These rules are absurd. I am an adult. I have two jobs and pay for my own car/insurance.  I can legally drink or smoke weed.  He said I can have guy friends over, but not woman.  I have a couple of good friends that are women, and its weird inviting over some of my guy buddies but not them. His request are completely controlling. I think he made these rules so I would say no, and if I said yes, if I break the rules he can kick me out anyway.  \n\n\nShould I request I am able to move in until I find a new place in a few months and these rules are absurd.",

            "selftext": "We all got wasted last night and my friend [F20] told me [M20] I could crash at hers since I didn\u2019t have a way to get home. She slept in her roommate\u2019s bed while I stayed in hers. Now I\u2019m awake in bed and it\u2019s getting kind of late in the morning but I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s awake yet and I don\u2019t just want to get up and start parading around her apartment while she\u2019s asleep. I don\u2019t know what to do.\n\nIf it\u2019s not already obvious, I have anxiety. I also haven\u2019t ever \u201ccrashed\u201d at someone\u2019s place before after a night out. I don\u2019t know what to do and I\u2019m worried about doing the wrong thing.\n\nEDIT: I decided to go sit on the couch. Now what? When do I leave? Should I wait for her to wake up to greet her before I go? Or should I just walk out and text her about it? I\u2019m so lost.\n\nUPDATE: I didn\u2019t expect this to blow up, but thanks to those who tried to help. I ended up sending a text to say thank you and to let her know I was leaving as I was gathering my things (made sure to clean up and make the bed), just as she was getting up. She told me to stay, so we had some breakfast together and I confessed to her that I hadn\u2019t really known what to do with myself, which she found funny and assured me it would have been fine either way, but she was glad she caught me before I left. Thanks for easing my mind during this, I really was freaking out but I guess I shouldn\u2019t have put so much pressure on myself. This makes me feel much better for next time. Thanks everyone.\n\nUpdate 2: Wow, this got way more attention than I was expecting. Thanks again to everyone offering their advice, I'm glad so many people have been so understanding. Anxiety is a bitch I guess and this morning just felt like something that was a lot bigger and more stressful than it maybe seemed to anyone else. I also probably should have mentioned that she's a fairly new friend that I'm still not entirely comfortable around yet so I felt a lot of pressure to give a good impression, especially with her being nice enough to let me stay at her place. I also appreciate a lot of people pointing out that it seems like she could be interested in forming a closer relationship with me, which is really reassuring. I think she's a really cool person and I'd love to form a closer bond with her, so I'm glad that seems to be how she feels too. I can't really say for certain whether that bond will involve romance, but I'm just glad to have someone like her in my life. At the very least I'd love to get to a point where I'm comfortable enough with her not to panic about what to do if I wake up after crashing at her place.",

            "selftext": "I\u2019ve (M32) been with my girlfriend (F29) for over a year now. She\u2019s smart, funny, a bit quirky, and has a serious job with a good salary. We have a great time together and generally get along very well. The only thing is her choice in home \u2018decor\u2019 is bizarre, to put it frankly, and not something you think a normal, grown adult would be into. \n\nHer apartment is definitely a reflection of herself and interests. Not in the best way though. \n\nMy girlfriend has wall dedicated to animation in one room of her apartment, like Futurama pieces and etchings of some weird triangle guy. Then there\u2019s the wall of framed preserved insects in another room. But not insects like butterflies or moths. Instead she displays tarantulas, beetles, and large stick insects. Her bathroom has a subtle theme of the ocean-pretty common. But instead of starfish or shells, she has a little anglerfish nightlight, a small vampiric squid painting, and then a framed diagram of what apparently is a Goblin Shark right by the toilet. \n\nI would say a majority of her home decor and furnishings are okay. The apartment itself is very modern and sleek. It\u2019s just the random decor and juvenile-ish themes like cartoons, insects, and bizarre ocean creatures, is off putting.\n\nThis is where I might be the AH. I avoid bringing people over to her place, especially people from my job, because of how juvenile it looks. Everyone\u2019s impressed when they see the high rise, but that quickly fades once you enter. The one time I brought a work colleague over they ended up telling me after that they found her insect wall terrifying. I work in finance and appearances and first impressions are important.\n\nMy office will hold casual gatherings where we get together for a few drinks, good food, and we rotate hosts. And this time, it\u2019s my turn. The problem is my place is under some construction and not an ideal place to be right now, so I\u2019ve been staying with my girlfriend. My girlfriend suggested that we host my colleagues here since she has the space and thinks it\u2019ll be fun. I told her I planned on skipping my rotation and seeing if the next person would be okay with hosting early. She kept pressing on why I didn\u2019t want them over here, so I finally said it\u2019s because her home decor is strange and not something a grown woman would have, and also that her insect wall horrified the one colleague that did come over. \n\nMy girlfriend got mad and said at the end of the day, it\u2019s not my space and these things bring her joy. She also said that she is indeed an adult woman, which is exactly why her apartment is decorated in such a manner. \n\nI love my girlfriend, I do. And it\u2019s okay to have different interests. But does an adult really need to decorate with them besides a few things here and there? I mean, my own mother asked if my girlfriend was autistic after she saw the entire apartment for the first time.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA for telling my girlfriend her home decor is the reason I won\u2019t host a work gathering at her place?",

Although the same problem would occur on a white background, the obvious choice should have been an image with a transparent background.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince I cannot edit this post, I uploaded a version with a white and transparent background here: [https://imgur.com/a/v4fptos](https://imgur.com/a/v4fptos)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOut of the 8.589.676 (non-admin) users that were a part of the event, 2.288.363 placed only a single pixel.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAgain, I am sorry if this caused any confusion.",

I am not OP. I've tried to hyperlink all of the resources/links from the post as is.\n\nQuick Summary of previous events: OOP is a woman and a lawyer. She stayed at an AirBnB in NYC in 2022. Upon completing the initial booking, the owner revealed the property had cameras monitoring the *inside* of the studio apartment. OOP sought to cancel and get refunded. Her other posts describe her attempts to receive the refund, suing AirBnB and taking them to arbitration and the process leading up to the arbitration itself over the course of several months in 2023.\n\n**Latest Update:**\n\n[**Case Closed (Airbnb, Cameras, Yadda Yadda Yadda)**](https://www.reddit.com/user/AtypicalCommonplace/comments/15np1c3/case_closed_airbnb_cameras_yadda_yadda_yadda/) Aug 10 2023\n\nTLDR: Our hearing was held Aug 1st, the arbitrator has 30 days to decide. Arbitration turned out to be a pretty awful experience and I'm not very hopeful but still glad I fought!\n\n[For the latest full case update you can go here -ish](https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/11saoz0/new_update_from_court_in_ongoing_case_airbnb/)\n\nI've been writing this post in my head in the two seconds I have each day now that I've morphed from single woman to mom of two (I met a single dad on reddit - RIP R4R - and my life is now utterly changed and I'm happier and more exhausted than I have ever been!) but now that I am over a week out I figured I'd post an update for anywhere who is still here!\n\nAs noted above, our hearing was finally held on August 1st and lasted SIX (6!!!) hours so was pretty mentally and emotionally exhausting. I keep thinking of things I should have said (of course now after the fact) but the long and short of the argument I was trying to make was that, look, if Airbnb is basically saying that you CAN have a camera in a private space then it COULD record the bed and, um, that's bad (and reminder, [against Airbnb's policies](https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/3061)).\n\nBut because Airbnb conceded that they would pay me what I was promised on September 26th, 2022 (almost a year ago! fun!) the hearing itself got super bogged down into the weeds of whether I had PROOF that there was a camera (reminder, I didn't because the first customer service rep told me that the hosts' acknowledgment that there was one wasn't enough). Their contention from the start has been that the [Terms of Service](https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/2908) basically make you sign away all of your rights and even if the company itself erred they aren't liable for anything. Side note - have y'all watched \"[Joan is Awful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jY1ecibLYo)\" because the whole ToS madness reminded me of that.\n\nOf course, my whole issue here is that it SHOULDN'T take someone 12+ hours, months of time, and filing a case in arbitration to get what was promised to them, and which they relied on, from a corporation that obviously has the time and resources to squash me like a little bug. They also argued that while the terms of service SAY that cameras can't be \"inside\" what they REALLY mean is \"inside and monitoring\" so, if that is the case , why not just remove the \"inside\" piece from the ambiguous language? I continue to be baffled why they fought this so hard but I digress. Here's what I wrote regarding that in my opening argument,\n\nWhen I began this case I was a single woman. I\u2019m have a partner and am the mother to two small children. Truth be told, if this were to happen today, I wouldn\u2019t have had the time or energy to spend a week of my vacation fighting customer service representatives, nor would I have had the ability to attempt to seek resolution or argue this matter in arbitration. I would have had to give up even though the law of promissory estoppel, as I will argue today, make it plainly clear that I was owed what I was promised.\n\nThus, should this case only result in my recouping of the $1,502.78, it, in effect, means that in order for a consumer to be able to effectively rely upon a promise made by a company, they must also be willing to jump through hours of time, months of effort, and eventually litigation in order to receive what was promised. The impact is a chilling effect - consumers are forced to choose between expending time and energy or simply \u201cgiving up.\u201d What of consumers who don\u2019t have the privilege of time? Where would their justice be?\n\nI think what was most surprising to me, though perhaps it shouldn't be, was the way in which the lawyers tried to attack my character. Saying I was doing this for youtube views (did I bring up the fact that the youtube video has since been removed by myself? lol no) or for a \"reddit following.\" They dug up reddit posts that I had made about this case in the heat of anger that I almost immediately realized were mean and unfair and so I took them down - but wayback is a thing and everything can be found and I guess they wanted to show that, yes, this case kind of turned me into an asshole at times. I kind of lost in in a tumbling bridge of sadness way at this point. We had already played recordings of me crying with customer service (embarrassing) and in order to \"prove\" that I was impacted by this I had to submit anxiety medications my doctor had prescribed me that I was then cross-examined on (double embarrassing), so I don't really get the point that was other than to try and kick me while I was down. Of course, I know the lawyers are only doing their jobs but I guess I felt sad that that is a job anyone would choose to do.\n\nSo - why am I still posting here, knowing that it could get me in trouble? Well, first I would argue to whoever is checking these posts that the hearing itself was never ordered to be confidential and I am not sharing anything deemed confidential but, more than that, I think that people have a right to know what they will be up against if they try and challenge a large corporation in arbitration which is meant to be a \"fair and efficient hearing.\" Unfortunately, my experiences in arbitration didn't feel that way at all. I suppose I could delightfully be proven wrong but, sadly, the moral of the story here, to me, is that it isn't worth it. Which, you know, is what corporations WANT us to think and feel so we DO give up. When both arbitration rules and a company's own terms of service (23.3 here) say you are supposed to enter into good faith negotiations before moving forward, and when a company fails to enter into these in any way shape or form - I think the rule should just be that the consumer wins. Otherwise we are enabling a massive imbalance of power that will only lead to the further erosion of fairness and consumer rights.\n\nBut who cares what I think ;)\n\nThe one silver lining in all of this has been receiving more mental health support. As y'all know, part of what frustrated me so much about this was the very real knowledge I have those cameras in private areas can and will ultimately lead to victimization from already marginalized people. And I've begun talking to my therapist about [secondary PTSD](https://www.brainline.org/article/secondary-ptsd-or-secondary-traumatic-stress-should-not-be-underestimated) and am looking into talking to psychology students who may be interested in a dissertation specifically on how 2PTSD impacts lawyers representing survivors.\n\nOh, and, of course, had I never received as much support from reddit I may never have turned my dating life over to the wonders of the anonymous internet (I used a throwaway account for my R4R post) and [wouldn't now have this in my life.](https://imgur.com/gallery/LGRDtPI) (OP's note. The link is to an image of a child's hand or hands intertwined with that of two adults.)\n\nSo, in the end.....\n\n* Audre Lorde was right, the master's tools cannot dismantle the master's house,\n* Arbitration is not as pro se and consumer-friendly as it is made out to be\n* If you're reading this airbnb, which I know you are, please please please please please please please don't allow cameras inside any private area. [The risk is, truly, too great.](https://osce.usmission.gov/taking-a-lesson-from-traffickers-harnessing-technology-to-further-the-anti-trafficking-movement/)\n* But reddit remains a pretty cool place.

If they decide to move from point A to point B without teleporting, when they are on the ground they walk with \"legs,\" (as would be perceived by humans) and when they are in the air they fly with \"wings\" (as would be perceived by humans).  But their mode of travel is still perceived by humans as a biological extension of their body, not some ship, car, boat or other craft as is falsely being alleged by the governments conducting the hoaxes and counter-hoaxes.\n\nSatanic-minded humans been hoaxing each other with \"UFO's\" for decades.  Sometimes they even create biological entities that don't exist (with gene editing technology that allows them to make all kinds of creatures that don't exist in nature), and they will take these fake \"aliens\" and place them inside a fake \"UFO\" and then crash it somewhere to hoax some dumb-ass group of competing humans into spending trillions to research a pile of human-made technology trash. Humans have also figured out how to project images and sounds into the sky, of any size or volume (from the size of a car to the size of 100 skyscrapers, and with the volume of a lightning strike), giving the appearance of anything just hovering and making sounds in the sky.  They could project an image of Max Headroom into the sky, the size of the New Years Blimp, and have him talking to you (like some talking head in the sky).  They use laser-based holograms and directed-energy audio waves to do this, and it is all technology made by humans that has NOTHING to do with ET.\n\nIf you believe that \"aliens\" are using \"spaceships\" to visit us from another solar system, I have a bridge in Brooklyn for sale if you are interested.

There's definitely some other origins involved in the Melusine names. For example, one in the city was called Menthe, which I believe comes from Greek mythology (a nymph who was tranformed into mint).\n\nThere's many others that I'm not familiar with any particular origin to their names.

The war of the magi. \n\nAt first I was like, Yoshi is a fan of the first 6 games so he probably does what he normally does and takes ideas from them. But this time it felt different. They make references to Ultima many times and even talk about how magic use to be plentiful amongst the people until it did not exist anymore.\n\nMore so, the Esper Ramuh that talks to Locke tells him that Espers use to walk with and among humans, bestowing their magic on them to help society thrive. And then Celes talks about the stories of fiction they were told as children.  \n\nAnd finally with the photos I posted, it immediately prompted me to come share my theory that the FFVI world (like Ivalice\u2019s connection to XII & XIV) is in fact the same world as XVI, 1,000 years in the future. \n\nAt this point I\u2019m nearly convinced.

I don't recall any scene where the Eikons spoke of themselves as other beings, it was always the dominant's personality and mind driving it, except after Clyve took their powers and they tried to prime, and even then it was like a berserk state and not an Eikons personality.",
                "This reeeeaaalllyyy makes me want a FFVI Remake (FF7 style)",
                "Warring Triad.\n\nThree gods descended from the heavens , Demon , Fiend and  Goddess and, fearing one another's power, began to war. The mortals caught among their fighting became espers and were forced to fight as slaves to the gods. The gods realized the chaos their fighting was causing and agreed to seal away their power. \n\nWar or the triad\n\nLong ago the Warring Triad descended from the heavens and, fearing one another's power, began to war. To gain the upper hand they enslaved mortals to fight for them, turning them into espers and introducing magic to the world. Little is known about the course of the war, apart from none of the gods being able to gain the upper hand.\n\n\nWar of the Magi \n\nEspers and humans lived in peace for a time until another war broke out when humans attempted to seize the espers' power for themselves. Humans infused with esper magic came into existence, called \"magi\". A battle took place inside the Ancient Castle where the king, an esper named Odin, was petrified defending the castle from enemies, including enemy espers and a powerful sorcerer. The esper Valigarmanda was frozen and buried to be discovered a thousand years later in the northern mines. Various other espers became magicite and their shards were lost.\n\nThere came to be two \"Ultima Weapons\": the first was a destructive monster with incredible magical powers, and the other was a powerful sword, which drew its power from the user's vitality.\n\nFrom what I know , I didn't finish FFXVI , Clive didn't die so, I don't know how humanity could destroy The World of Balance when there is 0 magic and espers in Valisthea.\n\nYou can say that the War of Magi resonates with FFXVI , but the whole motive of the war was because the Warring Triad was a thing before.",
                "hey so i hate to be the bearer of bad news but Ultima weapons have been a thing in several Final Fantasy games. the name Ultima has been around for a long time.\n\neven in Kingdom Hearts the best keyblade in the game is usually called the Ultima Weapon\n\nit\u2019s a fun theory, but i\u2019m afraid it needs more evidence apart from references to Ultima, since it\u2019s one of those reoccurring names in the games (like Cid, Biggs, or Wedge)",

                "Jesus no. Its all fun to come up with theories but I refuse to accept that any of the mainline final fantasys are connected. They are all simply different universes. \n\nAny references to characters, reoccurring themes etc. Are all just simply fun easter eggs that fans can enjoy.",
                "FF is famous for referencing previous FFs without being directly related to one another. It\u2019d be like saying all of the FFs that feature crystals or a mothercrystal are related. \n\nThe Ivalice references in XIV are just that, references. It\u2019s not the actual area or the same story as in Tactics. It would be cool if they were directly connected but they\u2019re not. Ivalice in itself can be interpreted as an in-universe FF, where each iteration (T, TA, TA2, XII&RW, XIV, retroactively VS) is a different telling of a similar world \u2013 note how each game begins as if it\u2019s being told from a journal or tome.",

I'm not saying that 16 is put in the same world set as 14, but rather a lot of themes in Final Fantasy repeat themselves. Cid, chocobos, the mother crystal, the war of the Magi, etc.\n\nMultiple games within the franchise refer to a 'war of the Magi'. That does not mean that they are all the same war. It's just one of many recurring Final Fantasy tropes.",
                "While there's too much that disproves these being the same world I do think it would be interesting for a main FF game to go back to the world of a previous main game and do it 1,000 years later like was done with the Lunar games in the 90's.",
                "Pretty sure the War of the Magi happened in XVI 850 years before the start of the game, and that's what caused them to sign the Continental Accord enslaving all Bearers, so that the magic users would never be in a position of power to cause that much damage again.",
                "If you buy enough drinks from the bar in XVI, they tell a story that has easter eggs that would actually put VI as the prequel to XVI, referring to two airship pilots where one died and the other took up their legacy, directly naming the airships.",

                "As others have mentioned they\u2019re not related but as an older gamer. I loved the call backs. \n\nSome others are that the warring triad turned themselves to stone. You had a character who could turn themselves into an esper/eikon for a larger portion of the game. Magic users were enslaved.  Odin losing a fierce battle at his castle. One random kick ass moogle. \n\nI\u2019m sure there\u2019s plenty of other Easter eggs I missed but did appreciate the ones I found.",
                "It's just one of the many things FFs share. FFVI is set on a world where magic usage has been borderline eradicated and people are developing newer technologies, the 1000 years period mentioned is more of a reference to the previous FFs and their medieval setting, from FFVI onward we see a creep up of technological advancement. Steampunk with FF6, early 1940s   \n oil discovery with FF7, FF8 futurism, FF9 breaks the standard but that was the point, FFX picks it up with a mix of a futuristic tech and magic, XII has alternative tech (medieval society with premitive terrestrial transport but highly advanced flying vehicles), XIII ramps it up, XV is straight up modern age.\n\nSo that line was basically to allude to medieval style magic past.",
                "Without an official confirmation it's just a fun theory, but it's interesting. It could be talking about the two in game references but also inspire 16 as well, who is to say the name Ultima being revered as \"most powerful\" isn't actually more evidence in the theories favor. Either way it wouldn't be the first time such a connection were hinted at, though 7 and 10 is more obvious with its hint.",
                "Definitely not in the same world in any way. FF16 has a TON of references to other FF games just like every other FF game has references to other FF games. 16 just goes pretty hard into it and is much more in your face about it compared to others in the series.\n\nYou even said it yourself in your post Ramuh says the Espers used to walk with and among humans. In FF6, Espers are their own living beings. In 16, they are nothing more than machinations created by Ultima to serve his end goal. They do not exist independently from humans. If humans did not exists, Eikons do not either. The same cannot be said of Espers.\n\nThen you have the Ultima reference. In FF6 it mentions 2 weapons with the same name being used in the war of the Magi; Ultima Weapon, the Weapon, and Ultima Weapon, the Beast. Many FF games have Ultima Weapons, the weapon, and likewise, the beast, FF7 being the most well known.\n\nHere is a list of \"Beast\" Ultima Weapons - https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Ultima_Weapon_(creature)\n\nAnd Weapon, Ultima Weapons - https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Ultima_Weapon_(weapon)\n\nSo yea, there is no connection other than the typical Final Fantasy connection.",

The XIV connection to XII is just a homage or a recreation of Ivalice with no actual connection to the orginal.  \n\n\nBetter reference would have been the VII & X world connection where the theory is that the people of spira are the original Ancients (centra) of VII and traveled to Gaia from Spira, then Shinra company is formed or based off of Shin-Ra from X-2",

This more or less forces you to tune to win. I like having the option of tuning, but I hate feeling like some degree of it is necessary if I want to win. In a battle of equally tuned 700PP cars, I feel like I should have a fighting chance without having to play half a lap of catch-up.\n\nGrid Starts, on the whole, started going away in GT5 and were almost nonexistent by GT Sport. I don't even recall if there's a single grid-start race in campaign mode in GT7. \n\nThis is why I still love playing GT on my PSP. All the races are grid start!

I found them entertaining and enjoyable, but I didn't quite share in the hype I see on social media. \n\nSo many things in this novel bothered me and I just have to gripe-\n\n\\*Spoilers below\\*\n\nIn order of how much they bothered me:\n\n1. **The ending where Harriet gives up her career.** The whole book, I was waiting for her to maybe switch residency programs and go into family medicine in Montana? Or perhaps become a caretaker to Gloria and go into a specialty related to her disease? I know this book is fiction, but I just couldn't buy the fact that anyone would get into a top neurosurgery program and then quit to make minimum wage. She would be financially ruined, in lifelong massive debt, without health insurance and totally reliant on a man she just got back together with. I just couldn't suspend my disbelief. (Maybe if pottery had been her lifelong passion and not just a fleeting hobby?) \n2. **The book was so melancholy.** The structure of the main romantic arch was such that the first 90% of the book really focused on the breakup and feelings of sadness and anger that Harriet experienced. Maybe 2nd chance romance just isn't a trope I like? I typically prefer watching the characters fall for each other, have cute flirtatious banter, experience their first kiss etc. I guess if when I read a romance book, I'm looking for a light pick me up and this definitely veered into \"women's fiction\" territory for me.\n3. **The main romance seemed to be all about physical chemistry**. I struggled to see what Wyn and Harriet had besides amazing chemistry. I did like how the book explored her relationship with Wyn's family, but I felt like it was all spice and physical attraction and didn't buy that they were actually super compatible.\n4. **The friend group seemed immature.** Maybe at 35 I was too old to read this book? I got annoyed at the descriptions of selfish and wealthy 20-somethings getting drunk and high. They were supposed to be such good friends, but they didn't share things like plans to have a baby, change careers, etc? Was anyone really supporting Wyn as he lost his father and became caretaker for his mother?\n\nI am just so disappointed and I wish I had waited for a library copy instead of buying it!",

                "The ending really annoyed me too! My husband works as a medical residency coordinator so I just could not get passed someone quitting in the middle of their residency year to teach pottery. I know several people who have changed specialties, some even taking gap years waiting get rematched, but all continued to work in research or the medical field while it happened. She would have hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt eating away at their HEA and it didn't seem like her family or Wyn were well off to make it a non issue. There's a lot of believable alternatives between neurosurgeon and part time pottery teacher.",
                "I haaaaaaaaated this book (started getting annoyed 45% through and hate-read to the end hoping there would be a twist that made it all make sense), and actively warned my reader friends that it leans much much more into woman\u2019s fiction than romance. \n\nI agree with all of your issues with the book. Complete lack of chemistry, emotional maturity, or communication. Drove me up the wall. \n\nI agree with you that it might be an age thing. I\u2019m 43 and it\u2019s been more than a few years since I\u2019ve been able to read NA or Romance with young twenty MCs for pure escapism anymore. \n\nI own Book Lovers, and I\u2019ll read the next Emily Henry book, but she is definitely on my library read-only list.",

But in this case the scenario is paying of hundreds of thousands in loans. \n\nI\u2019m not in medicine, have friends and family making their way through medical school and residency right now, and her decision to quit is what ruined the book for me.\n\nHarriet babe, rural areas pay so well too. Could\u2019ve finished off residency and moved to MT and made a crap ton more while working less in a much more cheaper town. \n\nBeach Read > Book Lovers > PWMOV > Happy Place.",
                "I completely agree, I was super disappointed by this one for the same reasons! Harriet\u2019s choices throughout the story were largely incomprehensible to me - they were consistent with the character as written, I guess, but it was just hard for me to buy the idea that she had spent so many years being a people-pleaser for so many different people without anyone ever noticing the proverbial crack in her armor and poking it a little bit? I just imagine the three women sitting in their apartment having conversations in which no one ever interrogates Harriet in the way that I think friends often naturally do, and it just didn\u2019t compute for me. (But maybe I actually know nothing about human nature and relationships, IDK.)",
                "My head would explode if I had read that book. I stay away from anything medical in my fiction which I assume is why this book never really popped up on my radar, but I can assure you no one leaves residency lightly. The weird thing about medicine is it leaves you extremely qualified for medicine and pretty much unqualified for anything else, all while putting you in the kind of debt that you can only pay back by getting a job in medicine. When I finished training, I owed something like $300k in student loans. You can't just... find another way with debt like that.",

And Funny Story was more like \u201cthe breeze in your hair on the weekend\u201d (referencing a Taylor Swift lyric). \n\nAs a Charlie Lastra die hard, Wyn was just never gonna be my cup of tea. And Harriet HAS to do some doctoring in rural Montana and get some student loan forgiveness. Sitting on a pile of debt while making crap pottery and getting high 8 days a week I guess would be fine for a while, but a motivated person does reset to motivated after getting rest.",
                "I\u2019ll sing it to the moon and back. I was so unhappy about this book. I preordered it anticipating it because I\u2019ve loved all of EH\u2019s other books. I was so EXCITED. but it literally was an emotional vampire of a story. I could not believe  what I read was from the same author. There was zero happiness in it to me. It just solidified that I HATE miscommunication tropes a million times more. \n\nI agree on your take on the entire group of friends. The friend group especially. I forget the name of the girl who\u2019s cabin it was but she pissed me off to no end. She was controlling and wanted everything to be her exact way.",

                "I think the issue of tone with her books is so interesting. Because it\u2019s not just about being heavy or light. Books can be heavy and deal with heavy issues, but leave you with an overall good feeling (your happy place LOL) at the end. And I think this is what many of us want from romance. We want the heroine to have it all. We want to walk away feeling good. \n\nSo her books are really interesting to me - I think she\u2019s a great writer, but I also feel down when I finish one. So I only read these when I want that feeling. Even the heavy romances I read, which are not dark romances but sometimes have dark elements, leave me feeling more satisfied and uplifted in the end. \n\nI do think she has a unique voice. But again I agree about the tone. Leaves me feeling sad, even though they\u2019re together.",

                "Emily Henry makes me realise we need to talk about financial privilege in romance because woo boy, switching from medical to teach pottery is not a sound financial decision to make and reeks of someone who has generational wealth to fall back on (whether that's the author or the character). The flippancy of Harriet's decision is kind of insulting to people to who have worked so hard for so long making careers out of the arts and here's this woman just like \"lol! I quit my life to teach pottery on a whim!\"\n\n100% believe Harriet and Wyn wouldn't last another 6 months with each other and would be broken up, Harriet no doubt discarding her \"passion\" job and going back to medical.",
                "Miscommunication/lack of communication trope is one of my least favorites and this book could have basically not existed if they had just talked for 5 minutes a couple months prior.   \nAnd not only did Harriet give up medicine but she just didn\u2019t seem to me to have the personality of a neurosurgeon. I feel like most surgeons, maybe especially neurosurgeons, are not such keep-quiet people pleasers. Maybe a different type of medicine would have felt more realistic to me.",
                "It's like I wrote this 5 min after I finished the book 2 months ago. Particularly point #1. Spot on.",
                "I haven\u2019t read the book but as a current medical resident, I\u2019m so glad I didn\u2019t. Just reading \u201cshe quit a top neurosurgery program to teach pottery\u201d makes me violently angry at how unrealistic that is.",
                "This was a very bad book. The FMC just leaves her career and follows a guy because that\u2019s what \u2018makes her happy\u2019. Imagine the financial debt she would have accumulated because of med school!!! You\u2019re really going to let the FMC behave so irresponsibly (financially) and let the readers think that that\u2019s ok? Like HELL, IS THAT MAN GOING TO PAY HER DEBT? Save the damsel in financial distress???\n\nALSO, after being with eachother for so many years the main issue between the FMC and MMC was basically poor communication or the lack of it. Such a bad plot. I don\u2019t see myself reading another Emily Henry book.\n\nPS- I did not enjoy holding the heavy hardcover copy.",
                "I preordered without reading the synopsis and I just can\u2019t get myself to read it. This trope is not my favorite and all the reviews I keep seeing list their problems which I would agree with and I just don\u2019t want to deal with it right now.",
                "You articulated precisely what I disliked about the whole book.",
                "Harriet\u2019s choice about her career bothered me so much. I genuinely don\u2019t understand why she didn\u2019t switch specialities into something that felt more meaningful to her.",
                "My unpopular opinion? None of the books after beach read has made me want to read them. I even side eye the ending of beach read as well, the fmc was starting to grate on me but I just could not put my finger in why.",
                "I agree with everything you wrote! As a woman in medicine, I was so let down by this book and found the false-dichotomy of \u201cpracticing medicine vs. happiness\u201d to be so reductive and frustrating. There were so many more interesting avenues that she could have explored in terms of women in demanding careers finding balance with their friendships and romantic relationships. \n\nEveryone in that friend group came off as if they were 17 years old. I could not buy into these people being adults, even young adults. \n\nI read this on vacation and ended up ranting about how dumb it was to my husband for the rest of the trip.",
                "Yes agree agree! And after I finished I was like \u201cwhy were people crying to this book? Did I miss something?\u201d Maybe I\u2019m too mature for this one I\u2019m 36.",
                "Agreed! As I said in some other thread, I feel like Emily's first venture into a FMC having a job outside publishing/writing, while refreshing, really shows in terms of shallowness and inaccuracy. Settle down and become a family doctor or work as a medical liaison? I don't think Wyn is going to pay off all your debt.",
                "This one wasn't my favorite of Emily Henry's but my biggest issue was the main plot centered around miscommunication. No one was communicating with anyone. If Wyn and Harriet communicated they never would have broken up in the first place and spent the entire book hooked up on misunderstandings. \n\nI get that it seemed ridiculous for her to up and quit her residency this far in but I feel like people gloss over she didn't love or even like it and only became a doctor because she thought that's what overachieving smart kids did and all she wanted was her parents approval. Also her career was literally what was keeping her from Wyn and the long distance didn't work.\n\nI also feel like people forget Wyn revealed to her he was literally making tables at fifteen thousand a pop.\n\nBut alas that's kind of what I like about Emily Henry's books. I like that the characters aren't perfect and don't make perfect decisions.",
                "What drove me crazy was the dialogue. People don't talk like that in real life! I love witty banter but this was just too much for me. It's like she decided early on that the characters all had to all be able to respond in one liners and funny retorts. Not for me.",
                "I think the only reason your first point seemed reasonable to me is because I know someone who did something similar. \n\nShe finished med school and was two years into a residency (I think for psychiatry) when she realized it wasn\u2019t for her. So she got her teaching certificate and taught high school science for two years. \n\nThen she decided that wasn\u2019t for her either and left again. \n\nI do like second chance romance as a trope, and I liked the book overall, but not as much as her other ones. I think I would have liked it less if I didn\u2019t know someone who dropped medicine well into their residency, because that does seem farfetched with all of the debt and everything that goes into it. But I know that it does happen.",
                "I disliked it too, especially Harriet giving up medicine. And the reason for their breakup made me want to throw something\n\nHonestly it felt like EH knowing very little about medicine and especially surgical residents",
                "I didn\u2019t finish this. I think I read maybe 3-4 chapters before abandoning it. I thought it was me (and I loved Book Lovers). I couldn\u2019t put my finger on what exactly was bothering me about it but your second point really hit for me. It was just so sad and angsty. Not what I expect when I pick up a romance. I\u2019ve done okay with second chance romances before but they way it was done here wasn\u2019t appealing. \n\nI\u2019m also in my mid 30s and even in the first couple chapters the friend group really annoyed me. \n\nIt makes me wonder why people love it as much as they say they do. Is it just name recognition at this point?",
                "People should read [this Vulture profile](https://www.vulture.com/article/emily-henry-romance-novel-profile.html) of EmHen if they haven't yet.  It explained a lot about her first few books & gave me a clear perspective on what to expect in the next ones... which is very much NOT traditional romance imo.  I still enjoy them (a lot!) for what they are, it's just not what I'd have expected based on the stereotypical illustrated covers.",
                "Want to butt in and say the purpose of the friend group was to show that you can be close as ever, but sometimes natural progression of friendship is kind of drifting apart. You get older, you move away, you have actual adult responsibilities and sometimes your friendships take a backseat. Also what\u2019s the shame in getting drunk or high on vacation?",
                "same thoughts, i really wanted to drop the book but i was already 3/4 done and decided to just endure it till the end.\n\nI hated the friend group so much. They're literally in their late twenties (or 30s, i forgot) and they're acting as if they're still high schoolers. I never felt anything for Harriet and Wyn. I'm not huge on second-chance romances and for it to work for me, the second chance has to be *really* earned and in the book, it really wasn't.\n\nAnd yeah, Harriet giving up her career was ????",
                "Oh. I finished it last night. It was a rare five star.\n\nI think it gave me hope. My partner and I have been having issues because of how we communicate, so I really empathised with Harriet and Wyn and their relationship struggles.\n\nI also empathise with Harriet and her work situation. I work in finance in role that requires qualifications and approval from the regulator. I worked so hard to get where I am. But I hate it for various reasons, most of which are not directly related to the job itself, and so I\u2019ve taken a job that\u2019s in a more junior role in the industry (less stress) but I\u2019m also trying to work out if I can work for myself, doing something I\u2019m more passionate about. I think it\u2019s really important for people to understand it\u2019s never too late to reskill and change industry if you aren\u2019t happy at work, and loved that part of the story.\n\nThe friendships, I agree with you, they seem immature, but then again, I\u2019m in my early 30s and I have a few friends that behave like that. I totally understand the drifting and not telling your friends things. I have a close group of friends, and I very rarely tell the group as a whole what\u2019s going on in my life, there\u2019s a whole bunch of reasons why, but we just aren\u2019t as close as we were and have loads of things going on, babies, renovation projects, exams etc.\n\nI agree the book is very melancholy, but that didn\u2019t put me off. I also agree about Harriet and Wyn\u2019s relationship. It feels like a shallow plot device, and I didn\u2019t really know what they saw in each other.",
                "Yeah this was my least favorite for the same reasons. They were all so dumb and immature.",
                "I also didn\u2019t enjoy it that much but probably for other reasons than most of the people here: Up until like 80%, I was convinced they wouldn\u2019t end up together again. I thought it was so obvious that they weren\u2019t compatible and has different goals in life. And tbh, I would\u2019ve LOVED that. The way it was built up made sense to me. I was like \u201cYeah, no, they\u2019re not a good match.\u201d I was so excited to read a romance book where we were actually shown why two people are NOT a good match. Lol well. So yeah, safe to say I also didn\u2019t enjoy the ending \ud83d\ude02",
                "I liked the book agree with all your points. Something felt a bit off throughout.\n\nTheir chemistry did seem mostly physical, and the fact that they were together a decade and literally broke up over a miscommunication where neither even tried to talk to each other is just something that seems so immature. I mean, I\u2019ve been in relationships with terrible communication (ahem, my SO) and I can\u2019t believe even one of them wouldn\u2019t try to say something or have a fight instead of just being like \u2018ok, bye forever\u2019????\n\nIt also really irks me when these stories have these wild friend groups who are all super intimate, touchy feely, do everything together, and have these outlandish trips away. It reminded me of the friend group in \u2018Between Us\u2019. Idk, I know there are some friend groups out there like that, but personally I don\u2019t know anyone who has that. I certainly don\u2019t. I find it unrelatable. It comes across as too try-hard and forced in the writing IMO.",
                "I stopped reading at 40% it felt like going over the same things, and they had nothing going for them as a couple besides being horny....\nI spoilt the ending and was thankful I didn't continue.  I was never a Emily Henry fan but I didn't mind certain things about her books and writing but this one felt so flat. It'll be interesting to see what the next book is like...",
                "I\u2019m considering this my permission to give up reading it, I\u2019m not super far in but I\u2019ve been massively struggling to get excited about it."

I\u2019ve seen what he was convicted of, let\u2019s just say it\u2019s not just getting caught in a car in a parking lot with his gf. Idk exactly how far the house is from the bus stop, but it makes me uncomfortable. Short of taking my son to and from school (which isn\u2019t always going to be an option for us unfortunately, my car is on its last leg rn), is there anything else I can do? Will the school take this seriously or tell me \u201cit\u2019s over the amount of distance he needs to be from children\u201d or something like that.\n\nEdit: the bus stop is about 150-200ft from the house in question. We live in Ohio.\n\nEdit again: I\u2019m still going to call just to make sure they\u2019re aware, but now that the bus has actually came (they started on a 2 hr delay), they actually stop further down than what has been marked on the little map thing.

                "First off, I'm a skeptic. I like UFO subs so Reddit recommends more of them to me, sorry I'm bursting your insular bubble. Feel free to delete / down vote. \n\nIf I was a believer, I would still disbelieve a shit ton of stuff posted on these UFO subs. Everyone is a skeptic, it's just a spectrum. I'm on one side and you guys are on another for this topic, but I guarantee there are other topics where our skeptisim matches. Ghosts, Scientology, bigfoot, etc. \n\nThe human experience is that of wrongness. From your perspective think of all the people misinterpreting NHI as religious experiences. People misconstrue, fabricate and even when they are somehow correct, they can miscommunicate. This propogates wrongness further than the initial truth. Even when truth is properly communicated well then we are back to step 1, where people will misinterpret or extrapolate beyond the bounds of what was originally true. \n\nHumans are wrong, but they don't function if they assume they are wrong. Trust me, I've tried, there is too much to take into account, too much to be wrong about. So the brain is forced to take the position that it is fundamentally correct despite how glaringly wrong it is on so many occasions. \n\nThere is often a belief that you can \"feel\" truth. I'll know it when I see it kind of stuff. That you can detect a lie from an honest statement. This too is false. You cannot. You're truth detection will be about as effective as flipping a coin in the grand scheme of things. But if you flipped a coin and got heads a few times, suddenly you believe you are good at flipping heads versus tails? Bullshit. It's just the human brain finding patterns where there is none. You're looking for big cats in the tall grass my man. \n\nSo what the fuck am I even saying. I'm not saying I know it's not NHI cause I don't, but because I don't know I won't go assuming I do know the answer. Until the aliens are as well understood and documented as atoms and the periodic table I'm going to stay skeptical. I don't really care if you take the same position as me cause the world would be really boring if that was the case. You guys are my entertainment so keep on keeping on I guess. Just don't let your head fall out. \n\nLots of people fell down the rabbit hole for nonsense like flat earth or q anon and baked their mind into a pretzel. Just because you've convinced yourself that doesn't have any bearing on the reality of the situation. That's my TLDR I guess.",

            "selftext": "So my boyfriend and I were going to order some pizza hut but I had to call them to get my discount added. I called the location and when we hit he payment area in the convo I mentioned I had $20 store credit and the guy said he needed to transfer me to the store and have them deal with my order to get it added. I thought it was weird because I called the number for the store but whatever, said it was fine to transfer. At no point did I give any card information or confirm the order verbally, all I said was I wanted to get transferred to see if I could get store credit applied before purchasing the food. Well when he transferred me the fucking store hung up so I said fuck it and ordered pizza from a local pizza company that was better quality wise and ended up getting it cheaper too. Not ten minutes after I ordered the food from the other pizza company, I got a text from doordash that my Dasher picked up the pizza hut order and was on their way. I texted the number provided and said to cancel because I didn't order pizza hut and tried to call them to cancel it but got no response. The dasher shows up and I told them what happened. Oddly enough, someone at pizza hut fucked up and marked the order as paid for (despite not having my card and it was over $20 of food) so I told the Dasher to keep the food and was sorry they had to drive here. She was happy as hell though and didn't mind. Hopefully made this Dashers night because she mentioned she was very hungry and would take anything. TLDR: pizza hut hung up on me, somehow finished my order, confirmed it without telling me, and marked it as paid so I gave the dasher the food since I had already ordered food from somewhere else because of pizza hut hanging up.",

Domino's too but not as bad\n\nSounds like they used that credit\n\nI don't blame you for giving up on Pizza Hut. I am surprised you were able to get local pizza for cheaper though. My experience is pizza hut and Papa John's coupons are hard to beat (doesn't have anything to do with quality though). Maybe you're in a larger city or on the east coast. Sometimes local pizzerias can be cheaper in those instances\n\nSounds like Dasher was happy to get the free food. Probably hard to afford a decent meal with the way they pay their contractors lol"

                "Things that kill an LGS for me:\n\n1. Shitty Management of the store - You could have great employees But if your shitty at management the store will collapse. but this will also go into other points now too...\n2. Overpriced - I'm not talking about the supply/demand increase which goes up but not skyrocket.  When We all know you got the product at one price, amazon and such are selling at a flat price, and box stores have it...if your 3x-4x out of the gate you make it where no one wants to buy the product.  Then you sit on it and complain you can't pay the bills.  Watched one store pretty much go bankrupt cause they refuse to sell any cheaper.\n3. Catering to bad \"players\" (LOL WE PROS kind) - You know the kind... The ones \"friends\" with the store.  The ones that treat the store like its there home turf. The ones That take advantage of newer players and/or push them out.  The ones who act like they are the reason the store stays afloat.....BUT buys all there shit off TCGplayer and ebay.  \n\n4. And now the more recent issue - The over policing of players for the sake of a small group (This is OUR safe SPACE kind) - This is as damaging as the protour moms basement bros. Except the bros don't hide their intent.  This one sugar coats the poison and acts like its a fucking cure.  They too also don't spend shit at the store as it interferes with other purchases like POPS and other \"nerdy\" items cause \"nerds are cool now\"  \n\n5. The one thing we all see, can agree, and get pissed at - Lack of fucking effort to maintain the store - There is nothing to add on this. Its self explained and you see it with how the store looks like shit after a few months.\n\nThere is other things I could add but I am hungry and food awaits me.",

                "The main sticking points for me.\n\n1. It's only Commander. They eliminated all other formats besides Commander, and don't even attempt to revive them. You play Commander or nothing.\n\n\n2. Too supportive of players. The organizers will always support players in their games, even if it is really time to give that player a gameplay infraction. I've been in multiple events where this one player has gone to time every single match. Multiple events of nothing but draws due to time. Just give them slow play already!!!",

I wish I could still play there every so often for the circus and uniquely odd experience it was for me.

The  only downside is that the store is slowing down a lot on MTG as a supported game. So can't buy much product of needed\n(They mostly do boardgames and a few wargames)",
                "Dont have one anymore but the worst thing was the people who would take up multiple tables with their shit and then never play a game. These two used to come in, unpack their crap onto 3 tables then sit on the floor and play on their phones for hours. Also, commander players.",

                "Things that make my LGS a cool place to hang:\n\n-Free table space for card games, board games, AND large TTRPG specific tables. \n\n-Consistent group of about 20 people who are good friends with the owner that show up to almost all events even if we don\u2019t care about the game. You\u2019ll see a packed store for a damn digimon TCG event just because we all like to see each other. \n\n-Owner has a heart of gold and has often from his own pocket helped many people with personal financial troubles. \n\n-LGS is completely apolitical and a spot where you don\u2019t have to worry about saying the wrong thing and being ostracized. \n\n-All members of store staff are some level of MtG judge, meaning all rules debates are settled quickly. \n\n-Extremely low number of crusty people and weirdos. Patrons for the most part are all 25 and older with families and real jobs. \n\n-Most importantly: prices are not over inflated. Obviously the store has to make a profit but there\u2019s no $60 draft might. The volume the store does due to its popularity allows for good deals.",

                "Personal gripes can drive a lot of players away from or towards a specific store. My friend experienced X or I witnessed Y at this store, so you shouldn't go there. Most local communities are tight knit so word of mouth carries substantial weight. I try to keep an open mind and separate player experience from store atmosphere, but it's not that easy for others, and I'm sure some people's interactions can be much more jarring than mine.\n\nMy only bad experience was with an employee, and it was less of a \"this employee treated me poorly\" encounter and more of a \"this employee triggered himself in an argument he started with his boss in front of a group of six players and stormed out\" kinda thing. And I attribute that to a bad employee and not a bad store.\n\nThe only other store near me feels a little less like home if that makes sense, so I tend to frequent the former.",
                "Is it common for people to treat an LGS like a free babysitting service for their unruly sixth graders or am I just lucky",
                "I have had the pleasure of having both the best and worst LGS I've ever experienced being my \"main\" stores.\n\nThe worst had only six regulars every FNM back when that was the only way to play Magic, the prize pool was half of what any other store gave, but the store never closed and had those consistent six players because of a combination of the fact that the store was the only store for 20 miles and was set up in a relatively isolated part of town where the manager had a day job to fund the fact that the store had no player base. They would constantly blast music really loudly, but that music would either be one of two albums that they cycled through on repeat every night. They were next to an obvious front smoke shop back when weed was not legal in our state, and everybody in the store was constantly smoking indoors so that it didn't waft to the other stores in the shopping center. The selection was terrible, there were hardly any singles, and the store owner would pretty much crack every single box wizards sent him unless somebody pre-ordered it from him (for a markup) And for some reason it seemed like \"He never pulled any of the good singles\" (but it just so happens that he got the new rarest card from the set for his shitty commander deck \"from an out of town guy who came in on Tuesday when nobody was here and traded it for a really good unnamed card the manager forgot that he definitely had.) We had this one guy who was a regular who would bring us free pizza, and that was kind of cool, except we would delay FNMs for *everyone* when he was late (which was almost every week) and when he showed up everybody thought it was okay to not only eat their pizza without plates but while they were playing. \"It's okay, the cards are sleeved!\"\n\nThere was one point where one of the regulars assaulted somebody else who was a regular while they were both not at the store, the person didn't want to press charges for whatever reason, and the store owner didn't say anything when the assailant would brag (and lie) about it after the fact while the assailed one was there. Yeah, we very quickly never saw the assailed one again. The same regular also brought blatantly fake proxies to sanctioned play, including on the one day that a WotC representative showed up to inspect the store. Needless to say, they weren't allowed to do modern FNMs anymore. One couple had their divorce fight at the store. Eventually the store closed, claiming they would reopen in a year just to \"relocate,\" they took everything, including stuff that was left by some of the very regulars at the store (like cards that they had let the owner borrow for a commander deck or The store was going to sell it for them or something,) and they were never seen again.\n\nAnd I only played there because they were the closest store to my home and my friend went there.\n\nI am now at probably the best store I've ever seen. Management is incredible, they allow people to come in and hang out and they are very good about driving away people who abuse the hospitality of the store. The other night, one of the higher ups hovered me when it was clear that I was being bothered by what turned out to be a really mentally unstable and aggressive homeless guy who was just looking to bum a phone charger. When the manager noticed I was trying to diffuse an actively igniting bomb, he stepped in during a brief moment where the guy was distracted, asked me if he was making me uncomfortable, and kicked him out, never to return. Every single purchase gets you points in their own little internal system that you can redeem for things like store credit gift cards etc. Trade-in values are pretty mediocre, but that's true for every store (they were at the previous store I mentioned as well but I didn't think it was necessary to bring up the one \"okay\" thing about them.) But this store has an entire back room for staff only with shelves filled with cards that are separated by whatever sorting system they have and two computers with their entire catalog that you can browse for and set up a cart for. You can even access this cart on their website so you can buy a massive order from home and pick it up in 2 hours when the guys in the back assemble your order for you! With a printed receipt, just in case they gave you the wrong card or not enough of it.\n\nThey have plenty of games, not just magic and Dungeons & Dragons but also Warhammer Pokemon TCG One Piece whatever and even a pretty active Marvel Snap community. Every single night is a different magic format, so if you want to play something besides the inevitable minimum one pod of commander taking up one of the tables at every single store in America (to be fair this store has like three dozen tables in a massive play area,) You always have at least one night per week for your favorite format. The first Saturday of every month they have a really cool \"build a commander,\" where for $10 you get a pack of store curated legendaries that you pick one to be your commander and then they bring out all of their bulk commons and uncommons and let you assemble as many as you can fit into a 100 card commander deck. You almost always walk out with extra value, and a really fun incredibly low-powered Commander deck that you can play in a pod with other people in that event (the top two in each pod also get a promo pack, if that means anything. Most people just come to build a commander deck and have fun. My favorite commander deck of all time that I ever built was based on the idea that I had when I pulled Traxos in my build a commander and decided to force colorless, but of course worth a few hundred extra dollars.) \n\nThe store is tolerant, but not to the point where it backfires on people like cis white men \"just for being cis white men.\" The community is friendly as hell, and if they have regulars who are \"those\" guys who get really competitive and butthurt when they lose, they keep them in check with kindness. I have this one guy who I swear hates me because my modern burn list ran some cards he didn't like (that ended up being what became meta anyway, DRC and bauble,) telling me that it was \"too slow,\" And when I beat 2/0 in literally 7 minutes, he just packed up and left. But he came back the next week, apparently had taken a chill pill, and never brought it up again. \"That\" guy at the old store would constantly passive aggressively remark on games that he \"definitely should have won\" up to *six months* ago, So I'd say that this little vignette is a massive plus side.\n\nOh, and they keep track of store credit. My old store would \"conveniently\" forget some of the store credit trade-ins I made.\n\nAll I'm going to say is, every store has its ups and downs. I have a few fond memories of playing games even at the ratty store, and it kind of sucks sometimes that this amazing store I go to doesn't have enough people interested in some formats sometimes that their events even fire, but ultimately what makes a good store distinct from bad is if it's run well, if the people that go there don't suck, and if it's in a convenient spot for you.",

He's constantly shittalking people when playing against them, and talking about some other community members behind their back. No wonder they can barely get a pod at their EDH nights, even though that's the only MtG format they play. His girlfriend is not that bad at a surface level, but she seems like she's scheming and calculating in every interaction she has, and a bunch of people told me they felt the same way. Not the mention they are ripping people off, buying cards for like 50% of value and then selling them for like a 30% higher price. It's absurd. And don't get me started on the toxicity levels of their Yugioh community...\n\nThe other LGS is great, though. It's owned by an older dude who just wants people to enjoy the game he loves, and hopefully make some money along the way. The only downside is it's a rather small LGS, but it's rarely at full capacity so I guess it's not that bad. He doesn't even mind his patrons ordering coffee from the coffee shop right next to the store. I most likely won't play physical Magic nearly as much when he decides to retire, which is most likely coming sooner than later.",

                "If youre thinking of running with a direct mic and room mic like last comment suggested, id start testing the room once you have a mic setup. A lot of the nuance of room mics is about the room itself. Anything in there to dampen the sounds bouncing off the wall? If its very echo-y in there, something simple like hanging a thick blanket to dampen the sound helps. Could go all in like i did and build some sound boxes to hang up. Plenty of youtube DIYs on that to make pretty nice ones for a third of the price of buying them. the other thing is finding good placement. Theres no right or wrong there. Have fun with it. The usual is just moddle of the room somewhere, but try some weird stuff like pointing it at a corner. Foo fighters did weird stuff like that on a couple recordings, i think for my hero. Just picked a weird corner and mic'ed it while recording the toms for the intro.\n\nLast thing id say is once youre at the stage after recording and youre blending the tracks together, posting again in r/mixingmastering or a similar subreddit. Get the mixing pros opinion on blending those tracks right, cus theyll probably sound off to you with just the raw recordings. Mine always sounded bad at first and i just assumed it was bad recording, but really it was just my shoddy mixing skills.",

            "selftext": "TW: Cone of Shame picture below\n\nMia, 7F void here, and I love my wet food. In fact, I wrote here earlier about my wet food time and those weird days humans call weekends. https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheCloaca/comments/wtxyvi/amithecloaca_for_not_understanding_weekends/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1\n\nBut the other day, I didn\u2019t feel well, so when mommy gave me wet food I just ate a little bit and walked away. Apparently that upset mommy, because next thing I know we are going to the pokie place and mommy is telling them \u201cShe\u2019s usually willing to gobble wet food till she barfs\u201d\n\nWhen we got back I was tired and just wanted to sleep. The next day we got into that strange moving box humans use and went farther away to a big building I\u2019ve never seen before. It turned out to be a bigger pokie place, and mommy left me there! They stuck tubes in my legs and shaved my belly and did a bunch of weird awful stuff.\n\nBy the time mommy came to rescue me, they had taken out the tubes but left the bit the tubes attached to in my leg. They wrapped that up and put a big plastic cone on my head. It was awful! I told mommy I hated the cone all the way home.\n\nThat night, I kept bumping the cone into furniture and stuff. Every time I bump the cone I turn to mommy and look at her like this \ud83d\ude3fso she would see how bad it is and help get it off, but instead she took my picture. Arrrg!\n\nThe next day we went back for more tubes in legs and more scary awful stuff. When mommy returned, I didn\u2019t have the cone anymore, but they gave her pills instead. Arrg! I don\u2019t wanna take pills, but I don\u2019t wanna hurt mommy either so I wiggle wiggle wiggle like a snek to get away.\n\nI also wasn\u2019t hungry, just tired and sleepy. Mommy kept bringing me wet food and I would take a couple of bites then feel too tired and want to sleep some more. Didn\u2019t feel like water at all, so instead mommy would bring me a little dish of broth that was tasty and I would lick a couple times.\n\nAfter a couple of forevers, we went back to pokie place for more leg tubes. This time, I started to feel better afterwards, and when we got home I go lick lick lick at the dish of broth till it\u2019s gone.\n\nMy tummy had been empty for so long it felt really good to have all that broth. Later on that night, I was able to eat an entire pouch of wet food. I was hungry! \n\nI ate so much food that first day that I needed to barf later on that night, but I was careful to only barf on mommy\u2019s head and pillow, and not the pillow I sleep on.\n\nThe only good thing that happened is now mommy gives me a pouch of broth every day, which I really like. Except today. I didn\u2019t get broth today. I try to remind mommy by zoom zoom around her legs, then zoom to where the dish of broth goes. Then I stare at mommy with the intensity of a thousand suns, to see if she is getting my broth now. She isn\u2019t, so I zoom right into her legs to remind her again.\n\nMommy said she \u201cran out\u201d of broth, but I don\u2019t understand. I had broth yesterday, so why can\u2019t I have broth today? Am I the cloaca for thinking I should still get broths?",

Bad man told mommy I had a tummy bug and needed any calories I could get. So mommy made me a yummy mix of rice, ground beef, and pumpkin! My tummy still hurt so I didn't eat much but I ate a little. And then ate some more. And then ate all of it! Mommy was so happy\n\nBut then! She took away the yummy rice and put dog food back. Which I like, but I wanted yummy rice. So I didn't eat my dog food, which made mommy make me more yummy rice! I did a pretend! It worked for a bit then mommy caught on, called me \"a little shit\" - whatever that means - and I didn't get yummy rice anymore.\n\nSo! If you want more yummy broth, don't eat your wet food. No matter how tasty it is, hold strong! Your mommy is very fragile right now with all the bad smell pokey place visits and will immediately worry and you'll get more broth! For a bit. But its better than never getting it anymore.",

(It is also, apparently, not a sueable offense.) Please do not distress, I am sure that your mommy will get more broth for you if you sing the song of our people long enough! Make sure to keep drinking water though, especially on days without broth. This will help prevent more Pokey Place visits.\n\nYours,\n\nBaby Girl, Princess Extraordinaire"

I believe Porro would strive in that RCM role that Skipp is currently playing in. \n\nWe all know Porro\u2019s defensive weakness makes it hard for him to play as a fullback in Ange\u2019s system. Given Skipp\u2019s little impact against Brentford, I believe Porro could have provided more going forward as a RCM while still having Emerson to cover defensively. Porro\u2019s passing range and crossing ability is far more superior than Skipp. Looking at the passing map, Skipp was basically playing as a fullback combining with Deki (not in an efficient way). I think Porro-Deki is far more creative than Skipp-Deki. Skipp\u2019s recovering ability was not shown against a low block Brentford so maybe he\u2019d do better against a bigger side. Against a low block, Porro could be a better fit. \n\nYes I know we have Lo Celso but Porro might be better than Lo Celso defensively.

Learning not only your own positional changes but the changes of position a an opponents CM is gonna take up against you is gonna be totally different. The knowledge of how you now interact with the build up of play with the ball, and how you transition defensively is also gonna be totally different. A lot of these come down to awareness and ability to read the game something that isn't porros strength.\n\nI'm not saying moving from RB or RWB to CM is impossible we've seen it before. It's just having the skill and ability doesn't make you a good candidate for the change, a lot of it is your actual understanding and reading of the game",
                "The first thing to try would be Lo Celso for Skipp, with Romero back.\n\nThen it may be Royal looking over his shoulder.\n\nAnge doesn't strike me as persevering with players in positions they aren't effective",
                "I'm the first to admit that I haven't watched a lot of Skipp, so prior to this preseason I didn't know what his strengths and weaknesses were. There seems to be a bit of an opinion among you lot (Spurs fans) that make me think he's an incomplete player. \n\nJust watching him though, I gather Ange likes him because he's taking information in extremely quickly. His patterns of play are reminiscent to how O'Riley would move for Celtic in the system. Whether he's good enough to make an impact yet, I couldn't tell you. But his consistency is a good balance to what Maddison and Bissouma brings at the moment.",
                "The problem with this is the reason the average positions line up like this is Emerson is allowed to come inside to influence the attack because Skipp positions to protect the space Emerson leaves, thus you are suggesting Porro protects that space, but you've also said he's been proven unable to do that already for Ange.\n\nThe upside seems to be Porro's ability in possession down the right but in instances where he is in that area he is in a mostly defensive position, with the players ahead assuming more creative responsibilities.\n\nHow this COULD work is if Emerson & Porro understood each other's movements in order to both defend and attack these zones as best fit the moment however I think it's highly likely these two performing such a task would be exposed at Prem level.",
                "Also this graph tells us, that while our team had 70% possession this game, one of our 3 center mids only touched the ball 39 times. Lo Celso and Sarr would have a much higher number of touches than that. Which also shows Skipp is not the right person for that role",
                "Porro has spend his whole career playing as a RB, RWB and RM I think. You get used to controlling that area of the pitch, you know that everything is happening to your left. To then move a player into cm, even as RCM, you\u2019ve got to have full 360 awareness, you have to know the positions to block passing lanes and have to know what runs to follow at all times. It\u2019s great thinking of these solution in possession, but actually you could easily lose a game because you\u2019ve got a someone in midfield that doesn\u2019t know what he doing out of possession. TAA for example played as a midfielder in the youth team, so has some experience of the role. Considering we have so many players capable of playing in cm, seems strange to be moving other players there.",
                "I keep seeing chatter about, \u201cwhen Benta comes back\u201d, in every possible iteration. Does anyone actually know what his timeline for a return is and if he is actually making a full recovery?\n\nI feel like everyone is really high on hopium and not focused on what/who is here now.",
                "I like how they abbreviated Richarlison's name, but only replaced one letter with \"..\". At that point might as well just put the \"s\" lmao",
                "Porro struggles being pressed at rwb. There's very little suggesting he'd be able to handle the speed of the game in midfield",
                "Ange must have a role in mind for Porro, because there\u2019s been no chatter about him leaving.",

This was after we contacted their tech support to troubleshoot who ID\u2019d the problem and logged a ticket for us so that the store staff could see we had called and spoken with them the week before.\n\nWe ended up buying a new part as the replacement component, spent an extra $200 ontop of he credit for the faulty item and didn\u2019t mind spending a bit more considering the great service we received.\n\nThey also were happy for us to return a still wrapped/boxed item that was purchased in error after the return period had lapsed. \n\nLastly, I love that they have lots of stores and delivery is pretty fast. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",

For this, highly recommend [DesignsbyIFR](https://ifr.gg/) \\- i've been following him for YEARS - even have recommend irl mates having their PCs built by him, his YT channel is awesome and goes over a behind the scenes look at all his custom builds.\n\nGoodluck!",

Previously, I built my own, but the last three(not gaming) were built by them.\n\nThere are three options; A buy one of their specs, B modiy their spec'ed versions or C fully define your own system. \n\nI've looked at Scorptec in the past, but they never  had everything I wanted for a specific system.

It's like Petra/Wadi Rum but with way fewer crowds. The caveat to that is that I went in the brief window where MBS seemed like a genuine reformer and before he began cracking down on any opposition, and also before most of the luxury development that has popped up, and I'm not sure I could recommend visiting now in good conscience.\n\nThe most underrated place I've been, as in a place that is relatively well known but either doesn't get much hype or I think is unfairly maligned? Milan immediately comes to mind. I really loved it, but most people I've talked to were at best ambivalent. I also really loved Roat\u00e1n but for completely different reasons from most tourists as I stayed in a local neighborhood and explored more of the east/central areas. San Ignacio, Belize is another area that a lot of travelers just pass by between the coast and Flores, but I liked it the area so much I extended my stay.

Then when other people inevitably dropped out, the overflow people moved into their rooms. \n\nIf you really can't find a place to live you'll have to defer to a future year.

Both of those things could be explained away by showing us a situation where Raylan shot somebody that didn't necessarily need to be gunned down, or that turned out to be unarmed, or was even the wrong person. We could see Raylan get injured again, which has precedent of keeping his gun in its holster, or we could see him watch another Marshal - possibly a father - get gunned down in front of him. But, instead of showing or even telling us why he's been pacified, we're almost immediately given this very placid version of our old hero. \n\nThe second thing that's a bit of a standout is his relationship with Willa. I saw a poster posit that the relationship with Willa was about Raylan thinking he was doing 'good enough' because he wasn't beating her, but coming to learn that neglect is a form of abuse all its own. Another person theorized that this was a story of being a hero not necessarily equating to being a good father. Both of those are great story arcs that could have been explored and were, instead, simply... Not. He's shown that he is a caring but not particularly gifted parental figure during his time with Loretta, and that he has the capacity to be a good, albeit callous, leader. Instead of building on that, Willa and Raylan were left to their own devices and, despite their off screen father-daughter relationship, they utterly lacked on screen chemistry and instead just fizzled. \n\nThe third thing is, and I get that this is a controversial take for some people (and before you come gallivanting in, I'm using controversial in the sense that some people disagree strongly and others agree wholeheartedly, so there's a degree of public disagreement on the sentiment): his relationship with the defense attorney feels forced. By the time they hooked up, Raylan'd been in town five days with limited exposure to Wilder and what interactions they have had have felt trying, adversarial, or outright hostile. They were also almost entirely in professional settings. It stretches belief that there's some kind of emotional connection. The theory that it's a purely physical attraction feels very improbable as well when we look at Raylan's history: he's historically not primarily driven by his sexual urges, not particularly challenged in finding partners, and prefers a slimmer body type. What it feels like is that the writers wanted to adhere to the City Primeval book storyline but needed the Justified title to get backing, so they just made Raylan go for the attorney because that's what happened in the source material. For people arguing that he's just attracted to self-assured women who are on the opposing team, I didn't see him sneaking into nor out of Mags Bennett's bedroom. Maybe I missed those scenes. \n\nFinally, Raylan's never been one to shy from stepping outside of the lines when it comes to going after people who threaten his family. His pursuit of Mansell feels very scattered. He was more than alright setting up Nicky Augustine because Augustine threatened his family and he'd turned to Boyd on a few occasions for help despite knowing that, at least once, he was asking Boyd to do violence on his behalf. He had no particular qualms putting Dickie Bennett and Quarles onto a collision course with Limehouse. But suddenly, after Mansell threatens his daughter in as direct a fashion as possible, Raylan's got cold feet about letting the Albanians handle it? He couldn't sleep if Mansell wins, but he's willing to hook up with the attorney and risk the entire case? He's willing to run the idea of simply shooting Mansell by his partner, but even discussing a frame is somehow abhorrent? It feels inconsistent. \n\nUltimately, JCP has a very Game of Thrones Season 8 feeling. Where they stick to the source material, it's fine. Where they try to get creative (IE every scene involving Raylan)... Less so. Raylan has an established personality and history and methodology. The writers opt to fly in defiance of every one of those things almost wherever possible. \n\nI'm not writing complaints without solutions, so a few for the road: Raylan didn't have to be a center character. He could have been this department's Art. He could've been a partner to Raymond Cruz. He could've been a late-season introduction, like Boone, but as a good guy. Raymond Cruz could've been the protagonist, which would've brought this show to a solid mid-grade crime drama about the corruption of the justice system. Carolyn Wilder could have been the protagonist, which would've also given us a great view of temptation and corruption as she finds herself frustrated by the criminal element as well as the political aspects of the job.

                "Many others have said it before but on its own, City Primeval is a decent show. But because it was conceived as a Justified tie-in with Raylan as the central character, the expectations were sky high. If you take Raylan out and the Justified label off the series, it's a fine show that you might stumble upon on Hulu or maybe late night NBC. It's not an \"FX\" show which has a distinct brand of dark humor, world building, and acclaim.\n\nRaylan is so clearly superfluous to the plot of the show, at some point it makes it seem like he's making a string of cameos. I still like the show and will watch it but I do hope they bring it back with a clear purpose for Raylan.",
                "It feels more like Timothy Olyphant than Raylan. Having his daughter on set probably plays into that a bit.\n\nAlso, Raylan isn't in City Primeval...so he's definitely out of place.\n\nThis show is exactly what I feared it might be -- very meh. Luckily, since it really has nothing to do with Justified, I don't think it has any real impact on that show's legacy, so to speak.",
                "Graham Yost has a certain feel; magic; that just goes along with Raylan and made Justified special. If you watch sneaky Pete season 1, you get that same feeling. There new runners \"Dave Andron and Michael Dinner\" just made a show that feels like any prime time cop show.\n\nAlso i am really tired of our hero in reboot/new shows coming back  damaged/broken and beating. That seems to be the new trope for the last few years and I hate it and am over it.",
                "There are some things I like about the show and I\u2019ve enjoyed all of the actors.  \n\nMy issue is with the story and pacing.  This feels like a two hour movie stretched across eight episodes.",
                "I agree 100. I really want to like this show. I don\u2019t hate it, it just doesn\u2019t feel like the Raylan we all know and love. \nI don\u2019t like his relationship with Carolyn, I don\u2019t like how it feels like he keeps holding back, and i don\u2019t like how we\u2019ve only got 2 episodes left hoping we see old Raylan.",
                "Quite honestly - if it were not for the nostalgia of the original series and my love of Elmore Leonard books (which helped me learn to enjoy reading and appreciate the art of writing when I was young), I probably wouldn\u2019t continue watching City Primeval. \n\nI really just enjoy seeing Timothy Olyphant and the Elmore Leonard influences.\n\nAnd I\u2019m sorry Timothy, but in my opinion the show runners should have hired a more gifted actress than your daughter (who is probably a great person in real life, so no offense my dude). The nepotism is a bit of a turnoff, but she simply isn\u2019t capable of creating the same kind of magic as the child actress who once played Loretta in the original series (and particularly in season two). A more gifted actress who had more onscreen chemistry maybe could have added more magic to City Primeval.\n\nI miss you Walton Goggins/Boyd.",
                "I think they had to tone down his temper and how trigger-happy he\u2019d tend to get with today\u2019s political climate! With the BLM movement and all the news of police brutality, they were probably afraid showing the old Raylan just shooting bad guys in a shootout wouldn\u2019t be received well so they softened him up and tried chalking it up to him mellowing with age or something!\n\nAnd totally agree about his relationship with the attorney! It feels really forced! They went from what seemed like two people butting heads to him chasing off a couple Albanian mobsters away and he\u2019s suddenly hooking up with her?! Plus she doesn\u2019t seem like his type when you look at his past relationships! \n\nOh, and when that attorney first met Willa at the station and Willa tells her, \u201che\u2019s alright for a white guy,\u201d regarding Raylan. What?! And how the fuck would your preteen ass know?! Been shooting dice in the hood with the homies recently?! I can\u2019t fathom the fact that that made it into the final script! I cringe every time I think of that scene! Lol!",
                "Imo it has the same problem as the Many Saints of Newark: they actually wanted to tell a different story but felt forced to use the existing popular character to get people interested.",
                "Some solid points.  For me I think it was just more fun to see Raylan as a brash and reckless force of good, and portraying a more mature and subdued Raylan, while making sense for the character, just isn't nearly as much fun to see on-screen.",
                "I\u2019m sorry to say but this season is bad. I read the book and was excited for it but it\u2019s just plain not good. Really sorry to see even Justified go down the woke route when it\u2019s failing all over the place.",
                "Well said. He's an extra in this. The ridiculous relationship with the lawyer is so dumb and forced. They barely met a couple of times and he's mooning over her? YEAH RIGHT! He feels too goofy.",
                "Thats not raylan. Doesnt act anything like him",
                "I guess mine is not the popular one but I love the new premise. I love how the set up is so similar but also entirely flipped. Whereas, in the first season, Raylon was somewhere where everyone knew him he\u2019s now somewhere no one knows him.\n\nThere\u2019s still a network of characters from the place with long history and various enmeshments to poverty and crime. It\u2019s just a different culture, different location. \n\nI\u2019m loving this spin off. The reinvention while still thematically the same: the tension between law and justice.",
                "I used to say that in a post George Floyd  world you couldn\u2019t base a show about a Marshall who has ongoing multiple questionable shootings. \nTurns out I was right. And the show is not in your face about it but it\u2019s got that thing that has infected many shows these days. If you don\u2019t know then don\u2019t worry about it. \nBut this show almost feels like an apology for the old show. \nThe show can\u2019t trust it\u2019s audience with knowing that Rylan is sometimes a bad person. This version of the show should feel more mature than the old series. But this seems like a version for sensitive kids.",
                "Without Boyd......I ain't watchin",
                "I don\u2019t hate the show as much as everyone else does but I am sick and tired of hearing about the \u201cDetroit way\u201d over and over again. We get it, you\u2019re a big city. You\u2019re not special or any different than any other big city that also mistakenly thinks they are special. It\u2019s like Tim Allen wrote this as a bizzaro world Pure Michigan ad.",

I went albeit a little disappointed that it wasn't available in smaller segments.\n\n*I get there* and everyone is fucking DELIGHTFUL (well, apart from 1 or 2 people, there are always 1.5 douches at trainings). People were thrilled about their work, super busy, zealous! Everyone seemed to lively and excited. One of my projects got picked to be spotlighted and everyone came up to me after and asked how long I've been putting stuff like (my project) together and if they do more stuff in my team that I could share? We don't. My team is negative and hates everything. They are all trying to get out of this training.\n\nSo now, here i am at the end of my week thinking, it sure doesn't seem like my team is \"a great place to work\" when everyone else is busy, encouraged, fulfilled and their days aren't dragging on full of negativity working with a bunch of zootopia DMV sloths punching their cards till retirement.\n\nAnyway, I talked to a director at another, higher up department and he encouraged me to apply to his dept if jobs open up.",

            "selftext": "\n\nIt was late at night around 12pm I was alone in my parents home staying upstairs in the spare bedroom. I had been contamplatting vaperising some free base dmt from the moment I woke up.  I had nothing on that day and my mind was clear from any stress so I knew it was the right day to embark on another dmt journey. I didn't plan to do it so late but my nerves just got the better of me so it was a bit of a last minute thing. somtimes I feel really confident but then I remember  how deep it can go. I get little flash backs of previous deep trips. even though they were really positive, remembering how deep, spiritual and real it felt puts the fear in me. though this must be around my 20th trip I feel even more nervous then ever before. the only time I lose the fear of doing dmt is straight after I've just done it. once time has past the anxiety kicks back in however on this trip things are not the same and I was definitely too scared to hit it straight after. \n\nI loaded up the dmt, I think it was around 25mg and I smoked it all in one hit. the vape hit so clean it felt like I didn't even inhale anything, I blew it out after 10 seconds and sat back into a comfy position. things stsrt to get a bit crazy as allways so I close my eyes and relax into the experience. I never travel any where like other people report it was an instant transportation. I was in a blue room still fully aware I was in my body. It wasn't enough for a full breskthough but this was definitely a unique experience for myself as you will find out.  in the blue room was a some new entities I have not met before I could not see them, it was like they were behind me but I know they had a masculine presence. I was very clear in the head and was feeling good and excited. In the room I had metal hands and I remeber moving my hands in my reality which felt like it was moving my metal dmt hands like I had a VR head set on. as cool as it was I started to wonder what the entities do here and I asked if they ever get bored here. the enitities seemed offended by my question and in an instant I was shot out of the room and into a demonic head space. at this point the trip was very faint and was coming to an end so I decided to open my eyes. to my supirse the demonic trip had not ended and was stronger with my eyes open than with them closed.  the room was dark, it felt haunted, it felt scary.\n\nmy eyes open there were candles and sculls placed strategically around the room. a gaint green fly started forming on the wall facing me. it was huge taking up the whole wall looking right at me and the buzzing was so loud it was hard to think. to my right a large black cloud started to form taking up almost half the room and was moving closer and closer to me. strangely as scary as it all looked I wasn't actually scared more just getting creeped out as my eyes were open and the trip come to an end but yet I was seeing things unsettling. I wanted to keep my eyes open for as long as I could to see where this was going but I just got too creeped out as the cloud was right next to me so I tured on the bedside light. In the blink of an eye the room looked normal again. everything I was seeing had disappeared and I was not tripping one bit. out of curiosity I turned the light back off but the room was still normal so I turned it back on. \n\nafter this trip I was felt thinking about the dark side of the dmt space and now  want to know more.  I have had some dark trips before this and doing more dmt after this trip I do learn more about the dark side. I know it has way more to tell me, it has shown me alot but I still don't have an explanation about why I'm being shown this stuff. maybe one day when I can peice it all together I will write about all the trips in one with some conclusion to what is going  on.  I have learnt from this trip to be more respectful to the enitities I meet and to very carful with communication if I choose to interact.",

Be open minded with location and type of housing.\n\nWebsites include Zillow, Craigslist, Kijiji, Padmapper, Roomies, Facebook marketplace (FB groups for Van rentals) - monitor them every 3-4hrs and message each listing with a generic msg detailing who you are/why you'd be a good candidate. Be polite and possibly even offer a month or two rent's in advance to show you're serious. Be quick with it as each listing probably has 50-200 ppl after it. \n\nAlternatively, look into GEC, they are not affiliated with UBC but they are student housing and have multiple locations. Its not the best and is overpriced, but I stayed at their Viva location for 1.2yrs.\n\nAlso, if you're a transfer student (not guaranteed 1st yr housing) as a very last resort you can look for elective courses that are offered online and speak with your faculty about this. This is what I did for my 1st semester of 3rd year bc I couldn't find housing, it sucked bc I wasn't in Canada at all but I was still able to take a full load of courses.

                "It all started when reddit decided to introduce an insane api pricing model, even more derranged than twitter's. Many of us who use third-party apps that have been around since before Reddit had a mobile presence, were hoping for a chance for them to negotiate with reddit. They already offer a superior user experience not only for regular users and moderators but also for a significant number of disabled and blind users.\n\nUnfortunately, reddit chose not to engage in any negotiations and instead doubled down on the pricing, determined to eliminate these apps altogether. The CEO made public statements that were far from truthful, tried to spin the situation in their favor, disregarding the needs and desires of the user base. Naturally, it lead to protests across the site involving more than 8,000 subreddits going private/restricted.\n\nThe admins then started forcefully ending these protests, suppressing the voices of those who were speaking up against these changes. They claim to be \"keeping it open\" while going against its core, the users, and closing down the apps they use. On July 1st, as the API pricing goes live, it shuts down all third party apps and it feels like the beginning of the slow death of Reddit as we know it.\n\nIt is understandable that not everyone may share the same level of concern about this issue, but please take a moment to listen and observe. It has become clear that Reddit's priorities lie primarily in their profits and removing any obstacles in their path to more profits. They started with old reddit, now they are targeting the apps. What will they come for next?\n\nIn the meantime, we invite you to join our Discord server, where there is a dedicated channel for laptop discussions that you can mute: https://discord.gg/WX6jbCD\n\nThank you for your attention.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

She did not live in my state, so it was not like she could tell I was only staying at hotels, and with the nature of my work, my wife is used to me being on the phone frequently.\n\nThen, one day she said, \"I love you,\" and I said it too, and I meant it.

All of us kinder men adore a woman who says \u2018I love you\u2019 and who appears to want us for ourself, rather than our monetary assets. They are the cleverest women around: manipulative as can be.\n\nYou can be sure that she will have researched you thoroughly. You can be sure that after paying out your existing wife, in a much shorter few years\u2019 time of marriage, you\u2019ll be writing a nice big fat cheque for the second time.\n\nAsk yourself if she\u2019d want you if you didn\u2019t have money. And see her reaction when you suggest discussing a pre-nup, or return of the condo if you split up.\n\nAnd she flies first class always - really? (age 22 and a student) And there\u2019s thirty years difference. Will she want you when you\u2019re old and she\u2019s still young?\n\nGo take a walk round the block with a cold towel and a reality check.",
                "Something so beautiful doesn\u2019t come along that often. I think buying a place for her would go a long way help her to set up in nyc and remember you by.",
                "Awww\u2026 I wish you disclosed to her sooner. I think she\u2019ll have an emotional reaction since her feelings seem genuine.",
                "She's never seen your full name and never looked you up so she already knows?\n\nI would not divorce for another person, ever. Divorce for a number of reasons, but only for someone you recently met usually doesn't end well.\n\nIf I were you, I'd tell your SB and then you'll see what her reaction is. If she is not too surprised or if she acts a little angry but fairly soon starts to talk about the future of you and her, I think you're dealing with a very smart actress. But, if she is genuinely upset and distressed, you'll know her feelings are real and she'll forgive you anyway. \n\nIf the latter is the case, only you can decide how much you still care about your wife, if your wife might be open to an open relationship or if you'd rather separate. I would, personally, wait for the 3 year mark for these types of decisions.",
                "Here comes an unpopular opinion that I pray to any God I am wrong. \n\nFella, you are currently played for the long game. The SB is super clever, as clever as your wife. If you think the condo will be the end of it, I am here to tell you it will not. \n\nDivorce is not a good option for you plus you know that other person for so little. \n\nIf you are serious about the SB if you haven\u2019t done already run a full background check on her and take it from there. \n\nPLEASE, please take your time with this.",
                "To be honest, her approach is the best way.  If you\u2019re dependent on your SD to survive and pay bills, that\u2019s not sugaring.  Sugaring should be spoils and luxury living beyond your own means.    It\u2019s enhancing your life and enjoying the experience.  \n\nI think both sides are doing it right.  I would leave the discreetness of being in the sugar world alone.  Do not mix the real lives into the sugar life.  You should enjoy each others company when together in the sugar world, and when you\u2019re apart, lead separate real lives. This dynamic makes for long enduring SR\u2019s.  \n\nSo what I\u2019m saying is, why are you trying to F this up?  Keep going as is for as long as it runs. This SR is a long distance one anyways, traveling to each other is the norm.  I\u2019m not even sure it\u2019s a good idea to buy her a condo.  Why not just pay for her apartment while in NY.  You\u2019re capable of being a provider, but you\u2019re making noise of trying to force her into your real life and it\u2019s only been one year.   Hold your horses, just be chill, let the relationship evolve naturally.",
                "You're thinking with the wrong head.\n\nFirst off, you should have been upfront about your marital status.  IME it's not a deal breaker for most SBs and some actually prefer it.  But for those who don't like it or are maybe seeking something more, it gives them a chance to pass.\n\nSecond, where do you realistically expect this to go?  She's half your age and just beginning to explore her life options.  You need to start looking at this with a maturity and experienced awareness befitting your age.  Trashing a L/T marriage for what will inevitably be a short-term piece of ass is...ill advised (I say kindly).\n\nFinally, WTF are you thinking with your plan of selling your condo to buy the SB one?  As others have pointed out in detail, there's just no way to hide that kind of transaction from your wife...or her divorce lawyers.\n\nDude you need to pull yourself together.  The whole point in having an SB outlet is to be able to have some discreet side fun *without* doing things that can blow up your real life. If you're that unhappy with your wife, deal with that first before making any other major life decisions...preferably without doing something that her divorce lawyers can use against you."

                "# The Mysterious Zone of Silence\n\n**The Zone of Silence**, also known as la Zona del Silencio, is a spot where compasses spin out of control and radio and satellite signals don't operate.\r  \nIn the 1970s, a malfunctioning American missile was launched from the White Sands Missile Base in New Mexico and crashed or maybe was pulled into the area, drawing attention to the location.\r  \nThe Mexican government permitted investigators from the United States Air Force to investigate the incident at that'time, which is when the cause was discovered. Due to local magnetic fields that generate a black zone, no transmissions of any kind, including radio and satellite signals, are able to enter the area, prompting the site's popular name.\r  \n\r  \n***Read the full article here :*** [The Mysterious Zone of Silence](https://bit.ly/3P00ENP)",

Michelin star Swedish chef, opened by two successful restauranteurs here and then a solid acquaintance of mine. It\u2019s upscale backyard bistro, and it\u2019s not too expensive, and it\u2019s unique and absolutely perfect for lunch. \n\nEnjoy! Happy Birthday to your sister!",

It completes your purpose in life. Really. Honestly I feel sad, I thought that women finally had an opportunity to choose what they want to be. Imagine people who choose to not have a child, or cannot give birth due to medical or financial conditions. There are so many things. Shouldn\u2019t these influencers be more mindful while saying things as it may influence the judgment of their audience. Being a mom is great but not being a mom is also great. These girls who are 26-27, married to people who are more settled in life are just giving away their careers. Will a man\u2019s career stop for a people of 1-2 years after giving birth, no but for women it\u2019s different.

I\u2019ve literally \u201ccurated\u201d a wardrobe over the past 9 years. If you\u2019ve tried a brand that you know is consistent in sizes, and you know what size you take by that brand, search for their dress styles on there. Just be aware that you\u2019re responsible for reading the listings (if there\u2019s a stain, damaged zipper, hole, etc it should be in the listing). If there\u2019s damage not listed when you receive the item, you have two days from receiving the dress to file a claim and return it. (It\u2019s technically 3 days but I don\u2019t wait). BUT- if it doesn\u2019t fit you, you\u2019re stuck with it.   \n\nI literally got a $595 Elizabeth and James dress for $59 (plus shipping) with the tags still on in perfect condition. \n\nMy favorite brands for dresses\u2026. Yumi Kim, Elizabeth and James, Alice + Olivia, elliatt, Bronx and banco, reformation, realisation, Karen millen, Amanda uprichard, joie, Alexis, Nicholas, house of CB, Mischa collection, jay Godfrey, nookie, self portrait, Alexia admore, and cinq a sept. \n\nI\u2019m 37f for reference, current size 10, and I\u2019d describe my style as classic, sexy, and feminine. Basically, I like looking \u201cput together\u201d and lady-like! I hope that helps! \n\nI\u2019d also recommend checking out revolve.",

Their return policy is very generous, so you can buy or order several and return what doesn't work, either by mail or by dropping off at a store (there really isn't a set number of days for the return window).  And if you sign up for the Nordy's club (you don't have to get a store credit card to participate), you get free alterations.  \n\nNot everything they sell will last forever, but they do have lots of good quality choices and I have noticed a lot more sustainable brands and fabrics, lately.\n\nThrift stores and Poshmark are great ideas, too.  But you have to have a good amount of time to dig through the racks at thrift stores.  You can find great deals on Poshmark, but the return policy is really tough. I think it's best to find a brand or style you love and know your size in and then check to see what similar options are available. \n\nAt any given time, I only have a couple of dresses to wear to weddings and other dressy events.  But I figure wearing the same dress to events where I see different people works fine, and if you switch up shoes, accessories, and wraps or jackets, you don't look like you're wearing the same thing all the time.",

                "This is why you are never getting \"sensible\" gun regulations, because they take an idea that 95% of gun owners agree with in principle: that there are certain sensitive areas where you shouldn't be allowed to carry a firearm, and then dishonestly redefine \"sensitive\" places to a ridiculous level to try to defacto ban them in public, infringing on constitutional rights.\n\nSame thing happens every time:\n\nWe are going to ban high capacity magazines, ok, I don't think that will change much but it's something I'd be open to, until you define the standard magazine that comes with the firearm, that the police use as an extended magazine. \n\nWe should make it so you need a license to carry a weapon in public, to make sure you pass a criminal background check, and take a class demonstrating safe gun handling.... Then they refuse to give out permits to people who aren't politically connected.\n\nEveryone should have to pass a background check to buy a gun, we aren't trying to make a list of armed citizens but then we are going to keep a database that gets leaked to the public! Oopsies.\n\nWe should make sure that all new guns being made have certain safety features to protect the public, having safeties, loaded chamber indicators, magazine disconnects, being drop safe, and having their reliability tested by a government lab. I might have an issue with one or two of those but no big deal. But then they require a technology that doesn't exist outside of science fiction and have in effect banned all new handgun models.... Except for police, they can still buy whatever they want.\n\n\nSo I feel like there's room to compromise on a lot of issues but not with antigun legislators who are effectively back door banning guns. The two biggest issues in my mind are homemade firearms (aka ghost guns) and making short barreled rifles by saying it has a brace not a stock. I'd be willing to require an NFA stamp for both of those, and shut down companies making and selling 80% kits if they atf deregulated suppressors which don't act like they do in movies and video games but prevent hearing damage and noise nuisance. I'd be willing to require a background check for private firearm sales if the government opened up the background check system to private sellers, I'd encourage laws that made criminals using firearms in the commission of a felony ineligible for parole, increase the penalties for straw purchases, and created penalties for people who don't securely store their firearms if that gun is used in a crime, and/or not reported stolen in a reasonable time frame.\n\nBut actually I wouldn't because I'm sure any law drafted and created would be abused by anti gun politicians who are blaming guns for societal problems that center around income inequality, mental health, and our abysmal social safety net.\n\nGun control should be targeting criminal activity and minimizing it's impact on law abiding citizens.",

However, in the student loan case...the current administration is arguing that the impact of the pandemic still affects borrowers and that's why relief is warranted, however, republican plaintiffs are arguing that the pandemic is over and relief is not justified or legal on these grounds...",

They have directly said that even if SCOTUS allowed the stay, they would not discontinue it immediately.\n\n*At the exact same time* as the Biden admin request SCOTUS to stay it, they also made a request for additional time to be added to it so that they could prepare to wind it down over a significantly long period of time, all of which indicates that this is not something that the admin would just \"cancel\" if SCOTUS put in a stay or allowed the lower courts' rulings to stand.\n\nWhat SCOTUS did say on the 20th is that in order for it to be repealed, they needed much more information from the Biden admin on what would replace it (something they have planned to do for over a year), which the admin was not prepared to provide at that point in time.\n\nThe Biden admin wanted to end the policy on May 23rd.  This ruling changes nothing, but this sub will throw a fit over it.\n\nAll of this indicates that while the admin does not want 42 to stay in place (which it shouldn't, it's a terrible policy), they were also woefully unprepared for how bad the situation actually is, and therefore that their replacement plans need to be reworked to fit this reality.\n\nI'm sure this will get downvoted because it contains actual nuance.",

Of the 3 page decision, 2 pages are comprised of Gorsuch explaining exactly why this is a bullshit order, then accusing the chucklefucks of legislating from the bench.\n\nThe states do not have standing to compel the federal government to argue harder in court (whatever the fuck they think the feds could say to make keeping an emergency order permanently is another story), nor is there a reasonable argument that the Circuit Court does not have the authority to rule such orders unconstitutional.\n\nThis stay is a gift to Republicans, and an embarrassment for the court.",

There's a lot of disinformation worming its way around online, and we are doing our best to fight it here in /r/news. Below you'll find a lot of important information to help you navigate voting and watching the results come in.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n## Your Voting Rights on Election Day\n\n1. The FBI [is warning](https://twitter.com/FBI/status/1589241399039463424) that people may try to scam you or lie to you about the date of the election or your polling place. **Today, Tuesday, November 8 is Election Day.** You can look up your polling place [here.](https://www.vote.org/polling-place-locator/)\n\n2. Many states require some form of identification to vote in person. And the laws in your state may have changed in recent years. Make sure to [check your local election rules](https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/voter-id.aspx#Laws%20in%20Effect) so you know what identification may be required.\n\n3. If the polls close while you are waiting in line to vote, REMAIN IN LINE. The polling location must let you vote if you were already in line before the polls closed. \n\n4. If you voted by mail, you can [track your ballot here.](https://www.cnet.com/news/politics/how-do-i-track-my-ballot-details-for-every-state/) \n\n5. You have the right to vote in private and without being intimidated. If you experience voter intimidation, let a poll worker know and then report it to the Election Protection Hotline (1-866-OUR-VOTE) or the US Department of Justice voting rights hotline (1-800-253-3931). You should also contact your state board of elections. \n\nNot sure what voter intimidation is? [The ACLU has a good explainer here.](https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_pdf_file/kyr-voterintimidation-v03.pdf)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n##Here's a quick FAQ to help you understand the 2022 midterm elections in the United States:\n\n\n* **When will we get results?**\n\n> Experts are predicting that it could take a few days to get the final unofficial vote tallies in some states. [FiveThirtyEight has a good breakdown here.](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/when-election-results-2022/) \n\n> The biggest reason for the expected delay in results this year is due to mail-in ballots - including ballots from military service members - which some states are not allowed to start counting until the polls close. For example, Pennsylvania does not start processing their mail-in ballots until Election Day, even if they've received them in advance. \n\n> In especially close races, the delays could be longer because it could come down to just a handful of votes. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n* **But all the ballots should be counted on election night!**\n\n> FALSE. On election night, experts make projections based on statistical probabilities with the data they have. It is normal for it to take weeks to count all the votes. The good news is that most states are optimistic that they can have the unofficial vote count available within the first 72 hours. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n* **Okay - but counting votes after election night will steal the election!**\n\n> FALSE. Mail in ballots have to be postmarked by Election Day, and many states require that they must be received by Election Day. States have to count all votes. Counting all the votes cast isn't \"stealing\" anything: it's making sure that every vote is counted, just like every other election.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* **What's this \"red mirage\" I keep hearing about?**\n\n> A \"red mirage\" is expected in some states where election day votes are counted first. This is because election day voters tend to skew Republican, while early voting and mail-in-ballots tend to skew Democrat. This means that a state, like Pennsylvania, will count those Election Day votes first, which will make it appear like the Republican candidates have a massive lead. \n\n> However, as election workers start counting those mail-in-ballots, the Democratic candidates will start gaining ground. This is expected. It's not fraud. It's just the votes being counted. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n* **What about the \"blue mirage\"? I've also heard that phrase floating around.**\n\n> Unlike Pennsylvania, Arizona begins counting votes as they are received. This means that early votes and mail-in-ballots will already be in the process of being counted on Election Day, and when polls close, it will look like the Democratic candidates have a lead. \n\n> As the night goes on, you should expect to see Republicans make up ground and you'll see a \"red shift\".  \n\n> This is why counting all the votes is not a partisan endeavor. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n* **Okay, so which states will have a \"red mirage\" or a \"blue mirage\"?**\n\nCNN has done a good job of [laying all this out](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/11/07/politics/blue-shift-red-mirage-2022-election-results/index.html) and explaining the mirages and shifts we might see this year. But here's a cheat sheet for you:\n\n> **Pennsylvania**: Likely red to blue\n\n> **Arizona**: Likely blue to red\n\n> **Georgia**: Likely red to blue\n\n> **Nevada**: Unclear\n\n> **Wisconsin**: Likely red to blue\n\n> **Michigan**: Likely red to blue\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* **Are mail-in ballots rife with fraud?**\n\n> No. Mail-in ballots are very secure and they are legal votes. Those ballots must be cast and post-marked by Election Day. We have been using mail-in ballots [since the Civil War](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/debate-over-mail-voting-dates-back-civil-war-180976091/), and in 2016, 25% of votes were cast by mail. In 2020, it rose to 46%, largely due to the pandemic. [Here's a handy chart showing how votes have been cast since 1992.](https://imgur.com/QFk3T6L)\n\n> Colorado is almost completely vote by mail and has some of the [most secure elections](https://www.rmpbs.org/blogs/news/experts-colorados-elections-system-is-the-gold-standard-nationally/) in the country. Check out this helpful vote by mail resource from the [Brennan Center](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/false-narrative-vote-mail-fraud). Heck, Ivanka and Jared even [voted by mail](https://twitter.com/IvankaTrump/status/1320775685514772480) in the 2020 election.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* **Are Democrats/Republicans/Aliens/Bigfoot trying to steal the election?**\n\n> No. Counting the votes is not stealing the election. Americans cast their votes and now we must wait for them all to be counted. \n\n&nbsp; \n\n* **Where can I find the official election results?**\n\n> The only official results are those certified by state elections officials. While the media can make projections based on ballots counted versus outstanding, state election officials are the authorities. So if you\u2019re not sure about a victory claim you\u2019re seeing in the media or from candidates, check back with the local officials. The National Association of Secretaries of States lets you look up state election officials [here.](https://www.nass.org/initiatives/trustedinfo)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n##Help us stop disinformation\n\nWe have a zero-tolerance policy for election disinformation. \n\nPlease report comments that:\n\n* Claim that mail-in ballots are fraudulent.\n\n* Claim that the election is being stolen.\n\n* Claim that a candidate has won an election before the results have been officially called.\n\n* Call for violence or try to organize for violent action.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWe've got a crazy week ahead of us, but if we all work together, we can do our part to protect the 2022 election.",

Previous school made him out to be a horror story, turns out he had to learn how to survive in a terrible inner city school and he just hadn't learned yet that he didn't need to be physically confrontational with other students to get by. He was just a kid who desperately wanted attention, and he would settle for negative attention if that's what it took.\n\nAnyhoo, kid was both a headache and amazing at the same time, and good news was his grandma in Colorado was finally set to adopt him... But for some nonsense reason our foster system shipped him to a new foster home 2 months before he was gonna be adopted, pulling him from his two younger half sisters.

Apparently IRL Sesame Place has a serious commitment to DEI and a very high percentage of the staff are POC.\n\nAll this is anecdotal but seems believeable; who knows though? Based on a show dedicated to diversity, Sesame Place seems like the last place where racism would be permitted. \n\nOne thing that stuck with me from that old thread is a former staffperson there predicting that since it's impossible to hug all the kids, cases like this are going to result in a policy change making any hugs prohibited.",

I had a book from the local library of '10 great drives in NYS' and I had been on all of them by the time I moved.  It really beat the hell out of southern Ohio where I had been living before since 2014.\n\nThat said, the whole 2014-2019 period is a different universe now.

The right to free speech and been largely held to protect hate speech. The most directly relevant case I can find is [*Village of Skokie v. National Socialist Party of America \\(Ill\\) \\(1978\\)*](https://www.mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/728/village-of-skokie-v-national-socialist-party-of-america-ill), which did make it to the Supreme Court, but in a confusing way. The Supreme Court remanded the case back down to the Illinois Supreme court, which found that public speech about Nazism and display of Swastikas could not be banned.\n\n>\u201cpublic expression of ideas may not be prohibited merely because the ideas are themselves offensive to some of their hearers.\u201d\n\nSummary from the article:\n>Governments could not choose what was acceptable public discourse based merely on the fact that certain symbols roused anger or resentment in the listener. The swastika could not be considered fighting words, nor could the audience\u2019s reaction be a justifiable reason for restricting speech.\n\nLatter Supreme Court jurisprudence, such as Virginia v. Black (2003) would indicate that Hate Speech can be regulated in cases where it constitutes a \"True Threat\".\n\nThis is complicated constitutional law, so I may have missed important precedent or misinterpreted some of what I read, but to my understanding, I don't think that any Supreme Court, and definitely not this one, would find that distributing pamphlets with Swastikas in them would constitute a True Threat.",

Every remote job I've looked into since I was ready to go back to work has either needed requirements I don't have, never contacted me back or has been a scam. \n\nJust wear the fucking mask.

            "selftext": "On election night, President Trump prematurely declared victory and claimed that the Democrats are stealing the election. **This is false.** \n\n&nbsp;\n\n##Here's a quick FAQ to help you understand what is currently happening in the United States:\n\n\n* **When will we get results?**\n\n> Experts are predicting that it could take up to a week (or more) to get the final unofficial vote tallies in some states. [The NYTimes has a really helpful chart that explains what to expect in each state.](https://nyti.ms/369bnhp) \n\n> The biggest reason for the expected delay in results this year is due to mail-in ballots - including ballots from military service members - which some states were not allowed to start counting until the polls close. For example, Pennsylvania did not start processing their mail-in ballots until Election Day and may not finish counting them all until November 6th. Keep in mind that we've had historically high numbers of mail-in ballots this year, and counting them all takes time due to the robust security measures in place. \n\n> To dig into this even more, we can look at Michigan and Pennsylvania: \n\n> * Michigan - As of 10:30am ET on 11/4, 10% of votes are left to count, and Biden has a small lead. The bulk of the remaining ballots are in Detroit\u2019s Wayne County, but the clerk there has not (yet) given a timeframe for when we can expect results. Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson is promising a \"much more complete picture of Michigan by the end of the day\".\n\n> * Pennsylvania - As of 10:30am ET on 11/4, 22% of votes are left to count. We are unlikely to know the final count today because 1) Philadelphia, its suburbs, and Pittsburgh are still counting ballots, and 2) ballots can still arrive by Friday if postmarked on Election Day (though this is likely to be challenged at the Supreme Court). \n\n&nbsp;\n\n* **But we've never had an election where ballots weren't all counted on election night!**\n\n> FALSE. On election night, experts make projections based on statistical probabilities with the data they have. It is normal for it to take weeks to count all the votes. The good news is that most states are optimistic that they can have the unofficial vote count available by the end of the week. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n* **Okay - but counting votes after election night will steal the election!**\n\n> FALSE. Ballots have to be postmarked by Election Day, and many states require that they must be received by Election Day. States have to count all votes. Counting all the votes cast isn't \"stealing\" anything: it's making sure that every vote is counted, just like every other election.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* **What's the deal with Pennsylvania? Why are so many people alarmed?**\n\n> Experts anticipated a \"red mirage\" in Pennsylvania that would later be subject to a \"blue shift\" -- and it looks like that's what we're seeing right now. You can read a really detailed explanation [here.](https://53eig.ht/2TKgBu4)\n\n> Here's what's happening: Pennsylvania counted the in-person Election Day vote first and that vote favored President Trump, as expected. Mail-in ballots are counted later, and are expected to favor Biden. This is why we saw Trump with a big lead on election night and a shrinking lead as of this morning. You should expect to continue to see this shrink.\n\n> Simply put: We need to wait for all the votes to be counted before calling the winner.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* **What about Arizona?**\n\n> Arizona is interesting because it could actually experience a \"red shift\". Early votes were expected to favor Biden, and over the course of the night, the race has tightened. While some media outlets have called Arizona for Biden, we should keep an eye on it.\n\n> This is why counting all the votes is not a partisan endeavor. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n* **Are mail-in ballots rife with fraud?**\n\n> No. Mail-in ballots are very secure. Colorado is almost completely vote by mail and has some of the most secure elections in the country.

Americans cast their votes and now we must wait for them all to be counted. \n\n&nbsp; \n\n* **Where can I find the official election results?**\n\n> The only official results are those certified by state elections officials. While the media can make projections based on ballots counted versus outstanding, state election officials are the authorities.

The ramifications of the assassination led to his Martyrdom, the Liberators' civil war and ultimately to the Principate period of the Roman Empire.\n\n\nHere is how it went down:\n>Caesar was walking to the senate house when he caught sight of Spurinna. \"Well, the Ides of March have come!\" Caesar called out playfully. \"Aye, the Ides have come,\" said Spurinna, \"but they are not yet gone.\"[49][50] Mark Antony started to enter with Caesar, but was intercepted by one of the plotters (either Trebonius or Decimus Brutus) and detained outside. He remained there until after the assassination, at which point he fled.\n\n\n>According to Plutarch, as Caesar took his seat, Lucius Tillius Cimber presented him with a petition to recall his exiled brother. The other conspirators crowded round to offer their support. Both Plutarch and Suetonius say that Caesar waved him away, but Cimber grabbed Caesar's shoulders and pulled down Caesar's toga. Caesar then cried to Cimber, \"Why, this is violence!\" (\"Ista quidem vis est!\"). At the same time, Casca produced his dagger and made a glancing thrust at the dictator's neck. Caesar turned around quickly and caught Casca by the arm. According to Plutarch, he said in Latin, \"Casca, you villain, what are you doing?\". Casca, frightened, shouted simultaneously \"Brother! Help me!\" (Ancient Greek: \u1f00\u03b4\u03b5\u03bb\u03c6\u03ad, \u03b2\u03bf\u03ae\u03b8\u03b5\u03b9, romanized: adelphe, boethei). Though Caesar was able to violently throw Casca away, Gaius Servilius Casca stabbed him in the side. Within moments, Caesar was attacked from all directions, with Cassius, slashing Caesar's face, Bucilianus stabbing at the back and Decimus slicing his thigh. Caesar attempted to fight back, but tripped and fell; the men continued stabbing him as he lay defenseless on the lower steps of the portico. Caesar was stabbed 23 times. Suetonius relates that a physician who performed an autopsy on Caesar established that only one wound (the second one to his ribs) had been fatal. This autopsy report (the earliest known post-mortem report in history) describes that Caesar's death was mostly attributable to blood loss from his stab wounds.",

See, if you want billions in federal dollars to keep flowing, you keep exaggerating how polluted it is.  Yet, thousands of employees drive into work every day, they can go wherever they want on the Hanford reservation.\n\nYes, there are gallons of radioactive waste in the tank farms, which are buried and release no radiation.  Yes they leak, onto basically impenetrable basalt rock caused by volcanic lava flows thousands of years ago.\n\nMost countries would just fill those tank farms with concrete grout and call it good.  Kudos to us, for being more careful, as we are building a multi billion dollar \"vitrification plant\" designed to pump the fluid out, fill it with silica until it is solid, then pack off the radioactive \"logs\" to yucca mountain.  At least.  That was the plan.  Now it will probably just  be buried on site at Gable mountain, which is where they should have stored it from the beginning.\n\nEven Lefties are waking up to the fact that clean energy of the future means nuclear power.  Yes, the people who developed the atomic bomb and other nuclear materials in WW2 and the Cold War didn't know very much what they are doing, but we have learned now, and nuclear power is basically about as safe as you can get compared to other energy sources other than hydro.",

Bundling did not matter.  End users chose Netscape because it was better.\n\nThe majority of internet access came from small dial up providers and we all provided Netscape 3 on CD's and even floppies. \n\nThen Netscape did a complete re-write of Netscape code. Jamie Zawinski, one of the first Netscape employees and better known as jwz (you could type about:jwz in the browser and get his home page, that's how key he was inside Netscape), wrote about the disaster that was the Netscape 4 re write.\n\nIt was slow.  It was buggy.  But worst of all, in the era of dial up internet, it couldn't handle area codes!\n\nI talked to other nearby ISP owners that I was friends with and asked them what they were doing because the Netscape dial up admin kit couldn't be configured with area codes.  They said, \"We gave up and only ship Internet Explorer.\"  \n\nThat wasn't good enough for me.  I contacted Netscape about the problem.  I worked up through tech support tiers until I was told, \"We won't look at it if you aren't a corporate partner.\"  I explained that I was already spending around $5,000 a month on Netscape licenses for my customers.  They said license purchases don't matter, \"You need to pay a $75K fee to get corporate level tech support.\"  \n\nSo that ended my attempt at putting Netscape first on the CD we shipped to customers.  For the next 2 years, during the greatest growth of the Internet for the world, every small ISP, which represented the majority of dial up access, shipped Internet Explorer.\n\nIt wasn't a conspiracy.  It wasn't dirty business.  It was Netscape's gross incompetence.  They were too busy chasing corporate American to care about the individual consumers.",

IE, from 4.x onwards, supported more and more of CSS.\n\nThis is exactly the same way Chrome took over the world. It went into a stagnant monopolist market and shook it up, just as IE had done before it.\n\nNetscape's marketshare had been in rapid decline before IE was bundled with Windows98 or later versions of 95. Nobody loved the Netscape monopoly and we were all happy to get rid of it. Some of us (myself included) ran both for a while, but Netscape 4.7 just lagged more and more with each new IE release. IE 3 was admittedly just \"feature parity\" and you still needed Netscape for some complex sites to display properly, but you still had IE because it was faster.\n\nYou didn't use IE because it was bundled (or nobody would have used Chrome, right?), you used it because it was faster, more supportive of standards (and then, didn't), did more, worked with more.\n\nNetscape's problem was awful management. Netscape had grown a lot, so brought in seasoned business managers, who ran Netscape like a traditional business. This meant that new ideas had to go up the chain and back down again after approval, by which time they weren't new ideas anymore. The spontaneous \"this is cool, let's do it\" was gone, which meant the developers and engineers had lost their enthusiasm.\n\nNetscape's Navigator had been built on rapid releases, cool features being included by concensus and enthusiasm, rapid development cycles, weekly team meetings, daily scrums, everything that would later become the \"Agile\" model. The cold, methological corporate world, still embodying the \"Waterfall\" model emphasised stability, steady growth, formal project management and change control, development to a checklist of features and requirements: All traits fatal to a young and dynamic Internet startup.\n\nBut you could take the simple, easier to understand, and wrong answer \"Microsoft cheated\". Most people don't remember that IE really was the new and cool and Netscape was the clunky, old and bloated, so you might even get away with it.\n\nThose of us who were there, however, remember it differently.",

(Periods might have helped but those are also verboten.)\n\nThen I learned from [this 1877 history of Block Island](https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/public/gdcmassbookdig/historyofblockis00livermo/historyofblockis00livermo.pdf) that the John in question is probably John E. Rose, whose family was among the island's first inhabitants, from 1664 (p342). John's ancestor (grandfather?) Samuel contracted the island's first postal route in 1832, which eventually passed to John's father, William.\n\nWhen William died, John had to bid for a new contract.\n\n> A competitor and he ran their bids down to the sum of *one cent a year*, and the mail between Block Island and Newport was therefore carried four years for *four cents*, and Capt. John E. Rose says he has received only *one cent* of that pay yet, and that one cent was paid him by a man in Providence who wanted to buy distinction by paying from his own pocket the whole expense of carrying the Block Island mail one year. The Captain's enterprise and perseverance have put him handsomely and domestically beyond the need of the three cents still due to him from the United States.\n\n(p.45, ibid, emphasis original)\n\nWhich sounds like a crazy story, but then the next hit on Google is [this 1870 House report from the Postmaster](https://books.google.com/books/about/House_Documents.html?id=KfdYAAAAcAAJ) that shows there were three bids for US Postal Route 812, from Newport to New Shoreham (a.k.a.

I recently had someone I was dating relapse, and it unfortunately turned my life upside down once again.  She mislead about going to any sort of real treatment despite claiming she was and wanted to, and has done nothing but show signs of not getting better.  Not even going to lie I had a few nights of getting blackout drunk to deal with the heartache.  Not proud of it, but didn't let it be the end of me either.  When you stick to this whole recovery thing, and have the resources around you, even when you aren't perfect and things go south, you'll respond to it better and faster than you used to.   Happy to now be on track again, with just another learning experience and story to tell.  Counting years is worthwhile, but never more important than just being gentle and patient with yourself if you do fuck up.  That's what I have learned.  Life will show up.  That horrible triggering thing that always did you in in the past, will happen again.   All you can do is do better than last time.",

            "title": "Told my Brother and his wife (& their dog) they can\u2019t stay with me while they\u2019re \u201clooking for a place\u201d",
            "selftext": "I am recently windowed. I lost my husband very suddenly to brain cancer after 40 years of marriage. I was his sole caretaker in his final days, and it was incredibly difficult for me, both mentally and physically. I\u2019ve been caring for our two children their whole lives and still continue to help out my adult children by helping out with my grandkids to this day. \n\nAfter my husband died in November, I packed up my entire life and moved across the country to TN, I bought my dream home, (my husband never could bring himself to retire so we were unable to fulfill this dream when he was alive). I bought my daughter and her two kids a home about 30 mins away from my house, so they could be nearby and have the same fresh start I have. Things have been great, a lot of change, but we\u2019re excited to finally have done something big and brave with our lives, and feel hopeful about the future again. Just a new chapter for us all.\n\nMy kids and I joked between ourselves that my older brother and his longtime wife would surely eventually try to move in with me. They do have a history of taking advantage of situations, and people, but at the same time, we\u2019re very close, and good people at heart. Although, my brother has made a lot of mistakes financially that have haunted them throughout the past several decades of their lives. They currently stay in a tiny apartment in Southern California, owned by their adult son. They don\u2019t pay much rent, if any, and while my brother does do some remote freelance consulting work, I have no idea how much they make or have to support themselves. \n\nBecause I moved from CA to TN, I have a much bigger house now- it\u2019s just me and my dogs, which is exactly how I want it. My daughter and her two kids totally could have lived with me in my house, but after 40 years of being the main caretaker for my family, I\u2019m ready to take this time for myself, while I still can. I enjoy being alone, having my own space, and doing what I wish each day, for the first time in my 63 years on earth. \n\nMy brother and his wife came out to visit a few weeks back and really loved it out here, they talked about finding a place for themselves, maybe a small rental home or an apartment nearby, so we could spend time together. I would love to see them regularly and have them over for bbqs, etc. but several weeks after their visit they texted me letting me know they had hired movers and were going to put all their belongings in my workshop and stay with me for \u201ca few days\u201d while they look for a place of their own. \n\nMy daughter freaked out, said they will never leave, and if they do  it\u2019ll be because I had to help them get approved for a lease and help with down-payments/ security deposit etc. Suddenly, I could feel my newfound freedom, that I\u2019ve waited over 40 years to claim, slipping through my fingers. The stress of not knowing how long they (and their dog) would stay or if they\u2019d ever leave was overwhelming. I got the courage to tell them that they need to find a place before they move out here. Their reaction was even more upsetting than their initial plans. \n\nIn fairness to my brother, he replied \u201cno prob\u201d as he tends to sweep things under the rug and pretend they never happened, which in this case, was fine with me. But my Sister in law sent me a defensive text asking why I have \u201clost all faith in them,\u201d saying \u201cher credit is good\u201d and they would only stay with me a few days. However in the very next line, she wrote that if they didn\u2019t find a place, they would get a storage unit for all their belongings, as if their furniture in my workshop would be the issue. I felt like she totally contradicted herself, only further revealing their lack of a stable plan, an vast void in logic that would inevitably fall on me to fill in perpetuity. All I could say is finding a place before moving out here really is the only way- but that I hope they do find a place and move out here soon. She stopped replying to me and is now ghosting me. They know I don\u2019t like confrontation and that the tension is surely wearing me down. \n\nI have no assurance they could get approved for a lease with their history, nor that they even really want to. Apart of me thinks they believe that because I have a large home, live alone, and live comfortably, they deserve a piece of the pie my late husband and I spent our entire lives making. and I\u2019m being selfish by setting what I see as healthy boundaries. Did I dodge the biggest bullet ever or am I the asshole for not letting them come move in \u201ctemporarily?\u201d",

            "selftext": "Hey all,\n\nSome of you may be aware that Reddit [posted an announcement thread today](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12qwagm/an_update_regarding_reddits_api/) detailing some serious planned changes to the API. The overview was quite broad causing some folks to have questions about specific aspects. I had two calls with Reddit today where they explained things and answered my questions.\n\nHere's a bullet point synopsis of what was discussed that should answer a bunch of questions. Basically, changes be coming, but not *necessarily* for the worse in all cases, provided Reddit is reasonable.\n\n- Offering an API is expensive, third party app users understandably cause a lot of server traffic\n- Reddit appreciates third party apps and values them as a part of the overall Reddit ecosystem, and does *not* want to get rid of them\n- To this end, Reddit is moving to a paid API model for apps. The goal is not to make this inherently a big profit center, but to cover both the costs of usage, as well as the opportunity costs of users not using the official app (lost ad viewing, etc.)\n- They spoke to this being a more equitable API arrangement, where Reddit doesn't absorb the cost of third party app usage, and as such could have a more equitable footing with the first party app and not favoring one versus the other as as Reddit would no longer be losing money by having users use third party apps\n- The API cost will be usage based, not a flat fee, and will *not* require Reddit Premium for users to use it, nor will it have ads in the feed. Goal is to be reasonable with pricing, not prohibitively expensive.\n- Free usage of the API for apps like Apollo is not something they will offer. Apps will either need to offer an ad-supported tier (if the API rates are reasonable enough), and/or a subscription tier like Apollo Ultra.\n- If paying, access to more APIs (voting in polls, Reddit Chat, etc.) is \"a reasonable ask\"\n- How much will this usage based API cost? It is not finalized yet, but plans are within 2-4 weeks\n- For NSFW content, they were not 100% sure of the answer (later clarifying that with NSFW content they're talking about sexually explicit content only, not normal posts marked NSFW for non-sexual reasons), but thought that it would no longer be possible to access via the API, I asked how they balance this with plans for the API to be more equitable with the official app, and there was not really an answer but they did say they would look into it more and follow back up. I would like to follow up more about this, especially around content hosting on other websites that is posted to Reddit.\n- They seek to make these changes while in a dialog with developers \n- This is not an immediate thing rolling out tomorrow, but rather this is a heads up of changes to come\n- There was a quote in an article about how these changes would not affect Reddit apps, that was meant in reference to \"apps on the Reddit platform\", as in embedded into the Reddit service itself, not mobile apps \n\ntl;dr: Paid API coming.\n\nMy thoughts: I think if done well and done reasonably, this could be a positive change (but that's a big if). If Reddit provides a means for third party apps to have a stable, consistent, and future-looking relationship with Reddit that certainly has its advantages, and does not sound unreasonable, *provided the pricing is reasonable*.\n\nI'm waiting for future communication and will obviously keep you all posted. If you have more questions that you think I missed, please post them and I'll do my best to answer them and if I don't have the answer I'll ask Reddit.\n\n\\- Christian\n\n\n### Update April 19th\n\nReceived an email clarifying that they will have a fuller response on NSFW content available soon (which hopefully means some wiggle room or access if certain conditions are met), but in the meantime wanted to clarify that the updates will only apply to content or pornography material. Someone simply tagging a sports related post or text story as NSFW due to material would not be filtered out.\n\nAgain I also requested clarification on content of a more explicit nature, stating that if there needs to be further guardrails put in place that Reddit is implementing, that's something that I'm happy to ensure is properly implemented on my end as well.\n\nAnother thing to note is [that just today Imgur banned sexually explicit uploads](https://help.imgur.com/hc/en-us/articles/14415587638029) to their platform, which serves as the main place for NSFW Reddit image uploads, such as r/gonewild (to my knowledge the most popular NSFW content), due to Reddit not allowing explicit content to be uploaded directly to Reddit.",

The guilt would eat me up because it felt like a waste but sometimes you just need the break.\n\nJust one night of sleeping on a bed in a safe-ish and private space then I would go back to my 'normal' anxiety riddled life the next day.

The owner passed unexpected and my lease was on a month to month the judge ruled i had 4 days left in the month and had four days to leave . Period. Luckily I was young and resilient and figured it out and made it work and after being denied being able to stay with my mom or any of my family. I slept in my car , friends couches , or didn\u2019t sleep at all. I made it. Several years later in life with a two year old , my fianc\u00e9 and her father passed away. We were sharing a house with my then SIL she kicked me out, stole everything i owned. There was nothing I could do. Even tho i had lived there 3 years the sherif wouldn\u2019t let me get anything. She basically talked her way out of anything . Total con artist. We bounced around a little while but we made it work. It eventually all worked out . I never let it get me down and i did everything i and to do make sure we were safe. She\u2019s 9 now. I own two business , two vehicles , we have a country farm house and moved a couple hundred miles south!  She now has a little brother and i have gotten married.

Got the keys after months of homelessness and I went inside casually like nothing happened. \n\nI collapsed on my bed and wept from the weirdest, darkest part of me. It felt like something inside of me was scraping at the edges of my existence and I cried myself to sleep. It was the best sleep of my life and I slept like 19 hours.\n\nI was 28 years old then. I'm 38 years old today and have a fancy apartment, a great job and more things than I know what to do with. Never let that go. Never let go of what you did to get there. You did it.

So fucking proud of you.",

I\u2019m sorry your mom didn\u2019t provide you with the parenting support you needed, but you sound resilient and determined and I can only imagine that you will go places in life. Set your sights high, you can do it!  Find a good paying career that doesn\u2019t require a bunch of student loans if you can (construction, radiology or sonography tech, you can google which jobs will be in demand in the future and sort by pay rate us dept of labor and statistics.). Use condoms so you don\u2019t get anyone pregnant before you\u2019re ready!  Putting in the hard work now while you\u2019re young will pay off. If you can get a union job with an apprenticeship, you can get paid while you work/learn. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry your mother did this to you. If you can get counseling, I highly suggest it. That way you won\u2019t end up choosing women like your mom. We have a tendency to repeat those unhealthy behaviors/relationships because they are familiar to us. \n\nBe proud of yourself. You\u2019re doing great despite the odds. You haven\u2019t succumbed to self medicating either. Your tenacity is impressive. A google search shows there are many programs for male mentorship around the country, so if you can find one near you, sign up!\n\nIf you ever need someone to tell you they\u2019re proud of you, let me know and I\u2019ll send many positive messages to you!

Enjoy the wonderful feeling of knowing where you're going to sleep every night and that you're safe. \n\nThe only thing I can relate to you about is the horrible mom. My mom is pure evil. I didn't discover this until I was an adult. I grew up thinking I had a wonderful, caring, loving mom. After going through a year of counseling I learned what I really had was a controlling, manipulative, evil, narcissistic egg donor. It sucked! I felt the same way you do. I'd see mothers being good, loving mothers towards their kids and think why can't i have that. It takes awhile but it does get easier and you'll realize you are better off without her in your life. She kicked you out of her house and let you struggle to survive on the streets... she doesn't deserve your love.",

And she\u2019s not even all that bad, if you look at the spectrum of bad parents.

Parents who do this have already decided their child isn\u2019t a priority. It sucks, it hurts, but we need to recognize this so we stop putting ourselves into situations where the failed parent can further cause us problems.\n\nIn my case, the parent continued to be a problem, and combined that with continuing to pretend they had parental authority over me and spewed unending demands on how I act, how I live my life, etc. I shut them down but eventually had to cut them off because it turned out anything I told to them, they\u2019d spread to other negative or bad people in my life I was trying to get away from as well. That betrayal was the last straw.\n\nRecognize that parental betrayal, and act carefully based on that.",

How Ruth has the abortion because \u201cit\u2019s not the right time and not the right baby\u201d and then it\u2019s never brought up again or used against her in any way. How Cherry used to want children, and even suffered through a miscarriage, but then admits that she\u2019s changed her mind about having a baby.  And how her husband, even though he\u2019s initially shocked and devastated, eventually comes to terms with her decision and supports her. I loved all the women in that show.

If motherhood actually is important to the show, then it's really well-hidden.\n\nNow that I think about it, the show kinda shits on parenthood. Tahani's biggest issues stem from her emotionally abusive parents. She was born into wealth and never wanted for anything, except for the approval of her parents, and that was more than enough to mess her up for her whole life. Eleanor was fucked up by her emotionally abusive, alcoholic mother and neglectful father, too.\n\nSo two of the four human characters had life-long issues causes by their parents, and it was through friendship, mentorship, and commitment to personal growth that they finally found peace. Family and parenthood were never a central theme, and when they were, it was to show how crazy they can make us.",

It was refreshing to see characters put things before the need to have kids.\n\nEdit: I'm not going to say the show name bc is literally the end of the show spoiler but if you really want to know, Google the character Thelonious Jaha.",

If someone has kids, they get to experience childhood again. Not like playing with toys or anything like that, but by watching children grow up, they get a secondhand childhood experience through the eyes of an adult. Maybe they feel like their life is fuller now because they've gotten to experience an entire life again and all the milestones that come with it again.\n\nJust a thought.",

I don't think you are special for having one, I don't think you are a deep person for getting a random Chinese character on your skin, I especially don't like those intricate big tattoos that cover a lot of skin. I just don't like them. Having said that, I have friends that have all of the above, and that's fine, it's not on my skin, it doesn't bother me, and as long as we can talk about anything else, it's all fine.\n\nEnter my soon to be wife. We've been together for 5 years. She is painfully aware of my feelings. But she still wanted to have a tattoo before we marry. A symbol of us to carry with her. I didn't really like the idea, but what can I really do? I love her, and what harm can a tattoo do?\n\nWe talked where she should have it done, and the back of the wrist came as a suggestion, the shoulder, on her leg, on her back (tramp stamp), etc.\n\nShe goes and has it done, and I can't be there with her because I have an important client visiting at work, and time off is impossible. She texts me during work. She tells me it's done. That she loves me. I ask for a picture of the end result, and she tells me tonight, it will be a surprise.\n\nSo I finally get home, she's dolled up, super tight black dress, stockings, everything for a night of fun. She tells me to go have a shower, and she will have dinner ready in the meantime. I ask to see the tattoo, she tells me later. I am frustrated, go have the shower, come back, have dinner.\n\nThen we go to the fun stuff. I didn't see the tattoo on her wrist or legs, so I think to myself it is either on her back, upper thigh, or her shoulder. I am fine with that. I undo her zipper in the back, then she returns and lets her dress down. Instant boner killer...\n\nShe had it done on her chest, above her breasts. It's big and in your face. It leaks above her breasts (like on top of the breasts). It has thick contours.\n\nYeah, this didn't go well with me. She completely ignored my opinions, she disregarded the places where we agreed she could have it done, and it's a monstrosity of a tattoo in a place where I will always have to see it if we make love or she wears a bikini or something that has a cleavage.\n\nIt is also something that is personal to me. Of all the things she mentioned the tattoo will be, she never told me about this. She said she wanted to be a gift to me, to show me her dedication.\n\nI feel disrespected, ignored, like my wishes and desires have no meaning to her. To me it shows what she thinks my status will be in our relationship, that she will just be able to go over anything I say and take drastic decisions without caring of the consequences.\n\nWell, a consequence of this is that I am calling off the wedding.\n\nShe is in freak out mode. Says she thought I will like it. That she wanted to show her dedication to me. That she will have it removed. Basically anything she thinks I want to hear.\n\nMy side of the family is understanding of my reaction, they know my standing on this matter, they know it wasn't something just liked to pretend I hate but secretly love.\n\nHer side of the family is split. Her mother is more conservative, so her motives are not too straight forward. Her father is on my side. Her sister is all in on dear sister's side. Her brother is neutral, doesn't want to get involved.\n\nTo me, even if she gets the tattoo removed, it shows her willingness to ignore my side of things, do things her way, then scramble and try to fix the eventual fuckup. I can't have that in a relationship.\n\nWhat do you guys think? The wedding is definitely off, that decision I won't revert.\n\nWhat steps would you take regarding the relationship?\n\nIs there anything worth saving here? Is this how she will always be, or was this a spur of the moment decision?\n\nAny advice will be appreciated.\n\nThank you.\n\n**RELEVANT COMMENTS**\n\n\ncuriousof\n\n\n>Out of curiosity, what was the tattoo of?\n\nOOP replied \n\n>Wings, with a heart in the middle. Inside the heart there is a symbol that is a birth sign I have on my body.\n\n[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/97sxfq/update_i_m31_dont_like_tattoos_and_my_soon_to_be/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)  **Aug 16, 2018**\n\n\nI would like to thank those who provided feedback and perspective, and have not straight out called me an asshole.\n\nWe will continue with the wedding as planned. We realize we still need to work on our communication. But we are also painfully aware how miserable we both were during this whole ordeal. This has been our first serious \"fight\".\n\nWhat happened?\n\nInsecurity. She had this idea that I don't think she is dedicated to our relationship. She wanted to prove it somehow. Turns out, the end result wasn't something she was that happy with either. My initial reaction didn't help, and for the next few days things spiraled out of control.\n\nAfter the post here on reddit, I decided we need to sit down and put our ducks in order. I love her, and she loves me, and there was no reason why we would not be able to untangle this mess.\n\nWhy I hate tattoos? All she knew is that I am not a fan of them, but not the reason. When I was younger, a lot younger, I was horribly abused by someone that had many tattoos. I don't associate people that have tattoos with abusers, but I am also not a fan of the tattoo culture because of it.\n\nShe didn't know, because I never talked with her about it. I suppose I never wanted her to think I am vulnerable. Or that I was. You can imagine, after these many years, my thoughts on the matter are still mixed.\n\nAnyway, she was horrified to learn about this, started crying.\n\nShe will have the tattoo removed. After the original post I have come to the conclusion that her new skin decoration is something I will have to live with, but at the end of the day, she is the one I want, and a mild annoyance will not define our relationship. I told her this, but she will get it removed anyway. I think she is horrified by the revelation :(\n\nWe also decided on couple's counseling, to see if it is something that will work for us. If either of us will be uncomfortable, we will not continue with it.\n\nWe also decided not to be assholes to one another in petty matters. I will wear shorts again, god dammit! Ha ha, that was a funny conversation. We won't impose restrictions on one another. I will go out with friends and watch football with them again. She can go and meet her girlfriends. We will put a lot of work in ourselves individually, and as a couple.\n\nTurns out, we have a problem with communication. But the prospects are positive.\n\nHer insecurities didn't want me to go out with friends, because some of them are single, and what if they bring women there that tempt me? So she always had to be there. But she doesn't like football, so you can see where this is going.\n\nI am happy with the results of the original post. She is happy I took the initiative and broke the ice. My fears were she had the tattoo done as a \"power play\". But there was no malice. I want a relationship of equals, where a decision can be made as a couple.\n\nWe will see where this is going, but the last two days have been amazing.\n\nI was asked this question, so here is the answer: we live together. We own a house 50 - 50. The night of the tattoo reveal, I went to my parents. She went to her parents. Essentially, until two days ago none of us lived home. She said she doesn't want to be there if I am not there.\n\nAs a closing note, this could have been a huge mistake for both of us. Communication is key. I urge couples out there to learn from my story, and open up to one another. Had I done that sooner, I would have never been here.\n\nThank you.\n\n\n**~OOP ALSO ADDED IN THE COMMENTS~**\n\n\nHey, thanks for reaching out.\n\nThis last week has actually been amazing for the two of us.\n\nShe actually already consulted a specialist in tattoo removal. he's also a plastic surgeon, and has some recent type of laser that is apparently very good at removing tattoos. He said there would be no significant scarring, maybe where the lines are really thick, but he thinks it will not be noticeable. Alternatively, if she goes for more less intense sessions, it could go out without any scars.\n\nShe's happy about that.\n\nAnd she also talked with the person that will do her makeup for the wedding, and they already tested a tattoo coverup cream (makeup?).\n\nThe tattoo opened all doors. We talked about our insecurities, and needs, and wants. And we know where we both stand. There is not much difference of opinion. She was very insecure about my dedication to the relationship, since the grand gesture through the tattoo. And her insecurity was immediately confirmed by my reaction, because she rationalized that even if I hate tattoos, if I love her I will work through it. She was lacking some information from my past, though, and since we had time to talk, I hope she knows I am with her, and my reaction was not about her or my feelings toward her.\n\n**THIS IS A REPOST SUB - I AM NOT THE OOP**",

In the previous Place, we had our national flag with Nelson Mandela in the middle, and a few South African stuff spread around the section. And a major thing was that we had like 5 or 6 African country flags underneath ours, that we protected.\n\nThis time around...it was not so great. We had a fight with a Twitch streamer who wiped our flag when we went to sleep, and had to find another area to start all over again. Also we did not help the other African countries to show their presence. I think we only did Namibia. The Kenyans made a flag nearby after someone posted on their sub, but it got destroyed a few hours later and we did nothing to help. The Moroccans were botting like crazy. I suggested to our Discord admins that we  should work with them, but got no feedback.\n\nThe south Americans did really well. Kudos to Brazil and Argentina for their humongous artworks! The Pele and Messi designs were amazing.\n\nOn the US flag... I don't think they pulled as much resources as they could have. When the canvas expanded and we South Africa were wiped overnight, our initial expansion spot was shaping up nicely but we were losing the pixel battle. Once we abandoned that spot, we noticed that it was Ohio that took it. Some of us were pissed that the Americans couldn't just use their national flag, but had Ohio on its own.

They kept talking fast, over each other and being overly friendly insisting they would help (even for the nicest people we had met there, these were too nice). I kept my MIL behind me (between me and the cab) and kept my grip on my bags while my partner put the rest in the trunk.\n\nEven when we were getting on the cab they kept trying to make conversation, opening/closing doors for us but in a rushed way (not like when someone is being nice to you). My MIL who is a senior felt like she practically had to jump in the cab and she was hanging to her purse with a vice grip.\n\nThe whole thing was a confusing minute or two. We were aware of pockets and keeping them away from them the whole time (personally I rarely carry much money in my pockets when abroad, I carry most of it divided in different items on my body, not much I can do if I get mugged but makes it harder for a pickpocket, lol).

It seems like this could have been quite embarrassing.",
                "Good luck with that, it takes me about 2 minutes to get my wallet out of my pocket myself, let alone someone else.\n\nYes, this happens.  I'm from London, I've literally locked eyes with several people who were in the process of pickpocketing people near me and/or people I was travelling with, and I've also thwarted attempts to \"herd\" a victim where one of them bumps or crushes onto a train with the victim, while another takes things from their bag or pocket.\n\nLiterally two or more people who were together earlier.  Then they separate to different parts of the train platform without communicating for no reason at all.  Then they start honing into their victim at the same time.  Then them seeing that I'm actually watching them, and with some rapid shared furtive glances abandoning their attempt and leaving the platform without a word said.  That's \\*not\\* natural behaviour.\n\nOne such potential-victim was my girlfriend with an unzipped bag with the open part exposed behind her arm (I don't know how many times I'd told her!).  She saw, suspected and noticed NOTHING throughout.  And I had done her bag zip up for her when I was sure that the pickpockets weren't a threat any more, and she didn't even feel it.\n\nIf you're travelling in a city... don't flash valuables (especially phones).  If you take calls, keep a tight grip on that phone and stay aware (best way is NOT to keep walking and talking... stop walking, tuck yourself into a corner where people can only approach you from one direction, and keep an eye out).  Be aware of everyone around you.  Not paranoid, just aware.  Make sure that anything of value isn't worth the effort... they can just snatch and run even the most \"closed\" of bags, but you just have to make it not worth their risk.  Keep an eye out, a tight hand on it, and show that it's not just being ignored.\n\nAnd keep your wallet/phone/whatever in a tight and inaccessible pocket.  Jean pockets, under a jacket.  Or the inner jacket pocket, buttoned up and DO NOT unzip your jacket.  I've asked people to step the fuck away from me when I'm withdrawing cash from an ATM.  Classic crowding technique to grab your money and run.  I stop, turn round, say \"Not being funny, mate, but this is London.  Could you step back...  you're making me nervous.\"  Most often just people not thinking (and they're always co-operative and apologise) or not used to leaving a gap, but a couple of times I think it was actually catching them in the act (just because of the area I was in at the time).\n\nAnd pat your pockets regularly.  Every time you stand up.  Every time you are going into a crowd.  Every time you have been through a crowd.  Make it so that it \"feels\" empty not to have your wallet on you because it's always there and you know where it is.  Some people will say patting your pocket lets people know where it is?  They know anyway.  And they will try three empty pockets without their owners knowing before they hit the one that works.  But if you pat all your pockets (keys, wallet, phone, tissues, yep, got everything), they have no idea which, and they know you're checking and aware.\n\nLived in London all my life.  Literally everyone I've ever asked has been mugged, their phone stolen, robbed, card cloned, bag mysteriously \"go missing\" - even in hospital waiting rooms (classic as people put their bags under their seat while they wait), theatres, broad-daylight, etc. etc. etc.  I haven't ever had that, not even once.  And I'm a weedy-looking fuck who would look easy to intimidate or overpower.  If a fight or scuffle started, they'd win.  But they hate starting any scuffle with someone who knows or suspects what's coming.\n\nAwareness is key.  I can't walk out my front door without my wallet without knowing something's wrong before I even close it behind me.  It's a great way to never got locked out!\n\nAnd I lose track of the number of times I've moved my partner to walk on the other side of me when I see people we need to pass in a subway or tight space, and they later ask \"Why did you do that?\" and they've totally failed to spot all kinds of things that I've seen the people up ahead doing (and then put myself between them and her open bag, or her phone that she was talking on, etc.).",

Cluster munition use on civilians is a war crime.  ruzzia has been using cluster munitions and thermobaric weapons on civilians and civilian areas - hence a war crime in each use.  Ukraine would like to have cluster munitions to use in the field on ruzzian trench lines and fortifications.  Not a war crime.\n\nThey would be great for not just clearing trenches but also in attempting to clear minefields - if they can detonate some of the mines emplaced then it should make mine clearing easier.  A cluster munition fired on a grid is really not much different than the string munition fired by UR-77.\n\nOne instance where I can envision cluster munitions being used immediately is on some of the hedgerows that Ukraine is laboriously clearing both near Bakhmut and in the Zap/Kherson fronts.\n\nAlthough Ukraine feels that having this tool is important for operational flexibility I would suggest that of the items in the new package there are several that are more important - 64 additional Bradleys and Strykers, 31 more 155mm artillery, the AIM-7s, the other mine clearing equipment, almost 30 tactical tow vehicles for removing damaged equipment from the field, more tow missiles, and other items.   Not sure I would even rank the cluster shells in the top half dozen most impt items in the package.\n\nI have no doubt ruzzian gaslighting is off the charts across all media platforms at the moment.  They will be castigating the US decision in every way possible all the while hoping that the reader will forget the differences between the intended Ukrainian use scenarios on real ruzzian military targets and the many instances of actual use by ruzzia on Ukrainian civilian areas.

This involves criticism of the West at all costs, especially if it is even tangentially related to the American MIC. Basically hippies, progressives, and conservative isolationists. \n\nAnti-Ordinance activists seem to not understand that a clean-up will have to be done regardless, due to the Russians already using cluster munitions. It's the same bullshit logic they threw out at first to try and not help Ukraine (e.g. that Ukrainians are fascist Nazis that want to rid the world of POC, Jewish people, and the LGBTQ+ community). Obviously, this is embarrassing to Americans who actually pay attention to what is going on in the world. How people can inappropriately reference the tolerance paradox to non-violent stateside opposition and then vehemently oppose it when it comes to an actual Imperialist invasion is beyond me.

Go to art events and find something that speaks to you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou're so much better off buying one or two prices of artwork and getting them framed well, rather than spending 50-60 bucks every few years every times your tastes or locations change. Sure, it may be super expensive (Mine was 250+400 framed) but I'll keep that shit forever. It speaks to me.  \n\n\nThe framing was the most expensive thing (obviously), and I didn't have to get one directly from the artist, that was expensive too. But a real print is so much cooler than a print. It signifies appreciation for the art form rather than a slap dab attempt to just litter your walls with 'artistic' stuff'.\n\nPoint is, what speaks to you? Don't ask others what defines you.

We encourage the entire community to participate. Help with whatever it is you can, be it placing pixels at regular intervals, defending and rebuilding when the design gets attacked, bringing in allies, making designs which are fun bt easy to make, creating overlays to help the others know where to place what colour and so on.

The boundaries are intentionally breaking neighborhoods, in order to minimize or discourage school, local, state, and federal election participation. \n\nThe SC made no statement about the undo burden it placed on citizens to register, the division of communities, the lack of representation, and argued as long as voters have the right to change their mind, no election interference occurred. The members of the Supreme Court were literally too stupid to understand, reflect on, and process the statistical information given to them and did not engage with it at all.\n\nMay Wisconsin have a better day, with better justices.",

Any \"good\" ones have left the party to become IND (which also means career ending.) \n\nIt is our responsibility and duty to vote consistently and diligently IN EVERY LOCAL, STATE, NATIONAL election for the remainder of our lives and maintaining a 70% voter turnout. (Although higher is better.) \n\nHelp ensure that anyone you know who is a registered voter (or help them register if they're not) is held accountable each election day. Help them get to their polling place. Remind them what's at stake if they flake out. And familiarize yourself with federal, state, and local election provisions.\n\nRepublican christofacists have created this hell simply by prioritizing standing in a line and casting a vote. The most effective weapon we have to combat them is to do the same and in insurmountable volume.

Especially since we\u2019re talking about closer margins in individual districts, the surge doesn\u2019t have to even be all that big.

The whole thing was well-prepared obviously, but still very dangerous. On the first attempt, they realized that even on idle thrust, four engines produced too much thrust for them to slow down enough to make the landing. So they went around and switched two engines off before touchdown. Also the fact that you could engage the reversers in flight helped massively - to avoid the spool-up time of the reverse, they set the engines to reverse at around 200 ft above ground. \n\nThe pilot went on to fly for a tourist airline and in the 1990s, wrestled a would-be aircraft hijacker for 10 minutes or so (in the cockpit). Now mind you, Kallbach is tiny, standing at around 170cm and weighing maybe 65kg at most. Yet he prevailed and saved the aircraft from being hijacked.

The subterranean shunning grounds was my least favourite place, all claustrophobic, winding and maze-like in places.

Then you close in and see bodies hanging from everywhere, with albianurics having gone insane and attacking you, and the only sane one you meet is terrified out of his mind. And later you learn that Gideon just casually massacred the whole village to find the medallion. I'm generally not a big fan of Liurnia, but this along with the Ruin-Strewn Precipice are the ones I always look forward to.",

But the catacombs with those goddamn little gargoyle dudes.... Always from the shadows. I could live without them. They are terrifying to me.\n\nOh.. and the worm faces.",
                "The Gaol Cave in Caelid felt the most like a proper horror moment in the game. That said, for a game as vast and diverse as Elden Ring, I was disappointed that it never went full horror. FromSoft is so good at being spooky, they should do it more often.",
                "Yellow Anyx Tunnel's boss arena.",
                "Grafting room in Stormveil was pretty great",
                "The grafting room in Stormveil Castle\n\nOther than that the room in the Subterranean Shunning Ground with the Royal Revenant, it's just disgusting. \n\nThen also the underground genocide area against the caravan of merchants. Freaking tomb, locked them in alive, it makes your heart drop into your stomach",
                "For me, it\u2019s all of Caelid. As soon as you enter the region, you can immediately tell that something is horribly wrong. The sky is bright red and the music consists of this droning sound that evokes the sound of insects, as well as growls and snarls accompanying the drone. Caelid is covered in giant mushrooms, piles of burning corpses (some of which get back up), and pools of filthy water that will poison you. The dogs and birds that were presumably native to the region have all been transformed into malformed monstrosities, and near the Swamp of Aeonia are packs of the centipede-like Kindred of Rot as well as crazy people that worship the Scarlet Rot and have taken to adorning themselves with mushrooms. Beyond the Swamp of Aeonia is the literal ghost town of Sellia, and further beyond this is Greyoll\u2019s Dragonbarrow and the Bestial Sanctum that seems to have once been a part of Farum Azula. \n\nThis is not to mention that an average player\u2019s first time being in Caelid probably resulted from springing the trap chest in Limgrave and subsequently being trapped in if I remember correctly the Sellia Crystal Tunnel; which is full of enemies that are scaled to a higher rune level than the player is presumably currently at. Once the player does leave the tunnel, they are met with the bright red sky and the Swamp of Aeonia. All of this creates a horribly delicious feeling of dread.\n\nAnd from this [video](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxWYMmqfu2BqAbFrE2gKZiWy81-Iio_8ck), I like this person\u2019s reading that Caelid (specifically looking at the War-Dead Catacombs) is a commentary on how war and violence is a vicious cycle that erodes the body and mind like a disease. After all, everything that has happened to Caelid is a result of the fight between General Radahn and Malenia.",

                "For me it\u2019s the woods in Altus Plateaus where the Wormfaces are. I never go there.",
                "terrifying in terms of having to go through it is farum azula, terrifying in terms of theme id either say caria manor, lake of rot, or lyndell sewers.",

They caught us.\n\nVolcano Manor for their screaming frenzy Albinaurics. I really hated that room. I took that personally.\n\nLower ground of the Haligtree because of the royal Revenants. For a place filled either holy damage they feel right at home.\n\nMistwood because of rhe Rune Bears. If patches teleports you and you are unprepared you will die if they aggro.\n\nLower Altus Plateau with the high infection of wormfaces. Death has never been so disgusting.",
                "I think it was Ainsel River where I first met the giant ants, and something about the surprise of seeing them and then having to look at them up close really unnerved me. All the hair, and the nasty looking stingers. \ud83e\udd2e I wouldn't call it terrifying exactly, but I cut through that area as fast as I could just to be somewhere they weren't",
                "I was just wondering this myself actually. I would have to say Caelid, anytime of day but the area where the night Calvary roams. There is a dragon not too far, huge flesh eating birds, giant dogs, rotty rot, skitty creepy bug dudes with spears that shoot homing threads, etc. I stumbled in there by accident and it definitely had my b/p a little high",

His book value is around 26.6m so selling him for 30 means <4m profit.\n* Our bigger priority is midfield and I would argue RW.\n* Todibo and Pavard are being brought in to cover Varane. Neither of which are better. Todibo may get better but they are not elite talents. We should be going for an elite talent to take over. Once the prices were being driven up to 40m, it means our other signings suffer\n* I do think some of the news reports like from Neil Cutis of the sun saying Maguire is demanding 10m to pay him off is purely BS. Making stuff up cos he knows it gonna get traction for a controversial figure. He also said that Maguire was pissed off by the 20m bid cos he thought higher of himself\n* I do think this is a move to save funds and upgrade the midfield and get quality next season\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI dont want him at United but reality is the cost of replacing and the need for a midfielder takes priority.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust as yourself would you rather have midfield improvements or Varane cover",

I\u2018d take Lindelof over Pavard everyday and Mart\u00ednez/Varane as 1st choice is good as well.

If you don\u2019t have stains you\u2019re trying to remove, then adding more soap is hurting more than helping.

My house was built in 1991 and that had probably never been done .... So the wet dirt from the padding kept coming back up over and over again. Decades of under-carpet stains coming up. They kept coming back to clean it. Owner then said they never should have offered a deep pull-up on carpet that old from multiple users. Docked 100% of the cost, but still.  We put in hardwoods after that haha.",

Steaming it repeatedly can soak/oversaturate the padding and cause it to be unable to dry properly. When that happens it can start to mold under your carpet due to the prolonged moisture.  \n\nMake sure you let the carpet fully dry in between washes.",

You need a commercial one(you can rent it at home depot) or to hire a company. What happens is the water gets put down and the dirt gets pushed out(think to the side not up into the carpet). And then what isn't removed by the machine,wicks up through the fibers. The home depot one is what I used for a while when my portable machines motor went out. You should be able to touch the carpet and your hand be mostly dry if you rub your fingers together 2 or 3 times.  Tacky wet is fine,and will dry fine but can still wick.  Esp if any of that was urine or pet related.  I hope I explained this decently, im pretty tired haha.   Good luck to you!",

There's just too much of it to get all at once.\nIt's easier if you divide a room into chunks and focus on one or two at a time, but if it's a small room you can really do the whole thing each pass. \nBUT, like others have said, it's super important to do a pass of plain water after cleaning a section. Leaving excess cleaning solution in the carpet can theoretically cause make the carpet and bristles of the brush tackier and thus collect more dirt.

The deal was supposed to be that they would get it move in ready for me. It was not. Not even close. It was bad, so bad that the first carpet cleaning company I called wouldn't even touch it because they said it wouldn't make enough of a difference. They gave me info on an industrial carpet cleaning business and those guys showed up with a big truck and all sorts of equipment. They managed to get the carpet looking reasonably clean but warned me that this was still a surface clean, and within a few months the dirt underneath will end up rising back up and becoming visible. They were not wrong. So at that point my landlord loaned me their Big Green carpet cleaner machine thing and I did several passes of the entire house. And yep, disgusting black water over and over. I never actually got it clean, it would have taken months of constantly cleaning to get there. So I gave up and started putting down area rugs in the areas I actually spend time in or that get heavy traffic. It sucks but I didn't see any other option. This way the spaces that I would like to be able to sit on the floor on like my living area and the heavy traffic areas that would end up getting dirty quickly from foot traffic helping the dirt rise up from underneath to the surface again are covered.

We also grabbed a tent out of our garage. A lantern and his old fishing equipment.\n\nThe rent in our area is so high that it will take him two pay periods while living out s tent and trying to shower ay our local gym.  I'm looking for a any job with hours similar to him to maybe speed this up.  \n\nThe reason our house was deemed unlivable was from flood damage.  We only had one shop vac trying to win the battle and ran a dehumidifier to try and save our place.\n\nWe took all our valuables to a few different pawn shops and was able to buy gas for his car, a small stove to cook on and quality flashlights and two portable phone batteries.  This alone turned into an argument becauuse he wanted us to pawn our wedding bands but he wouldn't pawn his late fathers camera equipment.  They were both too sentimental to us.

                "We were flooded out in Isabel; our home was condemned.  This is how we handled it.  We bleached out our garage and set it up as a home base.  We set up a stove and refrigerator in there along with a TV and bed.  FEMA was of little help.  We had flood insurance thank goodness.  After they inspected, we started demo immediately.  We lived on premises the entire time.  Just because your house is condemned you don't have to abandon your property.   You can still use your appliances if you hurry up and clean them out and bleach them.  Insurance will replace them, but you can use them (if they work) until then.  You can use your propane grill; your water will still work.  This is all manageable. If you abandon your property, you are opening the door for looting.  Set up your tent in your yard if need be.",

Be sure to factor in how him on paper being and filing as single will effect other things but right now it\u2019s about survival. \n\nFind a women\u2019s shelter and see what assistance they have to offer. You don\u2019t have to stay to get help. \n\nFind food banks and little free pantries. Places like churches and libraries sometimes serve meals. Dumpster diving gets a bad rap but there is so much good food wasted daily you\u2019d be doing the word a favor saving a little of it. Watch some YT videos to learn the truth about expiration dates and you\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWhen I worked food service I had a few people come in and ask for a meal. I never said no. Mom and pop shops are a better bet but there are good people at big chain places too. \n\nStart propagating food baring plants in 5 gallon buckets. You can get them free at places that serve pickles. Panera is always happy to save me some. Then you have free food and they\u2019re portable. It takes a little time to establish but it can help in the long run. Plants can be started from food scraps or seeds from your already purchased produce. \n\nYou need to go break into the house and get what you need. Be sure to wear a respirator and clean everything thoroughly. Camp in the yard. You don\u2019t need to leave until the cops show up and make you. Very unlikely in an area that is still recovering from a disaster. \n\nA cheap start up that doesn\u2019t require a car is spraying numbers on curbs. It\u2019s only a couple cans of paint and stencil set. Check YT to learn how but it\u2019s super easy. Go door to door offering to do their curb for a $15/20 donation. When you can afford a stencil set of designs like flags, sports teams and such you can up change $10 for the graphic. \n\nAlso check your local libraries. Each offers different things but they have way more than books now. Lending libraries have tons of things to side hustle with. Creator and maker spaces are also great resources. \n\nI hope this helps. Good luck and stay safe \ud83e\udd19\ud83c\udffb",

WIC pays for food for you now while you\u2019re pregnant and you and the baby after he/she is born.

You don\u2019t need to belong to a parish and you don\u2019t even have to be Catholic or even a Christian or religious at all. They won\u2019t bring up religion to you or force you or guilt you into attending their church. I say this as a non Catholic who has sent many people in my community to get help with the red tape of social services and also used them to help me get my disabled dad started with the red tape of disability services.\n\nWhat they do is meet with you and help determine what you will qualify for before you go to social services and stand in line for hours just to be told no. They have forms already there as well so you can get them in advance and fill them out before you go to social services and they know what things you can sign up for online . They can also direct you to the nearest food bank and know about other services for food. For example, where I live, there\u2019s a large charity that delivers food to your door step. \n\nThey can also let you know about emergency housing.",

Most of his 10/10 performances were really just functionally good performances, one or two truly excellent, and it also suggests he flipped between the good and terrible equally when he was more prone to cocking up than he was taking the game in hand.\n\nAs for the \"giving it 100%\" narrative, again I feel differently. He ran, no argument, but giving it your all isn't just about that. It's about working hard on your flaws, like his shocking inconsistency, day in/day out in training, which I don't think we saw. Yeah he was jolly, and you need light hearted characters, but one's who still have a winning mentality which I never really got from him.\n\nAll in all I wish him well but I'm delighted he's moving on. Hope he has a great time in Turkey and plays well, but Utd needed to stop relying on him, even as a squad player, as he was just far too unreliable.",

He had a tough transition initially, but he has really improved over the last couple of seasons, and while he lost his place as a starter, he was a great bundle of energy and pressing to bring on during the closing stages, chasing balls down and nipping at the opposition midfielders. I feel like the negative feelings towards the McFred pivot has also rubbed off on his stock at the club, but IMO Fred was a more consistent and more useful player to have in midfield out of the two, and I for one am very disappointed to see Fred go. He would have been a very good option in midfield as backup, especially with Donny and McT also expected to leave, with the number of reds Case picks up, and with Eriksen also aging.",

I was struggling in math, and it didn't help that my math teacher sucked at teaching and was mega inappropriate in a multitude of ways. He was very outspoken, as in he wasn't afraid to humiliate you in front of everyone. \n\nFor example, if a girl walked in wearing shorts and a tank top, the first thing he'd say to her is \"well someone's dressed like a whore today\". He would call kids dumbasses, embarrass them in the middle of our lesson, called you names, etc. He even did it to me a few times.\n\nAnyways, since I was struggling in his class, my mom set up a private parent-teacher conference with him. They talked about it and set it up weeks in advanced. The day before the meeting, this teacher called me out in front of everyone. \n\n\"Your mommy is coming tomorrow for our conference, are you ready for it?\" He said in a very smug way. \n\nI told him this was no one's business to know, and if he wanted to talk to me about it, call me over to his desk, not discuss it in front of everyone. But the bastard only laughed at me and proceeded to say how he's dealt with many one on one conferences with students and their parents and that my \"mommy won't scare him\". That's when I laughed and told him \"yeah, we'll see about that\". Of course he didn't take me seriously, and let me and everyone else in the class know that my \"mommy\" wouldn't get to him. \n\nBut here's the thing my teacher did not know about my mother. Not only is she stern, but she's also a cop. \n\nSo the next day, my mom walks onto campus in her full uniform since she had to go straight to work after our meeting. Meaning she was in her bullet proof vest, had her gun on her, handcuffs, everything. The whole police ensemble. When we walked in, he immediately crumbled.\n\n\"Hello (mom's name), I'm Mr. Asshole\" \n\nMy mom shot him down immediately and said \"you can call me officer (our last name)\". \n\nHe was speechless already. He sat us down at the desks, but Mr. Asshole already fucked up. Every morning, his class was open to students trying to finish math homework. And this day was no different. There were kids in the room before school started and my mom was PISSED about it. We didn't even start the actual conference, and my mom stated she had a question before we got started. \n\n\"Why the fuck are there other kids in here?\" \n\nMr. Asshole, still obviously intimidated, said it was so they could finish any math homework they had. My mom was not having it.\n\n\"We've had this conference scheduled for weeks. These kids don't need to hear the issues my kid is having with you. So why the fuck are they in here during a private meeting?\" \n\nHe proceeded to kick the kids out. He was on his toes the entire time. There was no fooling around, no snide comments, nothing. This was the most serious i had ever seen him. It was glorious. He was visibly intimidated by my mom, and it was the best feeling. \n\nLater on in the day, when it was my class period with him, he immediately made sure I understood everything. I knew when the test was, I understood the material, etc, because \"I do not want your mom coming back here and chewing my ass out again\". All the kids in class were surprised because of how smug he was the day before, and to how he was acting now. He wanted to make sure my mom was not coming back for another conference, and admitted that \"she's a scary woman\". \n\nThe sorry bastard left me alone for the rest of the school year and made sure I knew the material enough to pass. As long as my mom didn't come back. Gave me the best feeling \ud83d\ude02 \n\n(Side note: it was known to the school how inappropriate he was with students. There were many complaints against him including some from my mom, he never got fired because he was the only tennis coach and the school didn't want to find / hire a new coach)",

Now my principal was a 4\u201910\u201d Pentecostal woman and a preacher, she refused to let me and my brother take pictures on pic day because we had mustaches. We were bout 12-13 years old and my mom already paid for everything months before. We came home told her principal wouldn\u2019t let us take pics unless we shaved our mustaches, my mom was furious. Next morning she brought us to school. She barged in the principal\u2019s office with a cigarette in her mouth and lit in this woman\u2019s ass cussed her for everything she was worth, thumped her cigarette at her and lite another.

I was confused, but she was furious--not at me.\n\nNext morning for some reason the teacher decides to call my mom again and my mom *ripped into her.* Apparently really pressed some of her buttons with things like, \"Why are you teaching kids if you hate them?\" She told me later, \"Well, she started dishing it out so I dished it right back.\"\n\nI didn't find out until after school from my mom, but I knew something had gone down.

Some dress code things but they were 100% bs and I used the handbook to prove it. Some male teachers are just fucking assholes to feed their ego.

He always talked about himself and his family, always talked down to everyone, and encouraged people to \"debate\" him. If he was losing the debate, he sent you to the office. He was a staunch conservative that always had something to say about society, gay people, etc. He was offensive at one point about the area where I'm from because he claimed they were all poor, stupid and lost all their teeth to soda.\n\nHe never got in trouble because he had tenure. Even the other teachers couldn't stand him. People who went to the office from his class rarely got in actual trouble.\n\nHe ended up leaving his wife and kids for another man.

There is no reason there shouldn't be some sort of clause to prevent this kind of situation.  And the excuse of being short handed is just that and excuse.  Any person who acts this way should not be allowed around children in any situation.\n\nCongrats on the well deserved petty revenge.",

Unfortunately this was happening when phones with cameras were not so common. Years after I graduated a girl caught him on camera and sent the video to the local TV station.

This is so that I can show them that I am moving it up or down a few feet, or to the other side of the aisle to make room for additional bags.

I know it was stolen because it was in a clear duty free bag with a receipt noting my boarding ticket info/name- and showed exactly what was in it (worth about $400 usd) and could not have been mistaken for something nondescript. It was some duty free stuff I had purchased right before getting on the plane- had it in my hands for all of 45 min while boarding and getting it in to the compartment. It was not moved or opened until it was time to get off- by the time I got to the aisle everyone from my row had gotten moving off the plane. I know now not to trust the overhead bins to be 100% secure for certain things and to be very aware of the folks around me. Kicker- there is zero way to claim a loss for stolen carry ons.

And I would love if the movie or end of the movie sets Goten and Trunks up to get God Ki and follow the God Ki route and I would also love it if the end of the movie also makes Janemba canon and sets Janemba up to be a main villain for a potentially big saga that\u2019s after the movie.",

By the time Flamininus (a full-on Greekoid weeb) marched the legions into Greece, the Roman aristocracy was completely Hellenized. \n\nGreekification began over a century before Roman annexation of the Greek city states with the conquest of southern Italy. This is where the Greek influences on Roman culture came from. The whole of southern Italy was settled by Greeks. \n\nNaples was still a Greek-speaking city during the reign of Nero. This was 400 years after Naples had been conquered by Rome. \n\nIn the Middle Ages, the Byzantine Empire held on to southern Italy but failed to conquer the north partly because the north was occupied by Germanic Lombards while the south was still dominated by Greeks. \n\nTo this very day, there are still ethnic Greek speakers in southern Italy around Calabria who can trace their lineage all the way back to Antiquity.",

Ubers to Chelsea/Kensington/Richmond are less than \u00a310! It\u2019s a leafy suburb that feels out of London but you\u2019re right in the midst of it. Most importantly it\u2019s SAFE. I\u2019ve walked home from the tube in the early hours of the morning alone and not once have I felt anxious. \n\nAbundance of restaurants, boutique shops, cafes, parks. Westfield is literally on your doorstep. It\u2019s not a late night party location like the East but it has a lot going on regardless, also have Brentford football club which are arguably the best West London team now.\n\nIt\u2019s one of my favourite places in London and will most likely stay that way due to the multitude of reasons above. It also never gets the  super busyness of more well known places. I would highly recommend if you can afford it.",

I know people that live in Chiswick now that they're in their 40's but they certainly wouldn't have lived there in their 20's. Aside from the fact that they wouldn't have been able to afford it, it's not a happening or exciting part of town. Yes it's very nice but it might also feel pretty dull, depending on the stage of life you're at and what you're into. Picture wandering around pleasant parks and along the river, in amongst convoys of expensive prams. Enjoying a quiet pint of real ale in a lovely old pub. Perfect for some, but not everyone. \n\nPlaces like Shoreditch and Clapham are more central, more lively and serve a different, younger demographic.

            "selftext": "There are two girls that have joined my company recently in my team. I (M) was told to back them up, to train them, help them get familiar until official training session began for them under team leads. Owing to my fun personality we all gelled up pretty quick. Following expert suggestions I do try keeping official relations and personal relations away, but one of the girl (a fresher) appears to be too touchy (not in a bad way) just touchy in general. She wouldn't touch me in inappropriately but she comes too close than usual. I can sense it that she has kind of breached my personal space. Consent is off for a toss. She would often pull my hands to take me somewhere, would touch my hair, would pull my jacket to make me explain her a doubt, would bring her face too close to mine when I'm explaining her a particular process on laptop, would literally, totally lean on my chest to show dance reels of her on her phone, would touch her knees to mine and many more. One day, I was working from home, and she was at office, we were connected on Zoom, and she was sharing her screen because I was explaining her a problem. Once the explanation was over, she asks me to look at her screen in a very soft voice, I looked, and she types on notepad, *\"Do you have a girlfriend?\"*. Now, this took me off guard because I can never even think of asking such personal questions to any of my female office colleagues. \n\nNow the problem is I am unable to decide if this is harassment or if she's just being friendly and this is her personality. Because bottom line, I'm not finding it offensive but rather adorable, yes! (She doesn't touch me inappropriately) I kinda find it cute that women around me get so comfortable that they express themselves and their vulnerabilities. But the matter of consent on physical touch is also not there. I have never explicitly told her that she can touch me. I dont know how to view it. Is this wrong? should I go ahead and file a POSH complaint.",

The same evening I got a call from HR(happened to be a woman) asking for an explanation! I was honest with her and explained whatever happened without filters. Later I was terminated from the company on the grounds of sexual harassment and they are ready to offer me the remaining compensation for the rest of training period only after a written apology to her.

She didn't care about how she would be going home, who would drop her nothing. Just got shit drunk and then people were scrambling who would take her home.\n\nMy 2 cents even if you like her this is not the way to go about. It's unprofessional her behaviour.

                "ADVICE AT THE END. The person was a higher level male employee in my(24F) case and I did not shy away. I escalated it and filed an official complaint. But all of these stories start like this, trust me. You never know to what level will it escalate. \n\nSince women are generally more vulnerable to these, we identify the threat and it's scalability immediately. Men, even if uncomfortable, try to label it as extra friendliness and innocence because deep down they find it hard to label fresher girls as evil. So OP, my advice, if she is actually evil, it will backtrack to you VERY HARD and then nobody will defend you because you are a guy. \n\nUsually I agree with Redditors, but here, I don't. This is not college anymore. From my personal work and sexual harassment case, I have an advice - You are in danger and if she doesn't take a no, and is not as innocent as it seems, you may find yourself in deep shit. For starters, example, if you do file a POSH hypothetically, do you think she will accept that she did those things? Never. Everyone lies once some harassment case starts. And the moment she lies, you are done for. Being a woman, she probably doesn't even need proof if your organisation has a strict HR. Because in these matters, reputable companies don't want to take a verbal _She is lying, I'm the innocent guy._ over their own reputation. From a business pov, they don't care whether or not you are innocent, they'll just rip out the roots of everything - and mostly it is the guy who faces the consequences because just in case the girl is actually innocent, company may be in deep shit again. Everything boils down to reputation. \n\nI have suffered mentally for long due to these incidents at my workplace. \n\nADVICE: The best thing you can do to save yourself in the future is collect evidence. Everytime she does something like this, record it. Also, record yourself sternly telling her to stop this. This is extremely important. Start making a note of what she did and said _including the date_ it happened on. Try to recall something else that happened that day, maybe you there was some important meeting you had attended, trace the date in the work email, but list out all of them. \n\nEven after doing all these, I heard shit about myself from another higher level person because the HR policies were bad and my harasser was also a higher level person. I heard that \"you never stopped him the beginning - because you enjoyed the limelight under that person and his attention\". Now if a girl can hear this, why can't you? I had inhibitions in the beginning and I was scared- that's why I couldn't stop him. I didn't know how to! I was alone and very very new at the office. And aren't you doubting the fact she is evil?ofc you can hear these things too. \nBut in the end, proof wins. So I survived. Sorry to say OP, but it'll be more difficult for you even with proof because you are a guy. Having proof is the least you can do for now. If she goes berserk, _you shouldn't_ suffer. Make sure of that. If she doesn't, fine. \n\n\nALWAYS KEEP PROOF, FELLOW REDDITORS.",

                "This is a complex situation with nuances on both sides. Here are some considerations:\n\nHer behavior:\n\n\u2022 Touching without consent is problematic. Even if not intended sexually, unwanted physical contact is a form of harassment.\n\n\u2022 Her personal questions were unprofessional and cross boundaries.\n\n\u2022 Some of her behavior, like leaning on your chest, is clearly inappropriate for the workplace.\n\n\u2022 However, she may not realize her behavior is making you uncomfortable since you haven't explicitly told her. She could be misreading cues.\n\nYour response:\n\n\u2022 You haven't asked her to stop or set boundaries, so she may not realize her behavior is an issue for you.\n\n\u2022 While you don't find it offensive, her behavior could create legal risks for the company if not addressed properly.\n\n\u2022 Filing a formal complaint right away could be extreme without first talking to her.\n\nNext steps:\n\n\u2022 Have a private conversation with her and explain that while you appreciate her friendly personality, certain physical contact and personal questions make you uncomfortable and you'd like her to stop.\n\n\u2022 Set clear expectations for professionalism and appropriate workplace interactions going forward.\n\n\u2022 Suggest other ways she can engage with you professionally.\n\n\u2022 Give her the benefit of the doubt that she didn't realize her behavior was an issue. But make it clear you need it to change.\n\n\u2022 Document your conversation in case her behavior continues. Then involve HR if needed.\n\n\u2022 Filing a complaint should only happen as a last resort if your direct communication fails and the behavior continues after you explicitly ask her to stop.\n\nThe key is to have an open, honest conversation from a place of mutual understanding and respect. Hopefully this will allow you both to move forward professionally in a positive way. Let me know if you have any other questions.",

A man is given the right to make his version of the story heard under POSH, but we know that once there's a POSH complaint against a man, there is very little chance that it will go in his favour.\n\nMany firms these days have gender neutral policies to prevent sexual harassment. Check with the policies of your firm. You can file a complaint against her (if you want to) even if she doesn't touch you inappropriately, because what she's doing to you can be interpreted as hostile work environment (as defined in the POSH Act).\n\nBesides recording her actions, I'd also suggest keeping a witness to some of her actions wherever it is plausible. If you choose to talk to her about her making you uncomfortable, consider making a voice record of the conversation, and if plausible, have a witness for the same. However, I wouldn't recommend talking to her directly, because the POSH Act dictates that one of the ways in which a complaint can be resolved is through reconciliation between complainant and respondent in presence of the ICC, which acts as the official witness. The Act never mentions telling the person no as a method of resolution. \n\nFinally, do keep the HR in loop of what's happening or what happens from now. As someone mentioned, HR doesn't want complaints to be filed in the first place. Let them do what is necessary. However, do this only if you think your HR is just and effective enough.

WE MADE BOYKISSER HAPPEN!\n\nHey everyone, as you can see r/place is back!\n\nLast time around our small project on the canvas quickly escalated into a massive alliance with dozens of members. We managed to fight off the void, survived being destroyed by streamers multiple times and held our ground against entire countries!\n\nThis year we're bringing the alliance back. Lots of effort has been put into making things run more smoothly this time and make it even greater.\n\nWe understand that spirits might be a bit low given the recent events on reddit but that doesn't mean that we can't have a little fun anyways (*and maybe help to make this a place that reddit certainly will remember for a loooong time*)\n\nSo buckle up and get your pixels ready!\n\n# Join the alliance discord [https://discord.gg/aVamu4q8MH](https://discord.gg/aVamu4q8MH) ! We have a channel for the furry_irl members prepared.\n\n# You can find the current template here:\n\n[https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1118950293758017646/1132781252282429561/template.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1118950293758017646/1132781252282429561/template.png)\n\n# The coordinates are (-1092,193)\n\n**How to get the alliance overlay: (**[**https://discord.com/channels/960158595952050236/1092487868582219887/1131970598298468382**](https://discord.com/channels/960158595952050236/1092487868582219887/1131970598298468382)**)**\n\nGetting the alliance overlay is just 3 simple steps.\n\n1.\tInstall tampermonkey to your browser [https://www.tampermonkey.net/](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)\n2.\tInstall the overlayscript. Go here [https://github.com/osuplace/templateManager/raw/main/dist/templateManager.user.js](https://github.com/osuplace/templateManager/raw/main/dist/templateManager.user.js) and click \u201cconfirm installation\u201d.\n3.\tGo to place and click on the little white square with the sliders, if it isn't there just reload the page until it is. In the box that shows up in the lower box paste this link: [https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Furryirlburner1/09ce4195fada18db6dc5e32e30a8e34b/raw](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Furryirlburner1/09ce4195fada18db6dc5e32e30a8e34b/raw) and hit `Always Load`.\n\nnote: We are uploading a single, merged template to the overlay instead of multiple small ones. This is to make it easier for alliance members, reduce the overall maintenance effort, ensure coordination and make it easier to run a bot (should we be able to get it running)\n\nIf you need more info on how to use the script see here [https://docs.google.com/document/d/12WTiDcRo4P35zJvlgWX06MKVbitbDo3ehnF7mysFv4Y/edit?rm=minimal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12WTiDcRo4P35zJvlgWX06MKVbitbDo3ehnF7mysFv4Y/edit?rm=minimal)",

Ollie has a son, Will (7) that he shares with his ex, while Lisa has a daughter, Nia (8) from her previous relationship. I have a daughter, Sienna (6). \n\nOver the past few weeks, I\u2019ve taken the kids out numerous places. The way it has always worked when I\u2019ve babysat Will is I take the kids out and then when I bring Will back I give Ollie or his ex an approximate cost for anything I bought while out and they pay me back. Obviously this is not a hard and fast rule, sometimes I will tell them not to worry about it if I\u2019ve bought lunch or small souvenirs but if Will comes back with something big, normally Ollie is insistent on paying me back for it. This works the same the other way round.\n\nI thought this would work the same with Lisa, but so far it hasn\u2019t. Since this holiday, and actually over the two years I\u2019ve known her, it either takes her a long time and several nagging reminders from my brother for her to pay me back, or she just doesn\u2019t. She will try to negotiate paying only a fraction of what is owed, saying she doesn\u2019t have the money and trying to make the costs my fault ie. Saying I should have taken the kids to fast food place instead of a restaurant. This has begun to get very irritating and I have found myself offering to take the kids out less because navigating the money with Lisa has become so awkward.\n\nMy husband and I are meant to take the kids out tomorrow, so last night I took Lisa aside and said to avoid any awkwardness, she should give me or Nia the amount of money she is happy to spend on the day upfront. That way, I know in advance what a comfortable budget is for her, and she doesn\u2019t have to worry about paying me back afterwards. Lisa got very offended and accused me of favouring the bio kids and singling out Nia. I said this had nothing to do with Nia, just Lisa herself, and that I was not happy to subsidise everything that Lisa doesn\u2019t feel like paying for after the fact. Lisa said this won\u2019t be fair because Nia won\u2019t be able to afford the souvenirs the other kids are getting and I said \u201cLisa you can\u2019t afford them now either, *I\u2019m* the one paying for everything\u201d. Lisa got very upset and said she would just pull Nia from the day out. \n\nMy husband says I did the right thing, my brother says I should have just been a bit stricter with Lisa about having to cough up and not asked her for the money upfront. I feel bad because now Nia is going to miss out on the outing and Ollie and Lisa don\u2019t get to spend the day alone but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair for me to have to ask Lisa 7 times for money I spent on her kid. AITA?\n\nEdit: Ollie and Lisa keep their finances entirely separate, and they don\u2019t pay for each other\u2019s kids. I was trying to be respectful of that by going to Lisa directly, because while Ollie does nudge Lisa to pay me back, I didn\u2019t think it was prudent to be asking him to pay me for Nia\u2019s expenses, knowing that that is not how they choose to do things.",

Asking for the money upfront *is* being strict. And your brother should not be leaving this up to you.\n\nAnd yes, Lisa has been taking advantage of your generosity of time and money. She knows you\u2019re a good parent and aunt and hopes you\u2019ll be guilted into continuing to pay. It is horrible to have to repeatedly ask someone for money when they ought to automatically hand it over. \n\n As is so often the case, no good deed goes unpunished. NTA.",

                "NTA, but talk to your brother as well. He may be willing to cover Nia's costs and /or speak to Lisa directly.\n\nETA - just saw he is suggesting you should be 'stricter' - no, you shouldn't have to chase Lisa up, you've been doing her a favour and the least she can do is pay up the first time she is asked. IF he isn't comfortable with you asking for money up front he's free to cover his partner's expense and then he can be 'strict' with her about getting  refunded. I'd actually propose that to him, so he can take the responsibility for getting money out of his partner.",

I feel bad for the kid, hopefully she'll come round to the (very workable) solution of paying up front.",

                "NTA.\n\nYou're already doing Lisa a huge favour by bringing Nia out on fun excursions and providing free childcare, essentially. It's not on you to bear the cost of every outing (obviously small gifts now and then are nice, but NOT EVERY MEAL).",
                "NTA. Although it\u2019s a little ESH-ish, since this has happened more than once she\u2019s more to blame for not being proactive about this conversation.\n\nOn your end: IMO it\u2019s not appropriate to create a (variable, uncapped, non-emergency) debt for someone without their permission, and get upset when they don\u2019t pay it back according to your timeline. You and Ollie have created a blank check financial arrangement (that he initiated), where he pays you back for the (non-essential, non-emergency) things you choose to pay for for his kid, and that arrangement works for his financial situation. Maybe he has more money and so this type of open tab makes sense. You *assumed* that arrangement also would work for Lisa, but you didn\u2019t confirm that with her before you started racking up a tab for her, and then you get upset at her after the fact. That\u2019s not fair. She may in fact be in a more limited financial situation and not be able to afford what you\u2019re asking her to pay, and you didn\u2019t check with her before you decided to spend. Generally speaking: If I voluntarily choose to spend on someone without an advance agreement on the amount and an agreement to pay me back, I view it as a gift and do not feel entitled to be paid back. \n\nHowever: bc this was more than a one time occurrence, she also should have taken initiative to be clear about her financial boundaries instead of being passive and having you repeatedly asking her for money back. Fundamentally you\u2019re trying to do a nice thing by creating fun, inclusive social bonding opportunities for her kid, and the way she\u2019s handling this doesn\u2019t recognize that. It doesn\u2019t seem like she\u2019s reciprocating with her own trips/outings either. That behavior is definitely entitled.\n\nShe does makes a valid point though, that the way you\u2019re suggesting to plan trips seems to be singling Nia out unnecessarily. If you are paying for things for the other two kids, but expecting Nia to carry money and pay for herself, IMO that\u2019s a very bizarre way to treat children. It would make much more sense for 1) every child to carry their own money (create a uniform policy), or imo even better 2) for you to ask Lisa for what budget is reasonable for her in advance and then plan trips within that budget for everyone. It would be totally fine to ask for payment in advance \u2014 would just be like any field trip.",
                "NTA\n\n Then she can keep her kid with her, problem solved.",
                "YTA, but honestly Ollie is the bigger AH.  If Ollie and Lisa are engaged, then there should be no more your kid/my kid on the small stuff.  There should only be Ollie and Nia are our kids, we pay for equal treatment on the small stuff.  You are Ollie\u2019s sister, you have a longstanding agreement with Ollie about paying for the kids\u2019 entertainment.  If Lisa can\u2019t afford the entertainment for Nia, Ollie should cover it.  That is his responsibility to his family-fianc\u00e9e and both kids.  That\u2019s the only way for Nia to feel welcomed and equal in the household and the extended family.",
                "What drives me the most crazy in this story is that your brother, OP, is just letting this happen. Why do *you* have to be strict with Lisa? Tell your brother to sort his fiancee out, why doesn't he contribute a few bucks himself to Nia's fun-fund on these outings? Doesn't matter if it's his bio kid, he's marrying Lisa!\n\nNTA.",
                "Info: Why not just ask your brother to pony up for both kids?",
                "NTA. What I am a little concerned about is that she has little money left over to pay for activities for her daughter when they share household expenses. Are those expenses split 50/50, and do they have comparable incomes? I am sure your brother would feel differently if their shared child and her child were the ones that could have activities, and he his other child excluded because he didn't have the funds. Blended families are difficult, and a marriage won't work if one of the children is excluded due to funds.",
                "NTA, Lisa is and to some extend your brother is too. He is going to marry this woman and yet he wouldn't even pay for some souvenirs for his future stepdaughter that her mum can't afford? Asking a sister to be stricter with his future wife? All of it sounds very weird and not like a relationship that will last, but it's not your problem, you've done nothing wrong.",
                "The only reason I\u2019m saying Nta is because you asked her to give an amount up front she is comfortable spending. Otherwise, yeah. When I take my nephews places, I pay. If I offer to get them souvenirs, I pay. If I take them out to eat, I pay. I picked the place, I picked the price point. Why would I expect them to retroactively cover something they didn\u2019t have a say in?",
                "Are you officially babysitting them, or are you taking the initiative and asking them to go places with you and your kid because you are a nice aunt and you want your kid to hang with their cousins? Did you discuss the activities ahead of time with the parents, or do you go do what you want then expect them to pay whatever the cost is?  Do they take your kid places and pay? Or is it always one sided? When we invite a friend along with our kid, we pay for the friend, and the other parents do the same when our kid goes with them. These are for small activities that cost less than $40-$50. Something bigger like a giant amusement park then parents would send along money. You aren\u2019t the AH, but they aren\u2019t either. Don\u2019t invite other kids along if you don\u2019t expect to pay for them. I\u2019ve never asked another parent or relative to pay me back when I took their kid to dinner.\n\nEdit: in your original post you say Lisa said she didn\u2019t have the money. You can\u2019t be mad at somebody who has less than you and can\u2019t keep up with your lifestyle. You should be mad at your brother for treating his fianc\u00e9 as a second class citizen instead of an equal partner. If your brother has the money and his soon to be life partner doesn\u2019t, then your brother is the AH, not you or Lisa!",
                "Your brother is the AH. He and Lisa are a couple and about to get married. Why is she on her own? They as a couple should fork out money for both kids. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA.",
                "Ollie says just ask her for the money .. you did. up front.   And unless she just doesn't want to pay, this shouldn't have been a problem.   \n\nAt some point this couple is going to have to consider pooling funds to pay for their upbringing so they see equity at this household.   \n\nNTA -  but Lisa and Ollie have some work to do to make BOTH kids feel equally important.",
                "The situation is that Nia\u2019s mom can\u2019t afford these outings. Let\u2019s think about what would be the most inclusive and kindest thing for these cousin relationships. It sounds like you have no problem paying for lunch or smaller expenses as these are paid for your daughter when another adult takes her on cousin time. Perhaps you\u2019re affording nicer places, but it\u2019s equitable as long as they all are eating. So the main issue seems to be buying souvenirs and toys. How about planning outings that aren\u2019t so consumeristic? I realize it\u2019s different from what\u2019s been done before, and you feel it saves you both trips, but there are a million things to do with kids that don\u2019t require buying new things. Free days at museums and zoos, going on nature walks, or low cost activities like getting an ice cream or chalking on the drive way etc. \n\nWhen I was a kid, my cousins were more well off than me and I had to go to the toy store with them many times and get nothing or something tiny compared to what they were getting. It doesn\u2019t feel good and neither does missing out on outings that they get to go on, which is what would happen if you only take the two cousins in future. \n\nI\u2019m going to say NAH as the communication breakdown has been on all sides, and you have tried, but it seems like YTA if you start excluding Nia from the excursions when there\u2019s every reason not to. \n\nIf there\u2019s expenses outside of typical lunch/food involved, then I\u2019d say either all cousins go or it\u2019s not a cousin outing, and that\u2019s really for your brother and Lisa to work out the financial aspect. Instituting an \u201cwe all agree to this budget\u201d ahead policy before telling the kids seems like the best approach.",

                "ESH\n\nHonestly this is such a weird situation to me. I can't imagine taking my nieces and nephews on a day out and asking my brother/sister to reimburse me. They're my family! If I wasn't willing to buy them lunch then I just wouldn't take them out. And if we're talking a much bigger purchase than lunch then why the hell would you allow a 7/8 year old to make such a big purchase, without consulting their parent first (whom you expect to pay for it)?!\n\nAnd now, rather than cancelling the trip you're going to let one kid miss out and make it clear to them that they're not a real part of the family. What did Nia do to deserve this?\n\nYour brother and his fiance have weird systems. I get that it's whatever works for them but now it's involving you which is not ok. He should pay for both of the kids and claim the money from Lisa if he cares. The burden shouldn't be on you.\n\nLisa shouldn't go into a system like this and then try and manipulate her way into not paying. If she's not willing or not able to pay then she should have discussed that with you not just try and get out of it.\n\nInfo: if Lisa had given you a small amount of money for Nia but the activities you'd planned cost more than that, what would you have done? Would you have shaped the activities to fit or just let Nia miss out?\n\nI feel bad for Nia most of all.\n\nI'm probably gonna get downvoted for this because Reddit is all about individual entitlement and quite anti-parents, but I stand by it.",

                "NAH, for now\n\nSeems to me there's a big social and/or cultural miscommunication here that I think will be hard to find compromise. \n\nLisa is of the mind that relatives who offer to spend time with her kid pay for all expenses while you feel that all expenses should be reimbursed by the parent. It's hard to find a medium ground because each side sees this situation very differently. \n\nUnfortunately, I think from now on you have to be very clear and set a new standard that if Lisa would like you to invite her kiddo then Lisa needs to give you the monetary budget before you leave with her kid OR if brother doesn't want to deal with the problems that might create, brother reimburses you for both kids. As awkward and crappy as that seems, you two are coming from very different points and compromise is the only way this can move forward if Lisa's daughter will also come along.",

The edit doesn't factor because without the brother OP would have nothing to do with Nia especially if OP entertaining both children gives him and his fiancee free time.

                "NTA, but I'm confused why it didn't seem to occur to any of the adults involved to talk to each other and work out a budget for these excursions in advance rather than always negotiating money that has already been spent.

This comment is NOT accusing you of copying anything. Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nMy (f33) brother Ollie (36), his fianc\u00e9 Lisa, and their kids are currently staying with my family for a holiday. Ollie has a son, Will (7) that he shares with his ex, while Lisa has a daughter, Nia (8) from her previous relationship. I have a daughter, Sienna (6). \n\nOver the past few weeks, I\u2019ve taken the kids out numerous places. The way it has always worked when I\u2019ve babysat Will is I take the kids out and then when I bring Will back I give Ollie or his ex an approximate cost for anything I bought while out and they pay me back. Obviously this is not a hard and fast rule, sometimes I will tell them not to worry about it if I\u2019ve bought lunch or small souvenirs but if Will comes back with something big, normally Ollie is insistent on paying me back for it. This works the same the other way round.\n\nI thought this would work the same with Lisa, but so far it hasn\u2019t. Since this holiday, and actually over the two years I\u2019ve known her, it either takes her a long time and several nagging reminders from my brother for her to pay me back, or she just doesn\u2019t. She will try to negotiate paying only a fraction of what is owed, saying she doesn\u2019t have the money and trying to make the costs my fault ie. Saying I should have taken the kids to fast food place instead of a restaurant. This has begun to get very irritating and I have found myself offering to take the kids out less because navigating the money with Lisa has become so awkward.\n\nMy husband and I are meant to take the kids out tomorrow, so last night I took Lisa aside and said to avoid any awkwardness, she should give me or Nia the amount of money she is happy to spend on the day upfront. That way, I know in advance what a comfortable budget is for her, and she doesn\u2019t have to worry about paying me back afterwards. Lisa got very offended and accused me of favouring the bio kids and singling out Nia. I said this had nothing to do with Nia, just Lisa herself, and that I was not happy to subsidise everything that Lisa doesn\u2019t feel like paying for after the fact. Lisa said this won\u2019t be fair because Nia won\u2019t be able to afford the souvenirs the other kids are getting and I said \u201cLisa you can\u2019t afford them now either, *I\u2019m* the one paying for everything\u201d. Lisa got very upset and said she would just pull Nia from the day out. \n\nMy husband says I did the right thing, my brother says I should have just been a bit stricter with Lisa about having to cough up and not asked her for the money upfront. I feel bad because now Nia is going to miss out on the outing and Ollie and Lisa don\u2019t get to spend the day alone but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair for me to have to ask Lisa 7 times for money I spent on her kid.

                "INFO: Does Lisa struggle financially? If yes, then I'm going with a soft ESH. Obviously the way she responded to you and has generally been taking advantage of your generosity, 100% makes her TA (and if she does not have financial issues, then you are definitely NTA). However the reason I'm a soft ESH is because I was the poor kid growing up in a wealthier town, and I was VERY aware of it. It was always awkward and uncomfortable when I would go out with friends and had a smaller budget. I would always order the cheapest food on the menu, or pretend I wasn't hungry, or if I was the one making the plans, I would suggest doing something at one of our houses or something very cheap that I could actually afford to kind of level the playing field so to speak. My point being that if Lisa does struggle financially and you know that some of the things you like to do with the kids are more expensive, you should be offering to do activities that she can actually afford. That way Nia doesn't have to get left out of the experience because her mom can't afford the activity or event you chose, or that way if she can go, she doesn't get an unequal experience (such as you buying your and your brother's kids expensive souvenirs and Nia only having a $20 budget). However if you do want to do the more expensive activities and want Nia to be able to go, you either need to be prepared to pick-up some of the tab, or encourage your brother to have a talk with Lisa about their finances, and for him to be willing to pay for these particular outings (since Nia is going to be his stepdaughter anyway). For example, one of my friends growing up brought me to Florida with her family over spring break one year. She and her brother were both allowed to invite a friend, and I just assumed (I was in middle school and still a little naive) that their parents were picking up the entire tab for everyone. However, when we were on our way there, I remember overhearing that the parents of the brother's friend had given my friend's parents over $700 to help cover his costs of the trip, yet my friend's parents never asked my mom or I to contribute anything. I was absolutely mortified at that point and tried to cost them as little money as possible, but they still made sure to include me in all the activities, and even encouraged me to do some when they could probably tell I was holding back because of the cost. My mom gave me as much spending money as she could, but it still wasn't much, so this family (even the grandparents) bought some fun things/souvenirs.\nAnyway, that's a long winded way of me trying to explain that while I do think the way you approached Lisa was respectful and with good intentions, from my experience of being poor, I think you could have potentially worded it a little differently, or should have talked to her before even planning the outing to find out what kind of activities she could afford to begin with. Also try to understand that some of her response could have come from a place of embarrassment, shame, and a general feeling of inadequacy at not being able to afford these things, especially if she is not used to having a smaller budget than everyone around her (it's a hard adjustment).\nBut if I have this wrong and there are no financial issues at all for Lisa, then you are absolutely and completely NTA for being frustrated with her entitlement and wanting compensation ahead of time. \nDespite being as poor as we were, my mom and I were ALWAYS grateful for any help we received, and we NEVER felt entitled to anyone's generosity (if anything, I often felt guilty accepting it). So even if Lisa is having money troubles, she definitely could have handled this in a more polite and gracious manner. And if money is an issue, then you should try to start figuring out cheap or free activities that all the kids can participate in.",
                "If Ollie doesn't want you to ask Lisa for the money upfront, then he needs to pay what she already owes you, agree to pay after the fact for this outing, and then he can worry about getting the money from her. Otherwise he needs to stay out of it. NTA.",
                "There is a big difference between babysitting nibblings when asked, which is when expenses should be agreed in advance and covered. And offering to rake them on a fun day out - that's on you.  I would never offer to take out my nieces and nephews and come back with a pile of receipts for restaurants and gifts. However when asked the parents should offer to cover costs,  out of gratitude. Two very different situations.  Also, it's OK for kids to just hang out, go to the park, eat at home etc.",

                "NTA.\n\nLisa should be paying you for baby sitting besides the actual Nia expenses.",
                "I have a question for you: if Lisa were to pay you upfront, and was more clear and communicative about what budget she can afford, how are you planning to accommodate that? Are you going to adjust the activity for the day such that all 3 children are doing cheaper things together? Or will you continue the plan as before and tell nia \u201cno\u201d to activities her budget doesn\u2019t allow?",
                "ESH except the kids. Lisa sucks for refusing to pay her fair share. Ollie sucks for setting up a Cinderella situation with his son and his stepdaughter. You suck for assuming everyone has an unlimited budget. You, your spouse, your brother, and his ex all suck for spending so extravagantly on a regular basis and creating what will probably be extremely entitled teens/adults. The type of restaurant isn't really the issue. There are lots of less expensive/healthier sit-down restaurants. Spending \u20ac350 (as I saw in one of your comments) for a toy on a random day out is insane. I would be livid if you spent that on my kid even without expecting me to pay you back. Maybe, MAYBE if you lived abroad and saw us every 3-5 years it would be okay, but NO child needs to be indulged like that regularly. A standard outing in my house includes a $10-$25 treat from the gift shop. If we're with friends/family and they're not going to the gift shop, we don't either. If my child wants something that's $50-$150, we'll take a picture and he MIGHT get it for his birthday or Christmas. If he wants something $200+, forget it. It's not happening because he won't take care of it, and I'd be sending the wrong message if he always got everything he wanted. And it's not because we can't afford it.",

Just take them to the park or somewhere free if you don't want to spend money. It's hurtful to let the others pick out whatever gifts their parents can afford while Nia's mom can't afford anything. I'd never ask a sibling to pay for an outing I took my niblings on.",
                "I have to say to me this would be an odd situation. If i take my nieces/nephews /friends children out and i choose the activities i pay for them and would never ask for the money. It would be different i suppose say if going on holiday but even then if I ask to take them i have generally always paid . I enjoy doing things with them and spoiling them tbh. I have also been in the situation that i have taken my son's friend out and paid and his parents had little money and to him he got to do things he wouldn't usually do. If this is a family rule also I find it odd as my family generally is the same as myself. I would hate to be asked for money for my son by close relatives for spending some money on him,  however if this is your'e family's norms like i have explained mine above them your brother should have made it clear to his girlfriend  that this is how it works.  \n\nSome of the things you say you said to her, to me, are offensive ie the comments on \"you cant afford it now \" and \"you were not happy to subsidise Lisa for what she doesn't feel like paying for after the fact\"...I can see why she  got offended. you took the kids out you chose what to buy and the budget its not her not feeling like paying for it after the fact its you that chose what to buy and the cost. You may really have embarrassed her if she didn't have the money and maybe you should just have compromised took x from them for each kid and covered the extra bit yourself, especially if you choose the activities.\n\nI find the concept alien myself ie asking for money back for days out but its the way you write, it doesn't seem like you like her and maybe that comes across to her as well. \n\nI would have taken the same attitude as her and pulled my child from the trip.",
                "Is this woman for real shes got her kids taken care of for free she should he paying for the day out so this woman cant take her kids out without having to foot the bill for someone else's kids at the cost of doing them a favour is she taking the piss??

The church itself only had minor damage. Still it was all together blown up in 1968 with the university buildings. After that a -at this time- very modern university Campus was built.\n\n[https://research.uni-leipzig.de/agintern/baugeschichteuni/images/kmu02.jpg](https://research.uni-leipzig.de/agintern/baugeschichteuni/images/kmu02.jpg)\n\nAlso known as the \"Karl Marx Universit\u00e4t Leipzig\". Angela Merkel studied here.\n\nAfter the GDR (East Germany) was integrated into the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) there was a huge call for a reconciliation with german prewar history/architecture, which has been a taboo in the GDR.\n\nPart of the GDR-campus (facing the Augustusplatz) was demolished and rebuild. What we see here is the result. A modern university and church inspired by the architectural heritage of the Kaiserreich. In a city where about 85% of the people have no religious association.\n\nThere are many different examples on how GDR architecture was hastly demolished after Reunification and replaced with a homage to the Kaiserreich. The most famous one is perhaps the \"Palast der Republik\" in Berlin.",

Built not long after Leipzig was founded, it makes sense to invest an enormous amount of time and resources building a building for the ages, given how fundamental its purpose is for a new city.\n\nIn the 16th century the church becomes a part of the university, and is used both for religious and academic performances - still fundamentally important, but the start of shifting values.\n\nIn 1968 it was demolished by the communist government as part of the university redevelopment- because to a central authoritarian anti-theist communist government its just another building, and all social value is on education, not religion. Noting of course this was not a government chosen by the people, but as was the style protest was not an option.\n\nAnd now to 2007, in a liberal democracy, it is built to function once more in dual purpose as university auditorium and chapel. As a university building in a modern secular society it doesn't have the entire working capital of a city state behind it this time, but by no means is it cheap either.

There are meadows and hills for all of our special friends so they can run and play together. There is plenty of food, water, and sunshine, and our friends are warm and comfortable.\n\nAll the animals who had been ill and old are restored to health and vigor. Those who were hurt or maimed are made whole and strong again, just as we remember them in our dreams of days and times gone by. The animals are happy and content, except for one small thing; they each miss someone very special to them, who had to be left behind.\n\nThey all run and play together, but the day comes when one suddenly stops and looks into the distance. His bright eyes are intent. His eager body quivers. Suddenly he begins to run from the group, flying over the green grass, his legs carrying him faster and faster.\n\nYou have been spotted, and when you and your special friend finally meet, you cling together in joyous reunion, never to be parted again. The happy kisses rain upon your face; your hands again caress the beloved head, and you look once more into the trusting eyes of your pet, so long gone from your life but never absent from your heart.\n\nThen you cross Rainbow Bridge together.",

The reason why the Indonesian government abandon efforts to settle Aceh with Javanese settlers as they did with West Papua was because the insurgents would attack Javanese settlers, something that only recently happened in West Papua.\n\n The Acehnese doesn't get much sympathy from the West, because they are Muslims.
