You don't have to be specifically educated. \n\nWhat does happen if you become mayor or minister or president is that you assemble a team that you trust to help you with your responsibility. In case of DepEd, that would be ... teachers and professors. They would make the reform, explain it to her and what the goals are, the changes and usually why they are better for: the students, teachers and the budget. Or a combination.

May mga binoboto kasi na mga  barangay chairs at kagawad na hindi alam gawin nila. Sana matuto tayo lahat sa school. \n\nSa senior high school, pakituro labor law at basic civil and criminal law. Dami na pwede magtrabaho at dami na pwede gawing contracts tulad ng sale, lease, and loan. Sa criminal law, sana ituro na bawal ang estafa at libel at iba pang offenses. \n\nKahit iyon lang muna kasi lawyer si VP Sara so gets naman sana niya ito.

She thought they were wonderful and Godly and somehow more accurate because they were older? They showed George Washington praying and the founding fathers were shown as good Christians, not deists or people who practiced their faith behind closed doors. They're really weird. \n\nFlipping through a McGuffey reader or an old history book as an exercise in analyzing primary sources is fine.

                "Article text:\n\nLast year, pension costs increased by \u00a36 billion to \u00a3110 billion. By 2025 they are expected to have ballooned to \u00a3135 billion, a figure \u00a32 billion more than the combined day-to-day budgets for the Department for Education, the Home Office and the Ministry of Defence, Times analysis shows.\n\nBut experts said that the triple lock was becoming \u201cunsustainable\u201d at a time of huge planned budget cuts across Whitehall over the next five years.\n\nA third of people do not believe the state pension will exist in 30 years\u2019 time, with those who voted Leave in the EU referendum and 2019 Tory voters feeling most pessimistic, according to polling by the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank (IFS) and Abrdn Financial Fairness Trust.\n\nThe rise in pension spending is in part due to the ageing population, with the full impact of the late 1950s/early 1960s baby boom not yet having taken effect. Between April 2026 and 2028 the state pension age will rise to 67, and the plan is to raise it further to 68 between 2044 and 2046. However, a review is due.\n\nA second government source said there was little that could be done to ease the cost in the short-term and that future decisions would be a \u201cproblem for the next government\u201d. In the year to August 2022, the number of people receiving a state pension rose by 130,000 to 12.6 million.\n\nSir Steve Webb, the former Liberal Democrat pensions minister, said that as well as pension spending increasing, NHS and social care spending would rise to deal with the higher health costs of looking after more elderly people. He suggested ministers would eventually be forced to raise taxes.\n\nHe said: \u201cPensioners are a protected group electorally, so the state pension gets protected. The NHS is a kind of national religion and is protected. And therefore everything else gets squeezed.\u201d\n\nWebb said defence, schools and working-age benefits had already suffered but added: \u201cThe time will come when none of those things can be squeezed anymore, and that\u2019s when the crunch really comes.\u201d\n\nThe triple lock led to the state pension increasing by 10.1 per cent this year. Both main parties have committed themselves to keeping the triple lock until 2030.\n\nBoth Lord Hague of Richmond, the former Tory leader and Times columnist, and the IFS have said the triple lock is \u201cunsustainable\u201d.\n\nThe Tory peer Baroness Altmann, a former pensions minister, said: \u201cI don\u2019t think the triple lock is a sensible policy.\u201d\n\nShe proposed a \u201cdouble lock\u201d based on inflation and earnings but said money could also be saved by raising the number of years of national insurance contributions needed to qualify for a state pension.\n\nCurrently that is set at 35, but Altmann said this could be increased to 45 with those without a full record being eligible for a proportionate amount based on their contribution. \u201cIt would save money but still retain the principles that are so important to the system,\u201d she said.\n\nThe IFS/Financial Fairness Trust research found that 15 per cent of people did not expect to retire until their seventies, and 13 per cent did not expect to retire at all. The survey also showed that 47 per cent expected to be less comfortable than their parents. Those aged between 50-64 were among those who believed they would be less well off than their parents, despite their parents on average having accumulated much less wealth than them.\n\nThe IFS has said that if the state pension age rises as planned, the share of those over state pension age would rise from 24 per cent today to 27 per cent in 2050 and then to 30 per cent in 2070.\n\nBut Altmann said governments would simply have to accept that the state pension bill would continue to rise. She said: \u201cUnless you\u2019re recommending euthanasia or mass poverty for elderly pensioners, how else would you do it?\u201d",

Employers don't care, they just care about past experience now. I completely agree with what's been said here. \n\n-----------\n\nYour A-level grades are only important until you do something else, be that work in an industry for a little while, or get a degree.

I don\u2019t know how many times you are asked about your results but I am never asked about my results, even my university results, to be honest, I am never asked about them.\u201d  \nMs Keegan said both A-levels and GCSEs are \u201cinternationally renowned qualifications\u201d and \u201cthey need to hold their value\u201d.  \nThe Tory frontbencher said it had been a \u201ccouple of years now since the pandemic and it is fair\u201d to return to the pre-pandemic approach.  \n\u2018Leadership is important\u2019  \n\u201cThere is a time when you have got to make these decisions, leadership is important, the value of qualifications is really important and we thought this was the right time to do it,\u201d she said.  \nMs Keegan said the Government had been \u201cworking with employers to make sure that they are fully aware that these are equal to the 2019 cohort\u201d.  \nLast year, more than a third - 36.4 per cent - of UK A-level entries were awarded A or A\\* grades, compared to 44.8 per cent in 2021 and 38.5 per cent in 2020.  \nIn 2019, the last summer before the pandemic, around one in four - 25.4 per cent - of UK A-level entries were awarded A or A\\* grades.  \nIn Wales and Northern Ireland, exam regulators have said they do not expect to return to pre-pandemic grading standards until 2024.  \nThe cohort of students receiving their A-level results on Thursday did not sit GCSE exams and were awarded teacher-assessed grades amid the pandemic.\n\n**Read more: https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2023/08/17/a-level-grades-pre-pandemic-grades-gillian-keegan/**",

                "Thanks for sharing this. I had not heard of Christine Emba before, but she touches on a lot of things I\u2019m observing in real-time with my young male relatives. These kids are not alt-right; in fact, most of them came from very liberal homes where mom was the primary breadwinner. They love and respect their moms and dads, but the advice they get from those people - and especially from older generations like grandparents - is that men need to be a certain way. But that \u201ccertain way\u201d conflicts with a lot of the messaging from society and it creates a gap, a void, that guys like Andrew Tate are happy to fill. It\u2019s questions about identity like we all had at a young age, but with no clear answers from one side, and *very* clear and simple answers from the other.",
                "Reading this article made me think of a lesson I learned when I was in college:\n\nIt\u2019s just as important to know what you\u2019re doing right as it is to know what you\u2019re doing wrong.",
                "One thing I don't see people talk about is the grouping of people by age. We start it in schools so you have a bunch of kids who spend all day with each other and they aren't getting the opportunities to learn from the kids who came before them. So these kids spend most of the youth in school with other people who are just as lost. If kids spent time with a variety of adults they might get a sense of how to act from the people who've already been through it. Does that make sense to anyone?",
                "There needs to be a better counter to the right wing monopoly of resources for men.\n\nImo, a big issue with the left is gatekeeping and purity-testing.\n\nRight-wing personalities have a carte blanch to say almost anything they want without fear of reprisals from other right-wingers.\n\nLindsey Ellis, a leftist YouTube personality who has made some incredible and well thought-out videos was cancelled for comparing Raya and the Last Dragon to Avatar: The Last Airbender\u2026\n\nAt risk of sounding like a boomer, the left just needs to stop finding things to be offended by and work on creating a supportive environment liberal/leftist voices.",
                "This article starts out by saying that we see all the success that has been achieved for women but doesn't actually ever stop to consider how our community did that. The author only considers what we should do within the current broken framework.\n\nIt's feels kinda silly to me. It's like we want so hard to mirror the success of women but we want to do it under the framework of traditional masculinity that caused these problems. \n\nWhen we talk to our young girls, we do not tell them to be Michelle Obama or their not feminine or not a good women. So why would we want to tell boy to be like [insert male role model] or their not masculine or not a good man? That's setting boys up for failure. *Even if that's what young boys/men are asking for, I don't want to set people up to measure themselves against extreme measures of success.*\n\nWe tell our little girls that they can be *whatever* they want. A thousand times we tell them that. I've got 2 little girls that I'm raising and if one of them asks \"how to be a good woman?\" I swear to god I'm not going to start listing out feminine women for them to emulate. I'm going to tell them it's something that they get to define themselves. I'll tell them for myself, I think it's being compassionate, being secure in yourself, helping those around you and living a fulfilling life. \n\nWhy should we do any less for boys? It feels cheap and lazy to simply pick out men we see on twitter to act as a measuring stick, which many men will never measure up against. \"Be like Aragon\", we told that 15yo boy who has no way of achieving that. \"You should be like Dwayne Johnson\", was told to the boy with mobility issues. Is Cpt Jean-Luc Picard any more attainable? What about Newt Scaramander? \n\nUnless you have limitless resources and talent. Unless you are without mobility issues, or without systemic race or gender issues, or you come from a place without resources, how the fuck are any of these role models achievable? \n\nThe patriarchy placed upon us guides to our masculinity to force a hierarchy. I reject that we should place similar guides on our masculinity on ourselves. \n\nTo the young boy or young man that is asking for someone to tell him what to do, I say this: Life is fucking hard. It is our struggle to find out what fulfills and sustains us. It is not as easy as it was for our grandfathers to know what to do or how to be a man, but this a good change. So many men fall into the trap of thinking they have to act traditionally masculine to be a man. And so many men realize only later in life what it cost them. Even though it will be hard, I believe it is easier to figure out who you are now, while you are 15 than it will be when you are 55. So grow out your hair. Learn to tap dance. Bake cakes. Wear women's jeans with no pockets. Do all of the things that our community will tell you not to, because it is not fair to you to let society to dictate what you can do. You deserve to be whatever you want to be. \n\nMy grandfather never fathered my dad for fear of being less-than. My father never fathered me either. Neither of them will know the joy I get from parenting my children. My father today is trapped in relationships that do not value his presence. I do not love the man that once strangled me, thinking he had to be in control to be a man. He's been that way for so long, he's just stuck living out the rest of his days not wanting to be the person he thought he had to be.",
                "Part of the problem is that we continually define \u201cmasculinity\u201d and \u201cmanliness\u201d in opposition to \u201cfemininity\u201d and \u201cwomanhood.\u201d \n\nThat\u2019s wrong. \n\nThe opposite of \u201cman\u201d is \u201cchild,\u201d not \u201cwoman.\u201d The same traits that describe a \u201creal man\u201d can be used to describe a \u201creal woman\u201d as well.  For example, in a traditional household, dad earns the money, but mom gets the groceries and cooks the food. Both parents are providing and are essential in providing. \n\nSo traits such as self-reliance, moderation, etc that we define as manly are what separate us from children, not from women. \n\nI\u2019m teaching my son that a man protects without smothering. But the way you protect varies based on the situation. Maybe I confront an aggressor, or maybe I steer you away from a risky situation.",
                "I have more than a few thoughts on this subject as a male myself and observing general trends.  I don\u2019t agree with everything streamer Destiny says, but I do agree with him on this point: \u201cwhile society has focused on empowering women, it has forgotten about or neglected men.\u201d  So what is happening here? Firstly, the increasing atomization of society in line with late stage capitalism and being chronically online has made it harder than ever to make friends and to an extent, quality romantic relationships. Americans (especially men) are working more than ever with less to show for it. The increasing cost of living relative to wage increases means that many men are running a rat race that they feel they can\u2019t keep up with. Exhausted from work, it is only natural to feel no inclination to socialize and to numb oneself by overeating junk food, scrolling social media, and compulsively watch porn. It has never been easier to tune out your degrading mental health with any number of distractions, but each one rolls downhill like a snowball, cumulating into worse and worse habits. Overtime, the lack of social skills that may be the result of anxiety or from lack of a supportive environment in which supportive and nurturing communication and relationships was the norm makes it easier to just stop trying. Why run a race after all if you are already losing?\n\nSecond, you hear mixed messages everyday on what it means to be a man. Society encourages you to reject toxic masculinity. They will tell you it doesn\u2019t matter how much money you make, you can cry whenever you want, no one will care. The ideology is much more different than the actual practice. The truth is at least in America is that  men are still judged by their ability to provide.  Men are still judged for showing their emotions in certain contexts. Cry during your dad\u2019s funeral? Fine. Okay. Cry because you are lonely and can\u2019t find a girlfriend? Stop being an Incel loser. Maybe if you weren\u2019t so toxically masculine, you would find someone, etc..  The truth is I have seen this type of messaging on Reddit and other places far too often. As a result of these mixed messages,  young men are naturally confused. They look for certainty. The left will tell them to reject masculine stereotypes and just be yourself while the right will go full bore the other side of the spectrum and encourage you to be ultra stoic, dominant, and aggressive. Neither are good approaches for obvious reasons. The first lacks the structure which is needed for a sense of certainty and the latter lacks the emotional intelligence and empathy, which many women in modern relationships want. The appeal of the conservative option and why I believe more men are leaning conservative is because it tells you the \u201chow\u201d of being a man. This provides some certainty, even if it has its own flaws.\n\nThe truth of the matter is this: how a man thinks about his own masculinity is a central aspect of his identity and for many a sense of worth and purpose. What is truly happening is not a crisis of masculinity, but an identity crisis. A crisis which will take a shift in attitudes and understanding of what if means to be a man. A crisis which I hope is addressed sooner rather than later.",
                "Well, to start with, when men have a problem it is phrased as \"what's that matter with men?\" as opposed to \"what problems are men facing\".",
                "It's kind of frustrating hearing and literally seeing the issue of confused men materially affecting themselves and other for the worse and hearing either A: bad non solutions or B: denial that the problem even exists",

                ">I think it\u2019s just factually accurate that conservatives and the right have always been more invested in \u2014 and more clear about \u2014 gender roles. So it\u2019s almost natural that they have a clearer vision of what manhood is and what men should do. But I think they realize that there was an opening here. Young men especially are looking for role models and realizing that they feel unsure and uncomfortable of their place in the world.\n\n>There\u2019s a young man who I interviewed for the piece, who was like, *I just want someone to tell me how to be.* If the progressive left is like, *We\u2019re not going to tell you that, just be a good person, you don\u2019t need rules*. And then young men are like, *No, I\u2019m really asking you. I really want rules, actually,* the right is happy to give them those rules.\n\nCan anyone else see the very obvious, big, flashing-red problem here? \n\nIf \"the progressive left\" is not out here assigning gender roles to young men, and \"the right\" is, that means these dudes are going to end up with a set of gender roles and norms that deeply suck ass, especially for women. There's a very clear reason women reject traditional norms: because conservatives want women to be servile to men. Fair enough! But if \"the right\" (I'm just using their terminology here, I know it sucks) is encouraging boys and young men to assert their God-given right to power and control, yeah, that's going to be an attractive message for an aimless teen boy.",
                "I can't speak for other men much less all.men, but I was raised with the message that \"men didn't cry\" \"men were strong\" \"men took charge\" \"men didnt like sissy shit like hugging and talking about feels\"\n\nGuys like Tate are this mentality dialled up to a billion and it's so fucking disgusting to me. But he's not alone in this expectations. Most of the women I dealt with (aside from my mum and a one or two others), certainly anyone I tried to ask out, all basi ally said the same thing.\n\nI'm not manly enough.\n\nOver the years I've become numbed to my own feelings and have taken to losing myself in distractions games, movies, porn, whatever it takes to not have to deal with the disconnect between everyone's expectations and me.\n\nI'm almost 50 now and am just spinning my wheels until I pass on.

                "\n>What\u2019s going on with men? It\u2019s a strange question\n\nWhy is that a strange question? Because:\n\n>Whether you look at education or the labor market or addiction rates or suicide attempts, it\u2019s not a pretty picture for men\n\nSo again I ask why it's strange to notice all these negative outcomes for almost half of the people living on the planet and not wonder what's going on?",
                "I genuinely believe that the answer is to grow and expand spaces of discussion like this one here. I understand that is a tall order in and of itself, but I think that the most valuable thing this community offers is that it has fostered a very healthy environment for discussion about very heated topics. \n\nTempers run hot around almost anything that we talk about here, but I think that we generally all try to approach conversation with people here by assuming that even if they disagree with us that they are arguing in good faith at least. This is in pretty stark contrast to the way that, as a lot of people have pointed out already, many leftist spaces operate wherein people often feel (and are) attacked for their differences in opinion.\n\nI think the main reason for this is that we don't rely on the moderators alone to enforce certain expectations, such as that we all at least attempt to offer something productive to the discussion at hand. When we see someone behaving questioningly, we generally try to get them to explain and perhaps question their behavior instead of simply chasing them away. I think this is an attitude that is difficult to foster outside of an environment where moderators can help to enforce it where necessary, but that at least trying to do so is integral to countering the seemingly easy answers that people like Tate spout.",
                "Things aren't as simple as right and left, conservative or liberal. There are countless levels of identities, priveleges, and oppression. The US is a complicated and convoluted place without a unified march. We place too much emphasis on what we read or see on our phones and devices and less time talking things out with the people right in front of us. We bitch and complain yet don't go out and vote.",
                "I think there is an assumption underlying a lot of discussion around masculine identity and male mental health.\n\nIt keeps being discussed in a pretty individualistic way. Like a good healthy identity is something that a person can have that exists in a vacuum. And then the discussion turns to how society and culture and structural inertia can provide those individual identity's. \n\nLike discussion of the manosphere offering young men a gender role Like it's a product. \n\nBut I don't think that's the most useful lens to look at masculine identity and male gender roles is in this context. I think it helps to view it as an agreement between society and the individual. A contract almost. Society says, if you behavior and belive X, Y and Z, then collectively we will offer you A, B and C. \n\nSome other people have identified in their personal relationships the distance between peoples stated values for men, and what they actually reward in practice. I think that's the broader issue expressed in microcosm. Progressive spaces do have roles for men in practice implicitly, as a structural reality they have to. But they are unspoken, inconsistent and contradictory. I think part of the reason it's hard for these progressive spaces to identify and define the roles they are actually places on men in practice, is because stating them out loud would show how cruel they are. There is an expectation that men at the  bottom of the patriarchy still get as exploited by patriarchy as much as ever, while still mostly being rewarded implicitly for the traits that are vilified explicitly. It's hecking confusing guys.\n\nThe right isn't doing any better. They offer very clearly defined ideas that don't work, because society isn't actually willing to hold up its end of those agreements. (Apart from the awful shape a society that could meet those ideals would need to be as well).\n\nI don't buy into the historical essentialism or biological essentialism. Sure, historically masculinity has meant provider, protector. And sure, we all got lots of that tasty tasty testosterone. \n\nBut ultimately, if we can all agree on some expectations that result in community inclusion, and the safety and prosperity of us and the people around us, we'll adapt. It doesn't need to be role models specifically. It doesn't need to be any specific way of communicating that consensus. The lack of role models is a symptom of there being no explicit consensus to communicate.",
                "> What\u2019s going on with men?\n\nWe are overworking ourselves to death and have little to nothing in our pockets. That's what's going on.

                "I have no interest in being a provider, protector or procreator. To me, masculinity is just an aesthetic.

                "I can't overstate how much I dislike the fact that the author kept painting Jordan Peterson and Josh Hawley as the reasonable moderates.

                "I think a major point of reckoning for leftist politics coming up is going to be the consequences of analyzing gender the way you would race or class.\n\nRace is a made up concept invented by people in the 15-1600s in order to construct a secular justification for the inhumanities committed by colonialism in light of the renaissance ideas of liberty, humanism, and reason. If someone identifies as \"white\", they are doing so voluntarily. Criticizing someone for participating in this structure is valid.\n\nClass isn't fully a construct, but it is within someones control to participate in. If someone is a billionaire, and they give aware their money, they are no longer a billionaire. Criticizing someone for participating in this structure is valid.\n\nGender is actually not really a construct, and the recent rise of transgender rights i think has proven this. When you criticize a guy for participating in the \"patriarchy\", and demeaning and insulting them for being who they are, then defending it by saying you are \"punching up\", you quite literally are demeaning someone for being something they can't control. This isn't a valid thing to criticize participation in. \n\nPeople can choose to be a part of systemic racial structures, they can choose to be rich, they can't choose to be a guy. Criticizing someone for participating in this structure is not valid.\n\nUntil the left reconciles this there isnt going to be progress being made, because even as someone who is hard to the left and is in no danger of going to the manosphere spaces, it's really hard to be a space that supposedly is your ally and have to constantly hear about how much you suck, and are bad for being who you are over and over again and then just have to suck it up and take it due to theoretical power structures you have no control over being a part of.",

                "Personally; I (age 8)asked dad, \" What do you do for work?\" He went off into a rant about capitalism and business ownership. It was to the effect of \"The lazy N*****'s need to be forced to work. No wants wants to work anymore....All anyone does is complain about how they're not being paid enough. \"\n\n His explanation clearly demonstrated his unethical, racist perspective. It was vile. I was horrified. I made up my mind then and there to never treat anyone like that. I would conduct business in an ethical manner.  Since then, 40 years have passed, and I haven't seen a single business that I would consider to be entirely ethical.\nALL PROFIT IS STOLEN WAGES.\n\nMy distaste for capitalism even extends to investing. If you're investing with an eye towards ROI. Wherever that money is invested...that business concern has to pay their employees less to bring about a profit to give you a return. \n\nCapitalism is like the ring of Sauron. It can not be wielded to destroy itself or the inequity we all face.\n\nIn brief, if the only way I have to better my circumstances is to screw someone else over, I would rather remain poor.\n\nMost of these men are probably thinking along these lines but haven't voiced it out loud.\n\nEven if you go to college and get a better paying job (no guarantee it will happen), you essentially end up slaving away to pay for the student loan. Same reasoning as aforementioned investing.\n\nSo these men, having figured out the game is seriously rigged, are prefering,  not to play at all.\n\nFor women who only recently have been allowed to even play, there is a determination to beat the game. They're well aware it is rigged as well, but are of the mindset, I will beat you at it anyway. This is admirable and worth applauding. It will not, however, change anything. The game remains and will always remain rigged.",
                "I have heard many times from right leaning people at work and other places that the worst thing you can be in America is a white male. That really appeals to white males because all you heard about is some sort of special treatment for every other else. It\u2019s created this perception that somehow they have some mystical privilege that will automatically pay for their college, help them with a down payment for their first home, give them a good job, etc. At some point, we are going to have to abandon the idea of special classes and treat everyone based upon merit and social standing only. If you are poor and deserving, you should be treated the same as everyone else. There are consequences to not treating people fairly. I think we are seeing that with the ease of radicalization of white males to the far right. I honestly believe the issue is at the heart of what is putting our democracy at risk.\n\nI know the issue of men extends beyond race, but in my eyes it has a lot to do with equality. Men are told they don\u2019t need help because they have longer bootstraps. It\u2019s simply not the case.",
                "Much of the conversation about men wanting a masculinity archetype to emulate is (to me) a request for rules to follow in order to gain social status. So much of the traditional masculinity approach was about being manly in order to be treated as superior to anyone less manly. Fitting the terms of manliness was and often still is treated as a symbol of worthiness for admiration and reward. \n\nThat is what it sounds these men still want and that very concept is gross in my opinion. The right wing ones want the old rules for that status so they can be superior to less manly men and all women. The less right wing ones want new rules so they can be superior to men who don't fit the rules and women who don't fit their gender rules. Gender roles/rules/coding are about creating in and out groups, who is masculine and who is not. There is no other way for them to work and no other desire to justify them. Those that want them may believe they want rules to feel better about themselves but in reality it's just because they measure their worth by who they are perceived to have more status than. \n\nNewer, softer rules for masculinity is a cute wrapper around the desire to dominate and nothing more. If it were not, advice on how to be a good person, happy, fulfilled, or feel self worth would be enough but it is not. It must be gender expectations that can be met so that status can be conferred upon those who meet them and those who want this will accept nothing else. For this same reason, everyone who makes up new rules for masculinity just describes their own strengths.\n\nEdit: Typo",
                "Ok, I'm so tired of this \"the left don't speak to young men\" narrative. just because some d-bag reactionary is popular. It's tiring and it's now becoming a story which people take as fact without proper investigation. And the issue is that if this story becomes fact, then we REALLY will not be able to reach young men. \n\nThe left, non reactionary, feminist counter to traditionalism speaking DIRECTLY to men and young boys is happening and has happened for decades. Jackson Katz in his article in Ms said the same thing: \"In fact, a multiracial, multiethnic movement of pro-feminist men has been organizing, agitating and trying to break through into mainstream discourse and consciousness since the 1970s.\n\nBut judging by the near absence of any acknowledgment it has received in recent media coverage of a \u201ccrisis in masculinity,\u201d it appears that few people know this movement even exists. \" https://msmagazine.com/2023/08/01/ken-barbie-men-boys-feminism-masculinity/\n\nFor more information about that history of feminist allies and men doing this work in the decades, check out the book Some Men by Michael Messner https://www.amazon.ca/Some-Men-Feminist-Movement-Violence/dp/0199338779\n\nLet's review some of the people talking directly to boys: \n- Next Gen Men: https://www.nextgenmen.ca/youth (Canada)\n- A Call to Men: https://www.acalltomen.org/ (US)\n- The ManCave: https://themancave.life/ (Australia)\n- Jackson Katz MVP model which has been used countless of times in many settings with boys and young men: http://cultureofrespect.org/program/mentors-in-violence-prevention-mvp/\n- Moosehide Campaign - https://moosehidecampaign.ca/ (An indigenous led org talking to men and young boys)\n\nAnd this is just a small list, and doesn't count the numerous number of people doing grassroot work such as the YMCA, and various Sexual Assault Centers. This list also doesn't count the many people gathering their friends to do book clubs, gatherings and hangouts all talking about gender and masculinity and how to be a good person in the world today. \n\nSo next time someone tells you this myth because another reactionary became popular, please counter this with people who are doing this work and RAISE THEM UP.",

The expectation is that Jack will get into a better college than Peter.\n\nAs a reward for being an excellent student all these years, my wife and I have decided to prioritize Jack's education over Peter's.\n\nWe have two separate accounts with equal amounts of money that we've saved over time for each of them to help with college expenses. They still have access to this money.\n\nHowever, we've decided that when we contribute additional funds, our priority will be to pay for the best possible college for Jack, while whatever remains in our budget will go towards Peter's education.\n\nWhen we discussed this with them, Peter was furious. He argued that we've seen how hard he's worked all these years, that he has as much money as Jack, and that it's unfair to penalize him just because Jack is naturally smarter.\n\nINFO: Both want to go to Law School in future.\n\nINFO2: Peter has enough money in the saving account to probably cover most of the colleges in the country. The issue is that if both of them go to extremely expensive schools, then the extra amount I can contribute won't be divided equally.  \n\n\nINFO3: We have a policy of no loans and we don't want them to work during college. That's why both of them have a substantial amount of money saved up. If Peter wants to work or take out loans, that will be his responsibility.",

You're an ass for all of it: comparing your children like that, prioritizing one over the other, telling them all of this, and giving Peter serious doubts about his parents' love.\n\nI'm a teacher. Grades and test scores are NOT a reflection of how much a student knows, only a reflection of how well they complete assessments. And while that is important in school, it's not important in life. Assuming that Peter is not failing his classes now, he can get through college just fine and become very successful. Once you're out of college, nobody cares about your grades and test scores, only that you got a degree. \n\nAnd before you even go there, no, I am not overcompensating for my own inadequacies with poor grades and test scores.

And you want to let him have the financial scraps.\n\nIf you do this, then you\u2019ll wonder in a few years why your biological son never contacts you. Why he moved far away, why he ignores your calls. Eventually, you\u2019ll wonder why you weren\u2019t informed about his wedding. One day, you might find out you have a grandchild through a relative. Don\u2019t get your hopes up though, he\u2019ll make sure you\u2019ll never be \u201cgrandpa/grandma\u201d to his children. \n\nBut hey, you have your smart stepson to make up for it, so why care about your not as smart child?",

You don\u2019t need to tell them why but Its a more fair way of going about it without making one brother feel less than the other. \n\nPeter is going have some issues to work out with a professional after not only comparing himself to his step brother but now finding out his parents see him as less worthy of support because of it.",

                "YTA\n\nTeacher here who has taught at some top college prep schools around the world where many of my students went to world ivies (not just US).\n\nYou do realize that universities rely on much more than grades/scores/ECs for accepting prospectives, right? That for every open spot those top tier schools have, they get hundreds of applications with those same kinds of achievements? I have seen students from my schools with those same high qualifications be rejected while other students with high (but not top) grades but stellar recommendations and especially personal essays were accepted. \n\nAnd right now, it sounds like neither child has actually been accepted to any university.\n\nSo while I understand you want to decide financial information before the applications/acceptances, you really are putting your cart before your horse right now.\n\nHowever, I still don\u2019t understand your game plan here with your son/stepson. How did you expect your son to feel or react when you told him that his education is second to his step brother\u2019s?\n\nYou have two children who have been working *hard* to get scores/grades/ECs/recognitions- you said in several comments that your son was competing even if he didn\u2019t win against Jack, that Peter *was* trying. This sounds like it has been going on for years. \n\nSo for years Peter has been working and trying hard but never quite has been able to match Jack academically. And now, you sit him down and tell him that he not only is not as good as Jack academically but that financially he is not going to get the same kind of help as Jack- **that in the eyes of his own dad, your son has once and for all come in second.**\n\nThere is a reason the adage \u201cactions speak louder than words\u201d exists. You might want to reflect on what message your actions are yelling at your son, even if your words are whispering something different.",

If one wants to spend more money then his share, then get a job and/or loan.\n\nIt could only be acceptable if Jack went to uni and Peter refused. But even so, you should help Peter get his start to life, just the same. \n\nNow you're only showing who you care for more.

Who thinks \"while whatever remains in our budget will go towards Peter's education\" is ever a nice thing to do or say.  It will be seen by your son, that your wife has influenced this, and could destroy that relationship.  It could destroy relationships between family members, extended family.\n\nAll I can say is this, way to \"Nuke\" a family you have built.  Lets say your son needed a dentist to remove a tooth, so you use a tow truck to pull it?!\n\nWhat drugs, or alternate world did you come from that you thought this would end well?\n\nYou have just created a situation, that your son will remember forever.  He maybe the one who puts you in a care facility later in life, and when he chooses the worst he can, think back on this moment!\n\nEdit\n\nWhat would you do if Jack gets into a college means that Peter cant go to college because it costs too much?  What would you say?  Sorry Peter you didn't try hard enough?  Sorry Peter you didn't do enough to earn it?  Sorry we are scraping the bottom of the barrel for you?

Yes, that would suck for child number one, but not every resource a family has needs to be split down the middle equally for all children. Some children have needs that other children don\u2019t have.\n\nMaking a spreadsheet that contains every swimming lesson, every music lesson, every extracurricular activity, every set of braces, every set of eyeglasses, every medical expense, every therapy session, every summer camp, and somehow making sure that every child has equal resources through their entire life is ludicrous.\n\nYou give the appropriate resources to the appropriate child in the appropriate manner that matches their skill set, and interest so they can all thrive.

We've always treated them equally: they went to the same school, each had their own room, and each one practiced the sports that like...  \n\n\n  \nDespite treating them equally, each had their own personality, interests, and hobbies, and we've always respected these individualities. Overall, they've both been great kids and never caused any trouble.  \n\n\n  \nOver the years, both have been dedicated students, but Jack has always been a better student than Peter, holding leadership positions in extracurriculars and performing slightly better on both the SAT and ACT.  \n\n\n  \nLately, they have been filling out college applications. The expectation is that Jack will get into a better college than Peter.  \n\n\n  \nAs a reward for being an excellent student all these years, my wife and I have decided to prioritize Jack's education over Peter's.  \n\n\n  \nWe have two separate accounts with equal amounts of money that we've saved over time for each of them to help with college expenses. They still have access to this money.  \n\n\n  \nHowever, we've decided that when we contribute additional funds, our priority will be to pay for the best possible college for Jack, while whatever remains in our budget will go towards Peter's education.  \n\n\n  \nWhen we discussed this with them, Peter was furious. He argued that we've seen how hard he's worked all these years, that he has as much money as Jack, and that it's unfair to penalize him just because Jack is naturally smarter.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Crossguards are tools meant to protect your hands from a blade that slides down, something not really possible with a lightsaber due to how much friction the two blades produce when pressing against each other. This is why the one time we actually see two lightsaber blades rub against each other, it creates a horrible hissing noise indicating how much friction is being exerted against both blades.",

We can hope to raise our children to be smart with money and make great financial decisions but the truth is that sometimes they don\u2019t turn out that way. And when your kid turns old enough to get that money, it\u2019s theirs. And you may be giving them $20,000 to fuel a dangerous addiction or habit. \n\nMy husband and I are very fortunate that his parents paid for his college and he was given access to a mutual fund at the age of 24. We used it for a down payment on our first home and it turned out to be an amazing investment of that money. My brother in law however, did not make great choices with the money and it was obvious at the time that he was not mentally well enough to get it but since there were not any legal reasons to withhold the account, they had to turn it over to him. So just keep that in mind when saving for your children! \n\nSo, we are doing 529s as well as a high yield savings account in our own names with \u201cbuckets\u201d of money earmarked for our kids for when they are older. This way the money is technically still ours but we do have every intention of gifting it to our children eventually. Be that in form of a down payment of a car or home or a big wedding will be up to them. We also plan to open credit cards in their names once they are 10 or so in order to build them good credit (we will use these cards to purchase school/sporting supplies and pay them off on time right away)",
                "$600/month into a 529 for 1 kid. Hoping to do the same for #2 that\u2019s coming soon. Our aim isn\u2019t to pay for everything, but to help out (but dear god, please let the bubble burst). Hopefully they will go in state, get scholarships, community for a few years, or do a trade school.\n\nEdit: I think the best way to help your future adult child is to make sure your retirement is set before saving for college for them.",

                "To be honest my child\u2019s private pre school for one school year cost more than 1 school year of my masters program. But I suppose it all depends where your kid goes to college.",
                "We put 2 kids thru college, neither have school loans. (Third kid isn't cut out for college)\n\nWe got lucky, husband received $10k when his grandmother passed away. Our oldest was about 3 at the time, while we certainly could have used it (money was really tight), I invested it in a mutual fund. Stock market did well and 20 years later it was worth $115k (we didn't add any more $, that was $105k increase).\n\nOne big tip... colleges set aside $ for scholarships, and that $ is on a first come, first served basis. In other words, apply \"early\" (usually by November senior year); by January when the usual applications are done, those scholarship funds are already offered/gone.\n\nGo on college tours before junior year (typically when to-be seniors are doing it) to narrow down choices. Don't go by what looks good on paper, let the student choose by their gut... what feels right to them is usually the school they'll be happier at and do well.\n\nTour the top choices again the following year, hopefully it's 4 or less. Basically let your top 2 or 3 schools know you are interested in them and you are more likely to get that scholarship money. Don't be afraid to \"woo\" them, you can also let your top school know that 2nd choice offered more scholarship money and ask if they could meet that.\n\n(Above I learned from a Thrivent seminar, and it was great advice.)\n\nTip 2. Take college level classes and AP tests in high school. My oldest entered college basically as a sophomore.\n\nTip 3. Always apply to a \"fallback\" school close to home. In my local parent group there was a student whose school got closed from a hurricane, many got homesick, a parent was diagnosed with cancer and the student didn't want to be far away, etc.\n\nFinally, if you are saving for your kids college, your doing good. Make sure to fund your Roth IRA's to the fullest each year, you will be more ahead that way; your kids can always take out school loans, but you can't take out retirement loans.",

That's what he's interested in. \n\nIf he decides that's not what he wants to do, we're out nothing and he has other options available.\n\nWe have had him keep his grades up and volunteer and he will also get an a+ scholarship that will cover 2 yrs at a community college in state. \n\n He is also native American and we are registered with our tribe. The tribe provides tons of opportunities for our children when it comes to higher education. For both certificate classes, technical school, and traditional degrees. \n\nKeep an eye on scholarships. There are a lot of opportunities as they grow to enter contests that give them bonds for use for college. Fill out for as many scholarships and grants as possible. There are some crazy ones he will qualify for simply because others don't know they exist. That's how I got 3 of them in highschool.

Grandma and grandpa handle that with his input. 2 nephews kept breeding them and are still going. 2 kids have sold theirs off and have no more. They made those decisions in highschool. My son is electing to keep building his here for now. Selling the off is his decision. He does all that with them. \n\n\nAs of now, my son has zero interest in a degree. He's dead set on doing the IT. He will live at home probably until he's married. That's what my husband's family has done and it sets them up for life in a very great way. \n\nMy family was the opposite  move out immediately and start life.  I took my two younger siblings to finish their highschool and done all the things for them as I could. Including living at my home until they were ready to get out.

Starting deposit of $1k, $250/monthly. All invested in a S&P500 index fund like SPY/VOO with 12% returns over past 10 years. With that kind of return that 529 should have $198k in there in 18 years, which should be enough to cover a 4 year OOS college if kiddo wants. Obviously past performance is not indicative of future results but us putting up $3k a year is fine.",

We opened up savings accounts for our kids basically the month they were born, and put all of that stipend in. We put an additional 10,000 JPY (like $70?) a month in each of their accounts. We also put any birthday or celebration money we get from relatives in there.\n\nBless my wife, she\u2019s way better at managing and moving around money than I am. I would\u2019ve never thought to separate out the money like this. Thanks to her, my oldest child at 3 years old has the equivalent of around $7,000 saved up in her name! Currently in the process of convincing my Japanese wife (extremely risk averse) to put these funds in a safe investment account so it\u2019s not making the meager .001% interest that it\u2019s currently making.\n\nIf my kids decide to go to college in Japan, National universities are capped at around $3500 a year, so that\u2019s a great option.

That money is considered by financial aid office as available for tuition.  So when my mom died when my son was a senior in college, my inheritance did not go towards my retirement like I planned.

We were very short on saving for our son (who is going off to college tomorrow), so we only have about $17k saved. We are going to contribute as much as possible, but he'll still need a loan. The rule of thumb is, don't take out more than your expected earnings for your first year out of school. Getting Gen Ed credits or of the way from a community college can reduce the costs of going to a first choice school too.",

He is continuing to work while going to school, but only a couple times a week and then more during breaks. We are fronting his room and board and that\u2019s it. (Obviously lots of small things too like dorm room essentials etc) The rest he is paying out of pocket or has a loan. He also chose a great school that isn\u2019t outrageously expensive. I think the fact that he is immediately paying for his education will help him appreciate it more (as far as being responsible with his classes).",

With our first we utilized the dependent care account which is $5000 per year so we\u2019d just put the lump sum in a 529 when we got reimbursed. It\u2019s been much, much harder with two kids, daycare, and inflation though.

It's sort of new territory for me. I was never taught about anything  other than savings accounts and cds, so stocks is kind of intimidating for me, but a friend of mine who is super smart was telling me about index funds and they seem like a sure bet. \n\nIt doesn't necessarily have to be for college. It could be just used as an investment. I just remember how hard my life has been from 18-33. I lived in poverty with student debt and have struggled a lot. I put off having kids because of not being able to afford them. Now we're doing alright for ourselves and I just don't want my daughter to go through that experience.",

And I get anxious about parking too much in a 529. On the one hand, I like the mental discipline of knowing the $$ I put in the 529 is for my kids, and I won\u2019t end up touching it for any other reason. Also, I was happy to hear that if my kids do get scholarships, I can withdraw that amount from the 539 without penalty. Still I can\u2019t help but wonder, what if one or both doesn\u2019t go to college?\n\nSo my goal is to put about half of what I think I will likely need for each kid in a 529, and have the other half (and any funds to pay for a nicer school) through other vehicles.

I was a very naive 16 year old thinking my parents saved and always heard about savings bonds I got when I was very young. I worked my ass off in high school and got into a pretty good school when no one in my family had gone to college before.

I could save more, but I also like to spend now, take trips, nice things for all of us, enjoy life. \n\nIt\u2019s not really worth the sacrifice to save $250k to pay for a state school because the cost of education is beyond ridiculous. The system is broken, I will save what I am able and willing, but I am not losing sleep over it.

I know that's not a TON in regards to current tuition rates, but would be a huge step in the right direction.\n\nIf you can double that to $50/week, you're looking at over $100,000 by the time they're 18.\n\nIt's a great gift option as well.

My oldest has graduated college/owes no money, other daughter has license to do hair and youngest going to University this year. Let your kids work for it also.

It must be really hard and a weight upon your shoulders to have to consider this when your child is so young. I hope you can help make their dreams come true! But if you can invest a portion every month in an ETF like S&P500. You can\u2019t panic and when there is a bear market, but historically, in a 18 year span like you pretend, it will always grow to a significant proportion, but you can only add to it, and not sell until the appointed time.

                "They will figure it out.  I believe unless you play a sport or have a scholarship or other specific reason not to then everyone should start out at a community college. They have few waivers. They have federal and state grants. It\u2019s SO much cheaper. I have 4 kids and my daughter just graduated with her bachelors. She owes a quarter of what her friend owes in loans. She got her AA at a community, she worked on campus. When she transferred they gave her 12k for transferring to get her BA. She got 10k while she was going to community college. Every student has to fill out the fafsa to get student aid. There is also fee waivers. My son got 13 K in 2 yrs at community he starts at a university next week and was also given money towards that for transferring. He said where the other students in his dorm are already 2 yrs in debt he\u2019s not. My other son did start at a university but that\u2019s because he plays football. High schools hate when students go to community. They try to talk you out of it. I\u2019d more schools talked up community college more kids would go and adults. I said I was thinking about enrolling in a few classes just for that 13 k in my pocket. There are also so many scholarships. My son got one for an essay on why mind craft is good for kids to play. They have them for everything. And then there are student loans for the rest. You just have to be smart. It doesn\u2019t matter what college you start at it matter where you finish. And many of the professors at the community college teach the same classes at the university.",

                "I think you should take some pressure off yourself.  For one thing, you have a LONG time to go and with the constant conversations about colleges and debt, it won't surprise me of there are changes in society by then.  It probably won't be a full-scale change, but it'll be something.  My daughter is in college now and when we started to save for her, people were already thinking, \"Does it make sense to pay $250K for an English degree?  That's an awful lot of money for a degree that doesn't do much.\"  And it didn't \"change\" from her birth to when she applied to college, but the overall conversation around expensive english degrees HAS changed a TON.\n\nIn 2000, people didn't really bat an eye if you say a kid with a liberal arts degree from a private college.  But in 2023, the assumption is either rich parents OR dumbass with student loans for a dump degree.  \n\nIt's like how people look at someone how lives in an apartment complex and drives a Ferrari with a $3K monthly payment.  We don't admire that person because they have a Ferrari, we just think they're a dumbass who should get a Civic and spend their money more wisely.  \n\nSo, I'm sure there will be some change in things again by the time your kiddo applies.  And I hope that takes some heat off you.  Even now, I don't think parents should feel pressured to pay cash-money for whatever college a child wants and then let them major in whatever they want.  Nobody thinks you're a bad parent if you can't send your kid to a private school to major in History.....and you're not denying them anything either.  Tbh, you can read history books at home and watch YouTubes of harvard professors for free and get the same education.  You don't get the piece of paper that says, \"BA in History from ABC College\", but nobody values that degree anyway in 2023, lol.  And it'll be even less valued in ~2040 when you face this.  \n\nAnd what you do get at college is the social experience of being away from home and having to decide for yourself how many beers you should drink tonight when you have  test tomorrow.  Or whether you should talk to the girl who is flirting with you or not talk to her.  Which group of kids to hang with.  And that experience is pretty much the same everywhere.  Granted, you form a stronger network at Harvard than at other schools, but it's not clear to me that once you dip below \"Ivy League networking\" that the next few tiers are all that different.  I went to a university that is only one notch down and none of my college friends is anything remarkable, lol.  I mean, they're leading nice adult lives, but it's not like their so connected they can help me get better jobs.  :)\n\nSo don't sweat it so much.",

He's got another three years of high school, and should have something like $40K by the time he graduates.\n\nBut the plan is for him to attend a CC or trade school out of high school and then transfer to a 4-year university when he knows what he wants to do or get his certs and get working.  CC here is heavily subsidized so that portion of his education should cost us under $10K all-in.  The rest can go to pay for his 3rd year and we'll try to help with anything else, but he's going to probably need loans for the last of it.  Assuming it's not trade school.",

                "(Article)\n\n----\n\n\nBritain will spend more on old-age pensions in two years\u2019 time than on education, policing and defence combined, official figures show.\n\nPension costs have risen sharply for years because of the government\u2019s \u201ctriple lock\u201d, the mechanism by which pensions rise by whichever is higher of the annual increase in average earnings, inflation or 2.5 per cent.\n\nLast year, pension costs increased by \u00a36 billion to \u00a3110 billion. By 2025 they are expected to have ballooned to \u00a3135 billion, a figure \u00a32 billion more than the combined day-to-day budgets for the Department for Education, the Home Office and the Ministry of Defence, Times analysis shows.\n\nThe departments receive separate funding for capital projects, to be spent on investment or future growth. A government source said: \u201cThat\u2019s the cost that comes with protecting the old. They can\u2019t get jobs, most people can, for many it\u2019s their only sole source of income.\u201d\n\nBut experts said that the triple lock was becoming \u201cunsustainable\u201d at a time of huge planned budget cuts across Whitehall over the next five years.\n\nA third of people do not believe the state pension will exist in 30 years\u2019 time, with those who voted Leave in the EU referendum and 2019 Tory voters feeling most pessimistic, according to polling by the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank (IFS) and Abrdn Financial Fairness Trust.\n\nThe rise in pension spending is in part due to the ageing population, with the full impact of the late 1950s/early 1960s baby boom not yet having taken effect. Between April 2026 and 2028 the state pension age will rise to 67, and the plan is to raise it further to 68 between 2044 and 2046. However, a review is due.\n\nA second government source said there was little that could be done to ease the cost in the short-term and that future decisions would be a \u201cproblem for the next government\u201d. In the year to August 2022, the number of people receiving a state pension rose by 130,000 to 12.6 million.\n\nSir Steve Webb, the former Liberal Democrat pensions minister, said that as well as pension spending increasing, NHS and social care spending would rise to deal with the higher health costs of looking after more elderly people. He suggested ministers would eventually be forced to raise taxes.\n\nHe said: \u201cPensioners are a protected group electorally, so the state pension gets protected. The NHS is a kind of national religion and is protected. And therefore everything else gets squeezed.\u201d\n\nWebb said defence, schools and working-age benefits had already suffered but added: \u201cThe time will come when none of those things can be squeezed anymore, and that\u2019s when the crunch really comes.\u201d\n\nThe triple lock led to the state pension increasing by 10.1 per cent this year. Both main parties have committed themselves to keeping the triple lock until 2030.\n\nBoth Lord Hague of Richmond, the former Tory leader and Times columnist, and the IFS have said the triple lock is \u201cunsustainable\u201d.\n\nThe Tory peer Baroness Altmann, a former pensions minister, said: \u201cI don\u2019t think the triple lock is a sensible policy.\u201d\nShe proposed a \u201cdouble lock\u201d based on inflation and earnings but said money could also be saved by raising the number of years of national insurance contributions needed to qualify for a state pension.\n\nCurrently that is set at 35, but Altmann said this could be increased to 45 with those without a full record being eligible for a proportionate amount based on their contribution. \u201cIt would save money but still retain the principles that are so important to the system,\u201d she said.\n\nThe IFS/Financial Fairness Trust research found that 15 per cent of people did not expect to retire until their seventies, and 13 per cent did not expect to retire at all. The survey also showed that 47 per cent expected to be less comfortable than their parents. Those aged between 50-64 were among those who believed they would be less well off than their parents, despite their parents on average having accumulated much less wealth than them.\n\nThe IFS has said that if the state pension age rises as planned, the share of those over state pension age would rise from 24 per cent today to 27 per cent in 2050 and then to 30 per cent in 2070.\n\nBut Altmann said governments would simply have to accept that the state pension bill would continue to rise. She said: \u201cUnless you\u2019re recommending euthanasia or mass poverty for elderly pensioners, how else would you do it?\u201d",

That would be grossly unfair on those who have made sacrifices earlier in life to enjoy a better retirement.  Instead I would suggest a sliding scale - say withdrawing \u00a31 of state pension for every \u00a35 of other income above a suitable threshold (say \u00a310k per year).  This would also need to be phased in over time so that existing retirees are not suddenly made worse off.\n\nIn addition, private pensions and other passive income should be taxed on the same basis as income from employment which effectively has a base rate of 32% thanks to national insurance.  This could be achieved by charging NI on passive income (why should only workers contribute?) or simply merging NI and Income Tax into a consolidated income tax.\n\nBy making wealthier pensioners shoulder some of the burden, we can ensure a basic state pension is available to all at a decent level and from a decent retirement age.",

            "selftext": "**I am NOT the Original Poster. That is** u/SchoolAppealNo. They posted in r/AmItheAsshole.\n\n**Mood Spoiler:** >!Positive ending!<\n\n**Original** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zz8o0u/aita_for_not_appealing_to_the_school_to_get_my/)**: December 30, 2022**\n\nSo my daughter (14) is in 8th grade and the whole school is by the public highschool. There is a program that allows 8th grades to go experience the basics of chemistry, biology, med, and engineering classes. The kids would go over to the highschool in the morning for a class and miss there elective of the day, so like art class or gym class. Its a pretty good program but it is only for the top students in middle school, basically the best of the best. They also do it for students who are great at literature or arts, but my daughter falls into the science one. My oldest kids before her both did it but my middle child didn't get in.\n\nSo my daughter gets in trouble a lot, sometimes it for small things for not having her stuff for class but other times its for more important things. Just this year she picked the lock to a art classroom to get some coloring tools. I am talking to the principal at least once or twice a year. Not the mention how many times she has come home with a pink slip (its like a warning). She's the class clown and really bright. No punishment that I have tried made it stop.\n\nSo today we got the letters who will be getting into the program, it will start next week until she graduates. If you don't get in the letter always tells you why, usually its your grades. Well we opened it today and it basically said she had the grades to do it but due to her discipline record they will not except her into the program. She was very upset and asked me to try to appeal it. There is a process for the school but I told her no. That this is the consequence of her actions and that I have warned her they will catch up. She called me an ass, and my husband is also not happy about what I said\n\n**Edit:** She has been evaluated (all the kids were), we also thought she was bored with class so she got moved up and she flunked out. She has been to therapy, but we stopped after she refused to talk to anyone. We tried for 9 months, she would sit in silence.\n\n***Relevant Comments:***\n\n*More info on the program:*\n\n\"The school always did chemistry in highschool but its the college class ones. So you take it there and it will count towards college.(if you want) I know they did biology in middle school but the highschool biology is more advance.\"\n\n*Is the program the entire year?*\n\n\"Its about 4 months, its until she graduates 8th grade. Its basically a month of each subject, a sneak peak into the classes. I also don't think I could pull her if she was in the program, it would be a big hassle to the school and I doubt they would want to do that. I could try but I doubt that would work\"\n\n*Could she just be bored with the class she is in?*\n\n\"She was moved to a higher class, we thought the same thing. She failed out of it in the trail run.\"\n\n***OOP is voted NTA***\n\n**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/158m9q4/update_aita_for_not_appealing_to_the_school_to/)**: July 24, 2023 (7 months later)**\n\nIt's been a while since the post and some asked for an update with the whole situation. So after the post I took the suggestion of a few people and had here do the whole process to get an appeal from the school. So she did the paperwork and prepared to plead her case to the heads of the program.\n\nShe did pretty well and wrote a pretty good essay on why she wanted to appeal and why she believes she should be in the program. She also did well when she was pleading her case to the heads of the program which was a science teacher. She is a strict women and I didn't expect much when it happened, and my daughters appeal did not go through. The science teacher when asked broke down why she was not accepting the appeal, I wish she was nicer (she was professional, just a tad blunt) about it but it boiled down to they do not trust her to not distract other students or trust her to behave during labs. She basically was a safety risk that the teacher did not wish to put up with and it would be unfair to the other student. I agree with this.\n\nMy daughter did not take it well when that happened and hurled some insults at the teacher which proved her point. She was punished for that, and was quite upset about missing the program. It really helped her to mature though. She stopped being the class clown, started to focus on stuff and just behaved. I wasn't called in for the rest of the year. I was worried her attitude would change during the summer but that didn't happen.\n\nSo we sent her to a STEM camp during the summer since she was interested and she was good, the people gave her glowing reviews and she has a real talent for engineering. She is also happier in general, and her missing the program helped her make friends outside of her friend group. She is still good friends with her friend group that went to the program\n\nNow she will be starting highschooler soon and she is going to take some classes with her friends that went to the program. She is going into the chemical and engineering track, which she is really excited for.\n\nThank you for everyone that responded on the post when it first came up, everything really seems to be looking up",

Even just knowing that something is fucky in your brain and is causing certain thought-trains/impulses can help to prompt you to recognize it and then rein it back in. That might be harder as a teenager, with everything else going on in your brain soup at that point; so again, that's where the medication and therapy could help. But as someone who didn't realize they had ADHD until I was in my 30s, I often wonder about how things might have played out differently if it was caught earlier.\n\n(I mean, I'm still unmedicated and have never gone to therapy for it, because I was already dealing with chronic migraines when I had the full realization and got the ADHD diagnosis, and the doctor thought that medication might worsen the migraines.

Like, worst-case scenario, if it makes the migraines worse we can just go back off the medication, even if it takes a little bit to ramp back down or whatever).",

I met Luke when  Julia was a freshman so I was aware that he offered to pay her schooling for 6 years, that was their deal. Luke started his adulthood with a lot of debt from school and didn't want Julia to go through any of that, he only wanted her to focus on getting an education. His business was successful so he paid for her tuition, apartment, car note, food, and other expenses (gas money, phone bill, clothing allowance, etc). He has spent close to $300,000 in 6 years. \n\nLuke and I run our businesses together and we combined finances after getting married, his business generates 10-15% more revenue than mine. Four months ago we had a discussion with Julia and asked her what her plans were regarding her future after school, she said she wanted to stay near her friends so Luke helped her secure a position where the starting salary was in the low six figure range. We decided that we would give her a rental property so that she would not pay rent, she would only be responsible for the utilities. \n\nSix weeks ago Julia's plans changed. She quit her job and told us that she wants to continue her education in the UK- a second Master's Degree and her PHD after. She's expecting us to pay for it. Luke discussed it with me and I told him that she should take out a loan. He paid for 6 years of schooling, pulled strings to get her into her career of choice, and we gave her a free place to stay. I don't think it's fair that we pay another $200-300,000 for Julia to avoid working and not deal with responsibilities. Luke agrees but he's a bit of a pushover. I reminded Luke that we have shared finances and my business brings in almost just as much as his, therefore I also have a say in this. \n\nJulia has been complaining to her parents and all of our relatives that I am denying her a chance to \"succeed at life.\" Luke's aunt says that it's only fair that we continue paying for her to attend university since Luke was the one who offered her a debt free education. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAITA for putting my foot down and not allowing my husband to continue paying his sister's education since I bring in half of our income?

I got off and went to the gym and put in hard work like I was training for competition, then I\u2019d go to community college and ask hard questions and study for the next class. Even though I was working a job that only paid me 10 bucks an hour, I did the work like I was supervisor. I lived my whole life in a way that I was proud of. Unfortunately that plan and vision never panned out and I had to know when I expended all my resources and tried something new. \n\nThen when I went on my next venture, I carried myself the same way and people noticed and it paid off. I started a new job at 20 an hour. Then after a year, a positioned opened up and I applied for it and now I\u2019m getting 30 an hour. In 2 years I tripled my income and I\u2019m happy with my work. It doesn\u2019t happen over night, but the hard work adds up and pays off. \n\nJust remember you get out what you put in, and how you do one thing is how you do everything. Envision a plan, map it out, and work for it. You have no one to rely on but yourself. Now that I\u2019m in a good position, I\u2019m making what people who spent 8 years in college are making and I have no student debt. Community college can pay off. I\u2019m  an example of a success story of community college, and there\u2019s countless examples of people who went to college for 8 years and can\u2019t get a job. It\u2019s not where you went to school, it\u2019s what skills and qualities you have as a person.",

As a non medical professional person I can say quite confidently you do not need to worry about AI taking over that field. There is nuance in the view that the physicians ask for. This includes patient positioning. In order for AI to do it, the doctor would either need to be even more hands on and direct it on how to perform the scan or you\u2019d need a person to do that\u2026 which we already have.

I\u2019m in a SOC Analyst right now and can give some good insight into how the career path is shaping out right now. \n\nWe have a massive influx of cyber security graduates, and no entry level jobs for them to get. This is because cyber security in nature, is not an entry level career. Historically infosec people had years (5-10) of solid IT background before getting into security. This is is what the fresh cyber security graduates are up against. Most employers will take someone with an IT background, passion for infosec, and an irrelevant degree over someone with a bachelors in cyber security and no experience, in a heart beat. \n\nIf you want to get in cyber security the best recipe to follow is get at least an AA in an IT relevant course, study for a few relevant certs (SEC+ and CCNA is the sauce) and then work a couple years help desk/desktop support. Not only that but build a homelab, break some systems and then fix them and document your experience. This shows that you actually want it, have the drive to keep learning, and are passionate. This is a gold star entry level candidate for cyber security. \n\nI practiced what i just preach and it worked a charm.

It doesn't mean you'll have to do exactly that, but it can give you a guideline to what kind of work you'd enjoy. For example, I enjoy being creative and I like problem solving. That's a huge part of my job now, problem solving.\n\nTry to find a position that's close to entry level. I always recommend getting a sales position. They don't need people with a specific degree, they need people who can sell stuff. Then from there, start networking. Show up to happy hour events, talk to people outside of your department. If you find someone you get along with, ask them if they're willing to mentor you. Also, create a LinkedIn and add every single person you have some sort of professional interaction with.\n\nI went from selling shit door to door to making six figures in the span of about 8 years by doing those things.\n\nOf course there is a lot more to it, but that's the short answer. If anyone has any further questions, please feel free to drop a comment. I'd love to help anyone I can.",

                "I was 28 when I went to a coding boot camp and got a job as a junior software developer. I then finished my bachelors degree in CS a month before I turned 30. (I had a bunch of random credits from switching degrees over the years, which helped me complete it soon after the boot camp). \n\nMy uncle went to nursing school in his late 40s and became an RN when he was 50. \n\nAll that to say, it\u2019s never too late. I\u2019m sure other people have said it but you\u2019re 26 and wishing you started sooner. In 4 years, you\u2019ll be 30 and if you don\u2019t start something, you\u2019ll be wishing you started when you were 26. Only gets harder as you get older. \n\nI understand feeling worthless, it\u2019s a tough feeling. But at least you see what you don\u2019t want (lacking a more meaningful career) at 26. If you don\u2019t want to do a full 4 year degree, or continue with radiography, find a trade school, construction trades are in dire need and you can make a great living. Some of the larger utility companies offer paid apprenticeship programs to learn certain skills. And paid pretty well too. $50-$70k while you\u2019re learning and guaranteed job when you finish making a lot more. A lot of people shit on the military but it\u2019s also a good route if you\u2019re able. Learn a skill, get paid, and they\u2019ll pay for college when you get out. There\u2019s other branches other than Army and Marine Corps that will provide a different quality of life. Had a friend who joined at 28, he was the \u201cgrandpa\u201d of his basic training squadron. When he\u2019s 48, he\u2019ll be getting a retirement if he gets out then and almost guaranteed a job when he gets out if he does it right. \n\nThe amount of options are what make it hard to decide but don\u2019t let you being 26 affect starting something or not. You can always change course later on but it\u2019s easier to do when you have a career to fall back on than if you don\u2019t.",

I did exactly what you're planning to do, got my BSME and now in my late 30's,  make close to $200k/yr. \n\nStarted at 4 year university and bombed second semester through partying, dropping out over the summer. Took a couple years to figure myself out and got serious about my education and started back at a community college, retaking my freshmen casses because I barely/didn't pass them. \n\nSeveral things- \n-The professors at community colleges usually have a full time job outside of school. They teach because its a passion and this comes through in the class room. \n\n- Its obviously cheaper than a university. \n\n- Because the community colleges realizes most people have day jobs, way more flexibility in class schedule. \n\nMy community college had a 2+2 program with the university where all my first two year classes would transfer - check to see if yours has the same. \n\nAfter two years, I had my associates, allowing me to obtain a job at a company that had a really nice tuition reimbursement program. \n\nWhen I took my 300 level courses at the university, I  knew the foundations very well, allowing me to easily get my bachelors. \n\nSuggestion - Commit. Do it. Believe in yourself. I printed out the class list for my degree the first semester back and crossed out the classes as I finished them. It will be slow at first, but soon it will make you eager to finish. \n\nFigure out your learning style. I'm a horrible procrastenator so online courses were a no for me. Go to every class. I learn way better when I write (rather than just listen) so I was furiously taking notes/copying what the professors wrote on the board. \n\nDon't take summers off. Take at least one class during the summer. This will continue your momentum and keep you in the right mindset. \n\nRounding it out, I took some business courses after getting my bachelors and that allowed me to get into a more manager/BD role in an engineering company.",

As you are a student, you may be able to access free or cheap counselling services from your school. Take advantage of as much as you possibly can.  Because as you clear out your beliefs about yourself, these decisions will be a hell of a lot easier.",

Worth it. Got my associates a few years ago.\n\nNow I'm nearly 30 and about to transfer to a four year university to do a bachelor's program.\n\nSeriously. Take as much time as you need. My associates program was niche, so I was the youngest person in all of my classes except for one core class.",

The last few years I averaged 150-170k per year. Power plant jobs are out there and like me a lot of the workforce is retiring. If you can get a two year technical degree you have the aptitude for high tech power plant work. Or go into the power plant trades. All pay well and offer great benefits.

Constant societal change all but requires younger generations not to accept some of the lessons or teachings of the older generation.\n\nI do absolutely agree that young people sometimes get blamed for what they have not been taught, but similarly putting all of the blame on the older generation seems overly simplistic and a convenient cop out.",

People are dressing differently, listening to music you don't like, all the celebrities you grew up with are dieing or retiring while newer young ones are coming up to replace them. Bottom line is you(and your generation)now long define what's cool. You now longer have a finger on the pulse of culture.\n\nSome people resent this.

When I took sign language classes, I had a meeting with a professor who was deaf outside of class (long story). She started asking me questions verbally, which I tried to answer by signing. Thankfully one of her first questions was if I wanted an interpreter. (Which I had tried to schedule days in advance, but I was told none were available\u2026 though when the professor requested they were available -_-)",

                "Since I'm getting some questions I thought I'd give some context.\n\n# Yes, they really did try to get deaf kids to learn to hear & talk.\n\nThe issue is two things that the hearing often don't know about the deaf community. The first is that many deaf students can either already read lips fairly well from interacting with their hearing parents. The other is that many persons sent to schools for the deaf were just severely hard of hearing. Additionally, there was a (now disproven) belief at the time called Lamarckism. The followers of Lamarck incorrectly thought evolution was guided by intentions & skills learned in childhood. The Lamarck version of evolution said if the kids tried really hard [their genes wouldn't be deaf genes anymore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamarckism). You cant make this stuff up. The eugenicists were so dominant in the European deaf community that Stalin made the Lamarck view of deaf teaching the official state policy of the Soviet Union, & shut down some deaf schools to try to mainstream deaf students.\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about the early twentieth century arguments over deaf students, I liked a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCg7Pda_3Gw) about the controversies surrounding Helen Keller learning to speak & her civil rights work on behalf of the deaf.",

Also, they slapped them when they tried to sign. Thankfully we are now on the so called \u201ebimodular-bilingual\u201c way, which means teacher use sign language and verbal language equal parts. \n\nThat beeing said, that only works well if you have 2 teacher per class, one who uses sign and one who uses verbal language.",

There were all kinds of efforts by researchers to prove that aphasia affects the deaf in the same way and that sign language has puns and poetry to force linguists to acknowledge it.\n\nIronically, despite demands that deaf children only use the oral method, the ones in residential schools (which was common) used improvised sign language among themselves, especially in the dorm rooms.\n\nThe languages they used went through the developmental stages, first being classifiable as a pidgin language, as students contributed various self-created signs, and then a creole language with a full-fledged grammar, which essentially gave credence to Chomskey's theories about deep structure and the innate human capacity to develop language.",

                "As a hearing person who tried to start learning ASL, I'd like to respectfully ask a question about Stokoe.  In the course I took, there was a strong sentiment that ASL should never be written down, with the argument that a non-phonemic language was inappropriate for reducing to a set of written symbols.  This made note taking and thus studying significantly harder.  To someone who's spent his career in natural language text processing, the notion of a language without a written form seems like it artificially takes away so many useful opportunities.\n\nWritten symbols certainly don't have to correspond to phonemes (some spoken languages don't have such a correspondence in their written form), or even sounds at all (electrical circuit diagram symbols, mathematical formula notation, etc), and still are very useful.  Stokoe was a proponent and inventor of one of the proposed systems of written notation for ASL which apparently failed to catch on.  Is this really a widespread notion?  Is there a reason for it beyond inertia?",

Like the questions she was asking and the way she was behaving around patients\u2014it was something you would expect of a first or second year student. She didn\u2019t know how to boost a patient. She didn\u2019t know to close the curtain before changing a patient. She didn\u2019t know what a sublingual medication was. She didn\u2019t know that you should look at patient\u2019s orders before going in to assess them. Like reaaally basic things. Also, every single little thing that came up with a patient was an emergency to her and she would come running to us for help. Her prioritization skills were absolutely non existent.\n\nAnd we work in a neuro rehab unit. Our patients don\u2019t even have the acuity of med surg. They are all medically stable. So to see her struggling so much was really mind boggling. We tried to help her out but we basically ended up caring for the patients ourselves cause she was completely clueless. \n\nShe is from another country (India) and says she was an RN over there. She was not able to practice as an RN over here but they allowed her to obtain an LPN license and she is eligible to write the NCLEX to obtain her RN. \n\nI know the standards of nursing education differ from country to country but I highly suspect that she doesn\u2019t have formal training as a nurse anywhere and falsified her proof of education somehow. I\u2019m not sure how I would be able to prove it but I really suspect it. I\u2019ve never seen a new nurse who didn\u2019t at least know the basics.

She was learning a new language (she had to learn Arabic in Qatar and then English for America), adjusting to a new country, a new hospital system, etc. She had a notebook that she would write down words that were commonly used here that she wasn\u2019t completely familiar with. She would study them to familiarize herself with \u201cour\u201d terms. For example, for an IV, she would say \u201ccannula.\u201d If someone, in foreign language, in a foreign country, told me to \u201cplace a cannula,\u201d I would look at them bewildered, too. And as for putting IV\u2019s in elderly people, she laughed about that later on saying elderly people in India simply don\u2019t go to the hospital so she didn\u2019t know how to stabilize the saggy, wrinkly skin. She was shocked that she had so many old patients because she never had to deal with that as often as she did in America. She was just all around nervous\u2026it was a huge adjustment for her. But nothing about those little things made me think her education and experience were fake.\n\nNow, I did have an experience with a traveler a few years ago that made me question the validity of his \u201clicense.\u201d He was drawing up insulin for a patient. At that time, we still did dual sign off. He came to us using a heparin syringe. We told him that was the wrong syringe and showed him where the insulin needles were.

                "Hey OP, I actually got to spend a week in India during nursing school as part of a leadership program to see how nursing education differed between the two countries. This is a grain of salt because I 1) wasn\u2019t a full nurse yet, 2) we mostly interacted with nursing students and professors,  and 3) I don\u2019t want to say my one experience is the standard across the whole country. \n\nThe education that they received was very similar to ours - I would argue it was even harder than the states. Their tests were essays, the students had to *learn English* for school, and when we participated in a clinical day they cooked food for the patient while educating them on diabetes management/nutrition (they even whipped out a chemistry set to test the patient\u2019s urine for glucose). Their school had their own sim lab, library, etc. \n\nI think the biggest thing is the cultural difference. They know and learn the principles of something like hand hygiene, but resources can be scarce (especially at government hospitals). And there is definitely a huge cultural distinction (e.g. nurses didn\u2019t wear shoes in mom/baby units as a cultural norm despite needles being on the ground, and HIPAA just isn\u2019t a thing as the students literally took pictures of me with patients in the community).\n\nI don\u2019t know the nurse\u2019s system for reviewing orders, or the exact cultural norm on curtains and privacy, but I would give them the benefit of the doubt that those are just different norms compared to the states. In terms of franticness, I\u2019ve seen a handful of nurses here that everyone rolls their eyes at because they\u2019re sprinting across the unit for a suture removal kit to remove a central line.",

Not every country does the same assessments or does it the same way.  For example, in Germany, you need extra training and a certification to use a stethoscope and do a head to toe exam!\n\nI mean, should she have been given an LPN?   Seems likely she maybe should not have.   But most of these problems are cultural differences, I would guess.\n\nI have definitely seen new grads as clueless.  How long was she on orientation? Did she get a good one, the same as a new grad would get?",

                "Well first she could just be super nervous - working in a new country with different ways to do things. I worked with a girl from another country - she also seemed very lost. But after speaking to her nursing there was different - they never boosted, repositioned, or even washed their patients it was the families job. She allowed a patient to leave the hospital for a meal with family because it was what she was use to. She was use to reviewing the chart, getting the medications, and handing the medications over to the family to give to the patient - now she was having to give the medications and she didn\u2019t always know what they were for or how to give because she never gave them. This is why many facilities in America are giving international nurses a lot of extra time in training because our way or nursing is much different than many other countries. \n\n\nAlso, a few things I would equally make the same \u201cmistake\u201d she did - I\u2019m not use to working in an area with double rooms so my first time working in a double room the other patient was not in the room, the door was shut, but I forgot the other patient or their family could walk in at anytime. I learned to pull the curtain after that. I also don\u2019t always look up orders before I assess my patient (especially if I don\u2019t have access to a computer) many times I go assess my patient then look up the chart in their room. This also allows me to be more unbiased with my assessment.",
                "Funny enough. RNs in India differ from hospital to hospital. A lot of them an RN is simply a PCA with no nursing education. So your suspicion may be accurate.

                "Adding my 2 cents as someone about to graduate in the fall (practicum is next semester, which certainly will play a role, so take that into account).\nI am at one of the best schools in my state, and mostly have been commended by nurses so far for doing well on the floor, so our cohort is probably not the worst offenders. BUT I will tell you the emphasis on teaching for us is passing the NCLEX. We have had competencies for skills throughout, but they are fairly general, vague, and not emphasized like passing exams. Catheters might be one of my better areas. And I am decent (though very slow) with drawing up syringes. I have never been on a sublingual med pass. Taking blood glucose is something I only really learned as a nurse extern. And the other day I had a nurse get fairly irate with me because I didn\u2019t know how to perform a bed bath well. I used 2 wash cloths when I should use 10 or more, and CHG only confuses the matter for me. To be fair, as a male, I\u2019ve had most people refuse a bath from me in favor of a female throughout clinicals and orientation. I have a better understanding now after reviewing the research, and probably would even insist on using CHG cloths more or frequently changing water in the basin.\nMy point is about the foundation for skills. They don\u2019t teach us how to insert IV\u2019s or draw labs. Practical skills are written off as a monkey can be taught how to do that. This concerns me though. It does seem like an EMT program, for instance, does a better job of teaching the foundation for practical skills now. \nIt\u2019s great that I know when to hold Digoxin, but being comfortable getting labs is also a key factor, and this scares me. \nAnyway, we can\u2019t change the educational system, especially in other countries, but we can be thorough in assessing what people actually know versus where perspective is different. Easier said than done I\u2019m sure. Almost every experience I\u2019ve had so far with nurses precepting has been incredibly supportive and I am in awe of how welcoming and wonderful they are as teachers when they have their own responsibilities! I can\u2019t really imagine handling that myself, so thank you to anyone out there that puts themselves in this role.",

An experienced ICU nurse, especially a traveler who takes these tests for every contract, would never fail a tele test. \n\nI shared my concerns with the person who led the first orientation day. The educator revealed having the same concerns. The nurse came back for the couple of more days we were meant to orient together but I never did see her work in the ICU.\n\nThe sooner you speak up, the sooner the educator can be mindful to look for concerns, and stop a terrifying thing from happening.",
                "I've run into this with international travelers before. At my last facility we had a handful of girls (and a guy) from Nepal... Most of them were excellent caregivers, but 2 of them were absolutely clueless. One of them we were pretty sure didn't really speak English, and instead of asking for help or clarification when given instructions, she just nodded and smiled, and then continued on as though nothing was said. This was in a critical care setting, at the height of COVID, so much of what occurred went unnoticed, since the majority of the patients died within a few weeks/days  no matter who was caring for them. I questioned one of them about her critical care experience, and what she said killed me inside, but unfortunately didn't surprise me. She told me that the agency that brought her over literally told all of them to check off every box on their paperwork, saying that they had experience in all kinds of treatment modalities (crrt, balloon pumps, invasive pressure monitoring, etc.) regardless of whether they had actually been trained on it. Her recruiter told her that all nurses in the US worked with all of these things all the time, and that they wouldn't be able to be placed if they didn't say that they could do the same. These two came over at a different time than the rest, so it's possible that while they were from the same agency, they had a different recruiter, because as I said, the rest were all either highly skilled, or were at least able to cover and learn on the fly. I have nothing against international travelers as individuals, but the system that uses and abuses them is totally disgusting and unsafe.",

Healthcare and terms and language is MUCH different there than here. She may not know how to \u201cboost\u201d a patient. That\u2019s a slang term that we use. Try to speak in more descriptive sentences. Patience with her is going to go a long way. Remember she may have been THE rockstar in INDIA but here our system is different.

If you ever has suspicions I think you have a duty to report, and getting someone properly educated protects everyone (the nurse, your patient, yourself) never a bad thing to make sure someone has the correct training. \n\nHowever, everyone saying you are targeting international nurses isn\u2019t being fair. It\u2019s a known thing not all countries or providences in countries have the same practice standards at all. Nursing is impacted by this while docs and the like are too. If someone can pass our nclex and practice safely I would never judge but our expectation for nursing is very different than many areas around the world. Valuable work but it\u2019s not a direct cross always or often it heavily depends on the country, area, school, etc. I have worked with amazing international nurses, I\u2019ve also worked with some where it was obvious levels of care here blew their minds and training out of the water.

The research challenges the common belief that a minimum of 30 minutes of daily physical activity is necessary for mental health benefits, as even shorter durations of exercise have shown positive effects.\n\nThe study specifically focused on \u201cmoderate to vigorous physical activity,\u201d such as brisk walking, and discovered that engaging in this level of activity for 20 minutes a day resulted in a 16% lower rate of depressive symptoms and a 43% lower likelihood of major depression.\n\n\nLead author Dr. Eamon Laird explained that the objective was to determine the minimum amount of physical activity that could provide protection against depression. While there is no consensus on the exact dosage, the study found that longer durations of activity correlated with greater protection. Thirty minutes of daily activity resulted in a 7% lower rate of depressive symptoms and a 44% lower likelihood of major depression, while up to 120 minutes per day showed a 23% lower risk of depressive symptoms and a 49% lower likelihood of major depression\n\nhttps://www.samaaenglish.tv/news/40041990/health-act-now-20-minute-brisk-walks-can-dramatically-reduce-depression-risk-study",

The current trend is pathetic, I\u2019d say. The focus now is more on the NRI status and part time job aspect rather than studying, students are now opting for universities with sub par standards and opting diploma courses of 1 year duration rather than doing a proper 2 year masters program, reason? The 2 year masters program requires more work to be put in to complete the course without any backlogs, this also prevents them from focusing more on the part time jobs. And these agencies are glorifying this as if they\u2019ve helped these students get admissions in top 10 universities of the respective country, that\u2019s not the case at all, most of the colleges they go to are legit taking anyone in just to fill the seats and their pockets. There\u2019s a lot bts happening in their trend man, I could go on and on about it.

Think of it. \n\nNot all students can afford University education abroad, so they have to apply colleges and do part time and support their family then pay back loan etc. \n\nI can say confidently none of the students I assisted for the student visa process returns to India due to lack of job/ being ineligible for PR etc all can settle with in 3-5 years. \n\nThose who have no burden of looking after family, construct house, financial liability, no dreams of living/settling abroad/no property to pledge for loan/ unsupportive parents etc can study here and please don't think or spread negatives like this. \n\nNB: not the case of UK/USA/Europe applicable for Canada only.",

I was watching an old episode of Maude from the 70\u2019s\u2026 how has so little changed in 50 years? So little. It seems the issue of equality in America is much more complex than teaching a course people actively use in harmful ways. I\u2019m not surprised Arkansas is trying something new to get the strong divide to end, since hyper education about the divide hasn\u2019t given us equality for so many decades. The idea that we should just be equal, work hard to succeed, stop dwelling\u2026 it\u2019s definitely a different approach. I don\u2019t want people to suffer, I want them to flourish. Every race has been enslaved at one point or another. It just so happens that the Industrial Revolution, printing press, American culture encountered the one it encountered in time and space. I\u2019m black and gay, and I also think promoting hookup culture as the gay default has caused me a lot of sadness and harm. I\u2019ve seen so much sadness in my communities. I don\u2019t know what the answer is, but reducing the sadness and increasing more optimistic views, fewer pessimistic views\u2026 it\u2019s not been tried like this before."

In public schools there are more kids who HAVE to get jobs to support their own families who wouldn't even dream of having enough money to pay $10k a year for their child's education. This and other socioeconomic factors (including moves like this to defund and stretch budgets of public schools) are THE ONLY reason why test scores are higher in private schools\n\nThe freedom argument could just about be the most backwards take I've ever heard in my life. So now the private schools that are infamous for never letting any special needs kids in, and even if they do, there are no special ed programs or any special attention given to the kids who most certainly need it most. They also can deny anyone for any reason including sexual preference, disability, skin color, literally anything. Is that freedom? Equality? No. It is not. Iowa is trying to segregate it's schools with the poor, disabled, and non white people in public schools that are sucked dry of their funding, and kids that are let into private schools still paying the same tuition except now more of the schools admin can take huge raises year after year with the free budget room the state is handing out to them like welfare checks for existing.",

            "selftext": "Based in the UK. 3 kids (ages 9 to 12) and unsure about best path of education.\n\nMy own experience of the institutional education system is that the whole thing is one giant charade to keep children occupied and their parents distracted. I am not looking to produce worker bees through the grammar school model. Boarding school is the equivalent of saying \"I wish I didn't have kids\", plus what I have seen of them has left me far from impressed, all the way up to Eton. The badge of success for ambitious schools appears to be their ability to get children high enough grades to enter elite universities. However, I also do not have much faith in the elite university system, having been through it, and from what I now read about it. The whole exercise seems like a giant waste of a child's best learning years, whilst the institutions themselves reek of hive mind idiocracy. The prevailing ideological / political  dogmas are also concerning.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, I am considering the potential advantages of creating a personal tutoring programme for the kids that will enable them to pursue their potential in a much more aggressive manner across a range of disciplines, which will mean pulling them out of institutional education completely. I am not looking to become a home schooler in the sense that the children need experts to lead their education. The best I can offer is to oversee the programme. Budget would be up to \u00a3250k p.a. though I suspect this is not necessary.\n\nDo you have experience of building this, or know people who have? I would love to know about the practicalities of the challenge, and also the outcomes. Whether it would be considered a success, etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thanks everyone for the comments (even the snarky ones). For clarification, I'm not considering this as a way to produce elite academic performers for the purpose of excelling within the system. That would be winning the rat race. It is more about having a very different curriculum. One that develops the whole human, so we can explore different subjects, not normally pursued institutionally. We can also dive deep into some of the traditional subjects in a different way. So, control over the curriculum coupled with 1:1 tutoring to ensure true learning.   \n\n\nIt would be great to hear more from / about people who have tried something like this.",

                "Consider what your kids may want in all of this. Parents too often swing the pendulum trying to mold their kids into what they want/weren\u2019t able to be. Don\u2019t forget that your children are actual human beings and not just an extension of you. \n\nThere\u2019s probably good reason most of the worlds wealthiest kids aren\u2019t homeschooled (nor were the brightest minds of today).",
                "I\u2019m involved on the other side of this (I tutor wealthy kids for fun) and this is what I will say. \n\nThink back to your favorite teacher. What set them apart? Didn\u2019t you like the class better because of them? Didn\u2019t they make you feel valued as an individual?\n\nGo out and find those tutors. The ones who care about the kids, and don\u2019t have so many students that your kid is a number. And then stay out of their way. \n\nI have parents who let me do whatever it takes to make their kid love math. It\u2019s hard to do when they hate math as a 9th grader, but we find math everywhere in life and work on that (last time I saw her she was going to another country so we did exchange rates and metric conversions. Like the important stuff). I have a lot of fun with my chemistry students- showing them how this is important in computer chips or in eating etc. interacting with students in their interests. \n\nAnd a lot of us exist, but we are hard to find. My mom is great on k-2 reading, but I have another friend who is amazing at middle and high school English. You almost have to find one and see who they know. And then you have to have one with a schedule that fits what you want (I do tech work during the day, so I can\u2019t teach until later).",
                "Our approach has been to figure out what your kids want and support it to the best of our ability without resorting to either homeschooling or boarding school.\n\nWe have opted not to homeschool mainly because we have zero patience for it and default to devices as it is. Also, every homeschooler we know has issues ranging from lack of social maturity vs peers, parents in denial about fairly obvious atypical neurological issues such as autism, anger management, etc., and future impacts on career/employability.\n\nMy spouse and I are the product of public schools (with two extremes in funding/academics - top US public high school and a super rural, underfunded small school) and as such, we are trying to give our kid a public education. We looked at Montessori and Wardorf (noped out of both options pretty quickly because they were just wrong for our kid) and are currently in a public IB school and are switching to a similar school in another country. \n\nWe supplement school with outside activities and have done speech therapy (COVID/moving continents) and I am considering getting a tutor because we are seeing some early signs of dyslexia which both my spouse I have. We do Khan Academy and I am considering maybe Beast Academy or Russian Math because my kid seems more math/science inclined but I want it to be more fun vs annoying. \n\nTo do it really well, you would need fantastic tutors in every subject which, with your budget and how criminally underpaid teachers at elite private schools in the UK are, would be totally doable (assume 40-50k per tutor a year vs the 20-30k which seems to be the average salary based on anecdotal data from a friend). However, is that what your kids want? Mine just wants to go to the playground and goes to after school care even though we were both home full time because they were bored and like being around kids.",

(It has the highest average test scores in the world). \n\nAt that university, I regularly encountered home schooled kids. And, by and large, while they were bright and well-educated, they were seriously lacking in social skills.\n\nThe issue is that, even if you\u2019re the sharpest knife, it\u2019s hard to advance through life and a career when you\u2019re awkward or alienate those around you.\n\nIn contrast, I knew plenty of people who went to small schools catering to precocious kids. These kids did much better, because they had more socialization.\n\nI am also considering home schooling my kids, but the biggest question is how you keep them from becoming\u2026 weirdos.",
                "A lot of what you wrote really resonated. \n\nI don\u2019t think schools are close to the optimum solution to the problem that we\u2019re trying to solve. As you say, they\u2019re basically fancy childcare. That said - I think the social value of going to a school is huge. So I am not sure how you solve this via tutoring. \n\nI\u2019m also UK based. I disagree with you about all the schools sucking entirely. I think some of the really good ones actually do have really high quality academic values (naming names, St. Paul\u2019s boys seems really excellent.). I\u2019m not as bothered as you are about them getting randomly indoctrinated. Until the age of about 10 I went to a school that believed the earth was about 3000 years old (I don\u2019t think my parents realized this btw\u2026) but I think I was fairly able to see that it was bs.\n\n[https://www.actonacademy.org/](https://www.actonacademy.org/) is worth taking a look. What is interesting about them is how they have meaningfully changed how education works (putting 4 years of kids in one class room\u2026) in a way that should make things a lot worse and it \u2026 hasn\u2019t made things worse, and has most likely made it better. I doubt you can replicate it here but its success shows just how non optimal the current system is.",

                "I used to work as a tutor for a super wealthy music manager whose bright daughters weren\u2019t challenged much at their private school. They did things like learn Chinese at home (as white Americans). I was brought in to teach history and English, and we did a curriculum that integrated the two for middle school. The daughter was very self-directed but she wanted to go to a public high school for the experience and she has gone onto a conventional college. I estimated it costed him about $50k annually to run his in-house homeschool that gave them a lot of flexibility. The dad even read some books with us to discuss them. It was very clear that his daughters felt closer to him and to their family as a result of the experience. \n\nMost families that I know who go the route of homeschooling doing so for some other reason than just dislike of the school system. For example, parents have unusual work schedules so they can get more family time. Or one child has special needs, so they homeschool all the kids to make things more relaxed for everyone.\n\nDespite having extremely mixed feelings about my Ivy League education, I would not want to set up my kids to have fewer opportunities than I had. There are some homeschooled students who get into Ivies but they do have to work harder for it. I know of two girls who were homeschooled - one went on to become a religious sister. The other is a conservative political activist and now mother. They definitely didn\u2019t \u201cfit in\u201d culturally as well, but at the end they have their diplomas and the option to use them as they see fit.",
                "Shrug. \n\nMy husband was homeschooled. It worked out ok for him, in that he went to a top university and then made a lot of money, but he absolutely did not want our kid to have that experience. It was very isolating. And no, \u201cother ways to socialize\u201d doesn\u2019t cut it. \n\nWhat we did is find a private school with extremely small class sizes that promises and delivers a lot of personalized attention \u2014 their core subjects are all taught in small groups with an average 4 kids, and when needed they offer one-on-one instruction (for example, for kids who flourish when accelerated or who need extra assistance). \n\nMaybe look for something like that and find opportunities to further nurture your kid\u2019s unique interests and talents outside of school. \n\nAnd for the love of god get therapy for yourself. You need to back way off on trying to craft your children into creative financial mavericks. Your homeschool fantasy is a fantasy. The reality isn\u2019t that. Let your kids be who they are, and realize that humans are social creatures and that EQ and social awareness is a massive part of success.",
                "All I would say is, being a former homeschooled kid, please take your kids need for socialization and friendship into account. As they enter their teen years, also give them a say in what they want their education to look like. These years are very important for developing their sense of identity. If you force a program on them (even a good one, but without their autonomy and needs taken into account), you will be pushing them through just another authoritarian system- just your own.

I on the other hand didn't really need it, but went to maths enrichment to train for competitions for a while out of my own will.

                "My children are already teenagers. So I am coming at your question from the US, and with children that are already on their way to having some degree of agency and skin in the game. While my children were very young (2.5-4) they attended a local preschool for half days. Primarily it was to socialize them and to get them to understand group dynamics. I would pick them up and provide lunch, then we would go to art class, music theory class, and a gym class (swimming, gymnastics, dance, soccer, softball, tennis) depending upon the season and desired interest of my children. We are in a top rated school district within the top state for education. We specifically moved to our town for the schools. My children learned Latin and Spanish in elementary school along with English, Math, Science, Social Studies, Music, Art, Gym, Health. Those are the basic subjects taught in US schools. In addition, at home we read to our children daily. Provided them with opportunities for science kits, arts, music classes, scouts, debate and rhetoric. Both of my children are in accelerated classes (one all accelerated including 2x accelerated math, and the other in college classes in high school focused on their areas of interest, but not all accelerated subjects). Your children are their own people. They will have their own interests and desires. I try to keep my kids engaged with their interests. It is not all about me and what I want.

I came up through the public system in the US and it was truly awful in so many ways, but taught me resilience, hunger and ambition like nothing else. Street smarts and survival skills too. Also, gave me great stories to tell private school people later down the road - 'there was that one time there was that giant fight and that kid stabbed the teacher in the head with a pocket knife. And then there was this other fight in the cafeteria...' Perhaps there are other ways to instill this than going to a crappy public school though.\n\n2. Even at our crappy public school, there were some truly great teachers. These teachers are really what you want.\n\nGiven this, I think what we will look for is a place with really passionate teachers, as much individualized attention as possible, room to grow, but will supplement this heavily with an 'outside curriculum' of travel, experiences, camps, etc.\n\nI think there's no way to teach them everything I want them to learn before they leave home, but I will focus on: self-care skills (cooking, health, etc.), character and people skills (preserverance, etc.), finance management, practical skills (gardening, electronics) and anything they are passionate about.

He was always willing and able to use a little magic to make some tasks easier, but Hagrid would be the first to admit that magic was never really in his skillset. His half-giant strength and endurance was probably of far more use to him than his limited magical abilities anyway. We do see him use more advanced spells later on though, so I would assume he at least did some self-teaching or perhaps even a Kwikspell course, but I doubt he had any formal educational ambitions since he already had his dream job as groundskeeper and professor of Care of Magical Creatures.",
                "I don\u2019t think he wasn\u2019t allowed, it\u2019s just he didn\u2019t want to bother. He was in his 60s. I doubt he would enjoy listening to Snape teach with a bunch of 12 year olds.",

Between being groundskeeper, gamekeeper, keeper of keys, and teaching care of magical creatures the next year, he wouldn't have had time to take a full course load. Then, Rita Skeeter outed him as a half giant the year after that, so few people aside from Dumbledore would'nt have employed him anyway. \n\nNot finishing school makes sense, but I don't understand why he didn't try to get a new wand.\n\n(edit: grammar)",

He got a promotion and became a teacher. \n\nHe would have to re-learn all the stuff that students do at the school but they don't need it in adult life. Surely he knew about about Magical Creatures and Herbology but he would have to start from the beginning in subjects like Astronomy, Transfiguration, Potions, the second chosen subjects (muggle studies/runes/divination)\nHe knew something about Charms but he forgot a lot because he illeilgally used only the most needed spells.",
                "Tom Riddle killed Moaning Myrtle, and then tried to pin the crime on Hagrid. Dumbledore tried to argue that Hagrid wasn't responsible for the murder, but at minimum, Hagrid WAS raising a dangerous monster, so Hagrid was expelled, and his wand was broken. Broken wand = no magic (besides wandless magic), so the Ministry was essentially banning Hagrid from doing magic, because he was an accused (not proven) murderer.\n\nDumbledore fixed Hagrid's wand using the Elder Wand, the only wand capable of fixing a broken wand, and hid Hagrid's wand inside an umbrella, because they didn't want the Ministry to know that Dumbledore had restored Hagrid's magical ability, or for them to know that Dumbledore could even do that.\n\nHagrid's accuser becomes known as Lord Voldemort, but the Ministry does not retract their sentence against Hagrid, because bureaucracies are like that. They're extremely slow to correct their wrongdoings, if ever.\n\n50 years later, and the Basilisk is on the loose again, and Hagrid is nearby, so he's wrongly arrested and sent to prison, because the current crime matches his old accusation. The true culprit is revealed and Hagrid is released from prison. But this doesn't exonerate Hagrid from his 50-year-old accusation, even though it obviously does, because bureaucracy. And our heroes don't think it's a battle worth fighting, because Hagrid is living just fine, in spite of the black mark on his record, and his unjust \"ban\" from doing magic (which he's spent 50 years ignoring, because it's toothless). The school expulsion is just... whatever. It's been 50 years, he ain't going back to school. The ban on magic is way worse.\n\nAnd then Hagrid gets promoted from groundskeeper to teacher, almost immediately after exiting prison. That was definitely Dumbledore's doing, but maybe the Ministry had been giving some resistance that relaxed after Hagrid's false arrest/exoneration.",

Of course they're not just going to put him in class with all those children that he's supposed to be an authority figure for. He's still groundskeeper. If they were cool with giving a 13 year old girl a fucking SECRET IMPLEMENT FOR EXPERIMENTAL TIME TRAVEL so she can get MORE CREDITS, then they should have an easy time setting up weekly weekend tutoring sessions for Hagrid after expelling him, rejecting him from wizard society by breaking his wand and making him live in a hut for most of his life, and then literally throwing him in Azkaban for a series of crimes he didn't commit. Give him a new wand for free, offer to upgrade his hut so he has more space, and set up weekend classes for him so he can finally be a full member of society again!! That's the LEAST he should have been offered.

Well, he was wrongfully convicted. You can't deny that. Reparations should be made.\n\n\n He's an adult, ok sure. But there has to be other ways to learn, no one is suggesting he just pick up where he left off and go back to class with teenagers. \n\nHe should've been given the option to continue his education, maybe he chose not to. I don't buy that, but it's possible.\n\nHagrid deserved better. And I never get why people here think that he didn't. It's confusing",

It is stated pretty clearly in the books that wizards did not have to go to Hogwarts and parents could train up their children. So why wouldn\u2019t he be able to study on his own to become a fully qualified wizard even if it wasn\u2019t at Hogwarts?

                "On the one hand: Who\u2019s to say he wasn\u2019t? \n\nHe wouldn\u2019t have been able to finish school traditionally, primarily due to his age. But also because he had his games-keeper duties and most of the professors were his peers, with whom he drunk at the Three Broomsticks.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s not unlikely that Dumbledore (now that Hagrid could get a new wand and likely had permission to be taught from the MoM) wasn\u2019t teaching Hagrid one-on-one. \n\nI choose Dumbledore as he\u2019s the teacher that Hagrid sees most definitively as someone to defer to, and Dumbledore is likely the only teacher who could teach the breadth of the whole curriculum (plus have all the free time, and the most willing, to take on Hagrid).\n\nHowever, Hagrid would only have a few years of education before HBP where his teacher dies and a Wizarding War II ensues. \n\nStarting from second year, when he was expelled, he would have been the equivalent of a fifth year when Dumbledore died and his education paused. \n\nI think he\u2019d more likely be at the level of a third year as was most likely behind in school before expulsion (raising Aragog on the side being one instance of why he\u2019d be distracted) and he definitely forgot most of what he\u2019d previously learnt at Hogwarts anyway. Then when he returns he\u2019s got to teach and be a groundskeeper as well as try and study. On top of that, adults typically have a harder time learning then children do.\n\nEither way, it\u2019s entirely possible he did go back to school and finished two (or four, by my timeline) years after the main book series.\n\nOn the other hand: Why would he?\n\nWe know from Harry and Ron that the Wizarding World doesn\u2019t rigidly need qualifications. Harry and Ron both walk into Auror jobs after proving themselves practically in the real world. Harry eventually becomes Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement despite not completing seventh year. Likewise, Ron offers an alternative route where he becomes a co-owner of a business without a full education. Fred and George do the same thing. According to Pottermore, Neville was also able to become an Auror despite not finishing seventh year.\n\nHagrid may not have formal education but he has 50 years of experience as games-keeper and a few years experience as a teacher at Hogwarts. He was Dumbledore\u2019s (the greatest wizard of the age) right hand man. He would readily be able to get references from the Chief Auror at the Ministry of Magic/ \u2018The Boy Who Lived\u2019 and, if the Cursed Child is to be believed, the Minister for Magic herself, as well as any number of Hogwarts teachers and former students. It\u2019s not unlikely that he could very easily achieve significant career growth. \n \nRegardless, Hagrid is already in his dream job: Care of Magical Creatures Professor & Games-Keeper at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. It\u2019s his home, where he\u2019s lived since he was 11, and where all his friends are. Why would he ever want to leave?\n\nBecause of all this, it seems unlikely that Hagrid would bother with the stress, and rigid learning style and topics of standardised education. Why not do ask some professors to him with, or even do some Kwikspell courses in, areas that interest him rather than bother with the stress of OWLS & NEWTS? After all, the average student only gets between 3 or 7 of each and Hagrid could easily get 2 (Ca",

The MD students are hand picking from very high quality rotations whilst I had to scramble and beg to get an outpatient general family medicine rotation. \n\nJust had to get that out.

Older DO schools are much better positioned for rotations (especially at institutions with residencies), but I've had friends at other schools who only had one or two rotations their entire third year at a place that had residents and were very unprepared for Sub-Is. One of the most important aspects of third year is learning the work flow of the hospital and medical education, not just the medicine itself. When I had sub-I's as a senior resident, I could tell which DOs spent more time in the academic centers and who had been bouncing around from preceptor to preceptor and had no concept of what the job was supposed to look like.  \n\n\nI'm very worried about the new DO schools and the exposure their students are getting.",

My IM rotation was especially bad - only went in for 12 days and only saw a patient or two a day. \n\nWe also arrange all our own 4th year rotations. \n\nMaybe this isn\u2019t true at all DO schools but I think it\u2019s an issue at a significant number.",

My MD friends were always shocked at the amount of applying and begging I had to do to get my aways. I literally could not get a rotation in a specialty I was interested in, and that\u2019s why I did not end up applying for that specialty. And I went to one of the oldest DO schools in the country.\n\nFor me, it worked out. But my biggest piece of advice for DO students: network your ass off early. Like, first year early. We don\u2019t have the connections that most MD schools have, and you are at a disadvantage for the MATCH because of that. It starts with your rotations. Reach out EARLY.

That seems like a fundamental responsibility for a school to have clerkship slots available for both 3rd and 4th year students. \n\nMaybe this should be something harped on more when people ask about applying to DO and MD schools. IF you go to a DO school, then find one where you're guaranteed clerkship slots (ya know, if you pass your tests and actually can start them). AND as an added consideration, how many of those clerkship sites that the school has are at institutions with residency programs?\n\nFor the school I work with, it's at least 11 sites but with another... 2 at least adding residency in the next year. So over half the class will do year 3 and 4 at a residency site (unless they do some away clerkships/ auditions).

But what I find frustrating, and probably this is colored by my experience as an MD/PhD student, is the lack of a deep interest in the pathophysiology of disease. I know that they can understand *what* is going on, but less so *why* something is happening. As a result, I find conversations with them a little tedious, and the DO attendings not particularly helpful when I have nuanced questions about why xyz is happening in a particularly challenging case. I am beginning to see why some academic programs do not tend to take too many DO applicants. Of course\u2014this isn\u2019t a blanket statement.

Homework needs to be better, but going away from it entirely is not prepping anyone for anything. There has to be a balance in between kids having 4 hours of homework a night and kids never being asked anything once they leave school. The middle school in my district stopped giving homework a few years ago, and the direct effect was that even giving students one 30 minute assignment a week was met with significant resistance. \n\n- My district does not have an attendance policy. I've read the justification for this in impoverished districts. I understand it, I understand how this can harm impoverished areas. However, if you do not have any enforcement mechanism for attendance, then many students will know that and just show up as they feel. Then you're dealing with classes where 40% of the class is absent at any given point. It's actively harming everyone.  We shouldn't be teetotalers with it, but there clearly needs to be some means of dealing with students/parents who miss school frequently.\n\n- The no failures policy is asinine and actively dumbing down education. I'm referencing the give 50% instead of 0s as well. Maybe you can justify it on a personal level. It is not justifiable on a school or education wide level. \n\n- In general the US started a re-emphasis of STEM back in the 1990s and early 2000s, and it has not worked. Forcing a student to take Algebra 2 or Geometry or Physics for the third time is a waste of everyone's time and effort. Math - at least for upperclassmen in high school, should be de-emphasized. The risk to reward ratio is crazy for having some goon take Geometry for the 4th time when they can barely handle basic multiplication  and get lost when you ask them something simple like what is 60% of 50?",

As college faculty, I'm only shielded from it by as single degree of abstraction, in that we don't have do deal with parents directly, but I'm going to be dealing with the consequences for perhaps a generation and I have dozens of friends teaching in K-12 and what I hear from them keeps me up at nights. \n\nParents should be raising people to be adults, to be self-sufficient, to endeavor, to challenge, and to be challenged. Instead, many parents are so concerned about future success of their kids that they remove every possible obstacle from their paths even when those obstacles are vitally important to helping those kids learn and grow into a happy, successful person. I feel like overprotection isn't a sufficient descriptor for this new culture of parenting, it's more like the character Christof from the movie *The Truman Show* who is attempting to meticulously construct an idyllic fantasy around his adopted son. \n\nThis problem is exacerbated by some significant percentage of administrators who enable these parents by being more concerned about a school's reputation or lawsuits than actually ensuring they're administering an institution designed to empower students for being adults in the real world, but make no mistake that the inception of this is with many parents. \n\nThe best of who and what I am as an adult is in large part because I was met with challenges as I grew up. Abuse is bad and should be stopped, but not all challenges are abuse. Something as small as figuring out how to walk alone from my house to my elementary school without getting lost or sidetracked was a challenge that yielded empowerment and discipline. Something as small as having a teacher who often screamed at me taught me that sometimes in life I'll deal with people who regulate their emotions differently than I do, and while my mom had my back she also gave me an opportunity to deal with a little verbal abuse and learn to deal with folks like that. When it was necessary and it wasn't appropriate for me to handle something myself, my mom was always there to help, but she also trusted me and understood that I not only could handle some things but *should*.",

                "My biggest unpopular opinion is that schools should (and perhaps need) to be more than just the classroom. Few will argue with that, but the next step is that schools should be open and accessible to students beyond the hours of 7:50-2:30.\n\nWhen I was a kid, it felt like I never left my school - much to the chagrin of my mother. No, I wasn't there early, but it was a rare day when I *wasn't* there until five, six, or later. Oftentimes as part of a sanctioned activity, but just as often it wasn't.\n\nWhen school ended I'd hit the library (the library at my school closes at 2:30, fifteen minutes after last bell...why is it even there?) to \"study\". If it wasn't that, I might be lingering the halls with friends. I might be outside the locker room while a team I wasn't a part of was holding practice. It doesn't matter, once I hit middle school I was always there...this wasn't true for all students but school was never dead.\n\nSchool was a safe place where the unstructured and \"unsupervised\" (quotes because it felt that way, but there was always adults around whether it be lingering teachers, admin, or janitorial staff) time helped me learn lessons about responsibility and helped me find my true self with peers. School - the place, not the classroom - really was instrumental in finding my identity as an adolescent and teen.\n\nNow? Homeroom bell is at 7:50, the door doesn't get unlocked until 7:45. Last bell is at 2:15, students are out the door by 2:25. Forgot your homework, glasses, something else in your locker? Our SRO is right at the front door chasing you away and telling you \"too bad, you'll have to wait until morning.\" Still waiting for your ride at 3:10? I witnessed my principal lecture a 6th grade student that he had to make sure his parents get here earlier \"school isn't a daycare service.\"\n\nHow are kids going to feel welcome in a place when we make sure they know their *un*welcome the second the bell rings?\n\nI sat in a team teacher meeting just after winter break this year where a student disclosed some disturbing behavior (with no shame and a straight face to an entire room of teachers), when she left the classroom one of the teachers said \"It's because these kids have nowhere to go after school.\" I wanted to scream...\"It's here! They should be welcome here!\"\n\nNobody, and I mean nobody shares this opinion. If kids are going to be around then adults have to be and teachers - and I don't blame - don't want to be the ones sitting in their classrooms after the day ends. Administration doesn't want the liability and actively chases kids away - in fact, in my building they chase teachers away at 4:00. \n\nI don't propose to have an answer, but I honestly think that schools should represent safe and open spaces for our students. If we expect them to feel welcome and safe during the school day then they should feel welcome and safe at all times. I truly believe that in the absence of open community centers for school age children - which we don't have - schools should step in to be that space. Whether it's the library, the cafeteria, the gym, the hallways, or courtyard at the front doors we shouldn't be chasing kids away if we want them to feel welcome there.\n\nI also recognize that I'm attempting to mirror my own school experience - but that's because I recognize how invaluable it was for me growing up - and that times have changed since the 1990s.",

                ">People claiming Republicans wish to destroy public education to create an uneducated, easily controlled populace are overshooting the mark.**\n\n\n>Rather, nearly 30 years of teaching has led me to the inescapable conclusion that the real goal is to DISCREDIT public education in an effort to justify voucher programs with the ultimate goal of being able to subsidize their own children's private/exclusive school educations.\n\nI think these are just two results they (Republicans in power) are after; they're not contradictory.\n\nSince they serve the wealthiest 1% of us and not the workers, dismantling public education serves Republicans' need for a segment of the working-class populace willing to vote for them by lessening their ability to think critically and to recognize when they are being lied to and manipulated.\n\nFunneling taxpayer funds meant for public education to charter and religious private schools aids in that dismantling, by reducing funds going to public education and reducing government oversight of education.\n\nIt also aids them by directing that taxpayer money to their wealthy 1% backers. The massive pool of taxpayer cash is the sweetest plum of all grifts in the USA. The \"redistribution of wealth\" that Republicans decry whenever poor people are given aid is in truth a massive flow of cash from the bottom up to the top.\n\nIt also aids them by discounting semi-private and private education to middle-class white, Christian families who cannot afford to pay for it themselves, but who want their kids in the resulting segregated and/or religion-focused (primarily Christian) schools and will vote Republican in return.\n\nSo the results are the working-class and poor aren't educated and can more easily be led to vote Republican against their own interests based on anger and fear rather than logic; the wealthy are allowed to gorge themselves like pigs at the trough of taxpayer cash; and middle-class Christian white folk are convinced to vote Republican because they're able to get their kids out of public schools which are called to serve *everyone* regardless of race, wealth, or religious beliefs and into smaller schools allowed to exclude those different from them; and Republican politicians stay in power and accumulate more wealth.\n\nA couple of other things:\n\nDemocrat politicians' hands are not clean in this. Some are fighting the good fight, but in the 1980s the Democrats began to give up their small, working-class donor base in order to chase the same small pool of massively wealthy ownership-class donors as the GOP, and this accelerated with the ascent of the Clinton [New Democrats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Democrats) (centrists) who have controlled the party since his election in '92. Always remember: A centrist Democrat, *by definition,* agrees with some Republican policies. Since they clearly can't align on social policy, they align on fiscal policy, and the working and poorer classes wind up with little or no representation in government.\n\nThere are other angles the Republicans are working to solve their problem of the majority of Americans not being served by, and thus likely not to vote for, them in a democratic system of government. They work to weaken democracy by attacking people's ability to vote, they attack the power of those votes, and ultimately, they are working to replace democracy with an authoritarian system of government with themselves in charge.\n\nEDIT: My unpopular opinions (depends on who you ask re. their popularity):\n\n* Differentiation is a farce, a tragedy.\n\n* Accommodations and modifications have turned educational standards and requirements measuring achievement into participation trophies. Promotion, graduation, and diplomas are no longer a measure of ability.",

Kids aren\u2019t thinking about how if they ignore all their work for the semester, there\u2019s no way they can pass. They\u2019re just thinking about how it would be so much more comfortable to not do their work in that moment.

My hope is that my husband and I can contribute to all 3 children equally.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Up until higher edution, you won't be conducting new research, you'll be memorizing well known facts.\n\nI do however think that a system that largely judges by memory skills will waste a lot of good potential. There should be room for more i individual adjustment to bring out the best in everybody.\n\nCritical thinking will be a nescessity in higher education, where source reference and source critizism is essential.

It is difficult to discuss the nuances of politics, war, etc if they don't actually know the history of those things. The modern education system in the US isn't good enough for a lot of reasons, but it's not because they 'don't teach critical thinking'. Good example is when my wife and I were renovating our first house last year I had to apply my knowledge of basic mathematics to calculate stuff like square footage of walls/floors to buy the right amounts of paint/stain. Simple stuff of course, but only a trivial problem for most people because they've been educated on how to calculate square footage. You were absolutely taught to critically think because you're doing it right now. You were taught broad concepts and information that now allows you to interact with the world to understand it in nuanced ways.\n\n\nAgain, critical thinking is a byproduct of education not something that can always be directly taught.

That said I don't agree that education (in the UK) fails to teach critical thinking skills. GCSE exam questions are structured to test either: recall (remembering stuff) or application (taking stuff you know about and applying it to a new situation). Application questions being a higher learning skill is more prominent on the higher tier papers, but is still present in foundation papers as well. This is just one example of testing critical thinking in pupils. Modern teaching methods have a far greater emphasis on creating better learners rather than better pupils. In other words teach pupils how to learn, not just facts about countries and stuff.\n\nIn the UK at least it is far from perfect and we can still improve, but suggesting that education is broken suggests that pupils are leaving secondary education unable to enter further education or progress to career based training. The statistics (and the many pupils I have taught) would say that this isn't the case. I will suggest though that the education system can be stifling with its one size fits all approach. Not all pupils can access the syllabus for one reason or another and would benefit greatly from; smaller class sizes, more resources (more teachers and school staff) and a wider range of extra curricular activities as well.

I am one of the first no child left behind generations and it has always been a race to the bottom. \n\n I had 2 amazing teachers one in middle and one in high school who got me out a year early and lead me on the path I am now.

Ex: college physics usually requires at least the first semester of calculus\n\nWhich means students without calculus in high school must wait a semester or two before starting core classes in their majors. \n\nEven if students can take calc and major courses concurrently, they are at a MAJOR disadvantage compared to students who have experience with calculus from high school. \n\n**The \"equitable\" solution would be to improve elementary/middle school math so that EVERY kid takes Algebra I in 8th grade (or sooner), so that EVERY student has a chance at taking Calculus in 12th grade.

Global terrorism still exists, at the cost of thousands of military, and global middle east lives, and we basically handed it right back to the Taliban.\n\nNow I watch and talk to progressives in this state, that have no concept that their current worldview may be flawed, and see they have done nothing but try to make challenging that worldview illegal. They don't even want to have conversations and discuss measurements or initiatives. You talk to them and everything is a psychotic breakdown of logic, to push for \"equality\", and they have no idea how to even go about this, or even measure it, and they have no rational strategy to do it. Question their view? You're a Russian Bot MAGA Trump supporter. Show them facts? They're all false and biased and you should be banned for even discussing them.

Based on over 5000 years of history, and anyone with a family of over 5 people can see the randomness of humanity just means people in that outcomes are just the luck of the draw, and at best you can just provide opportunities for people to get out of their hole.

They have encouraged destruction of cities, pretending history doesn't exist, ignored the learnings of understanding both sides of an discussion, and are now vilifying logic itself. They don't want a debate, a discussion, or a compromise.

In my years as an elder, COBEs typically always use their 'authority' this way. They know what they want to happen, and since they are chairman of the discussion can easily manipulate the rest of the body.\n\nThey equated the family's spirituality to time in the ministry. Regarding them as unspiritual just because they don't pioneer? Terrible. To many elders, publishers are reduced to just numbers and hours on a spreadsheet.\n\nThey used congregation gossip as testimony. 'I've heard some in the congregation say if they wanted advice on family matters, they would go to another elder.' What!? How can this be used in an elder's discussion like this. Elders are supposedly appointed by holy spirt and all are 'qualified' to give advice to the congregation. That's the whole reason they're appointed as elders. Did that elder who mentioned that correct that publisher and guide them to trust the elders? Nope, because he doesn't like this poor elder either, he used that bit of congregation gossip to support removing that poor brother.\n\nTerrible. Terrible video. And the worst thing is all those PIMI elders are just gonna nod their heads in agreement and say what a wonderful video this was.",

                "Wow, this has definitely blown up! That is amazing!\n\nTo address a common concern that I noticed in the comments: the video IS REAL! The issue of higher education has always been a very sensitive topic for me since I came from a very educated background, and it was just a complete absurd for us to not pursue higher education. So, when I saw this video in the now defunct The Warwick PIMO YouTube channel, I downloaded it. When I found out he shut down his channel, I felt compelled to post it here. It seems I did good by doing so.\n\nAlso, there is a TikTok link where this video is now hosted. However, I do not use TikTok, and I seem to have lost this link. If I find it back, I'll surely put it here for you guys.\n\nNow, on a personal note: the very ignorant view that uneducated Jehovah's Witnesses have on higher education was probably the major factor that pushed me into questioning - and starting to actually disdain - the cult.

JW cult has (maybe?) a billion dollars, Mormon cult has 100's of billions.  Why?  Because of higher education.\n\nImagine if the JW's had built a university in New York just like the Mormons built their own university, they would be so much richer.  Instead of window washing and low paying jobs, JW's would have corporations with other JW's working the high paying jobs.  This creates more donations.

Why do we hear about the risks of wisdom teeth removal and appendectomy\u2019s than we do child birth. We really need to stop glorifying birth because not all women have good experiences and most of the time child birth is traumatic.",

Like down in the same areas as some countries we'd consider third world\n\nBut this is also an accountability issue. It's easy to blame everyone else for what was \"never explained\" to that woman but we have literal supercomputers in our hands and information is mostly free and easy to find. 10 seconds googling \"pregnancy risks\" and she would've learned a helluva lot about the risks.",

It was more just \"oh your belly will look a bit different\". \n\nI ending up learning more about the horrors of it from tiktok, reddit, and my job. The resources are out there, yes.

And among those who are *not* ignorant about the risks of pregnancy (because a complication happened to them, they witnessed someone else have a complication, ect), these facts are *extremely, extremely, extremely* downplayed. And in the rare moments where they *aren't* downplayed, it's easy to interpret \"rare\" as *it couldn't, shouldn't, possibly wouldn't happen to me.* \n\nThis is normal among all types of women in my cohort. Both those who've gone on to get PhDs, and those who are in tight-knit religious communities alike. Who *actively* used the internet to learn about their pregnancies, who'd watch educational YouTube videos about what happens during each week in development. Discussing their pregnancies with their families/friends who are also mothers/mothering circles online. The occasional brief mention of miscarriages (or multiple), a laugh and a shrug, *\"it was tough, but we kept on carrying on and baby so-and-so eventually came to us.\"* Stories of difficult childbirths and horrors, but with a smile and a grateful remark how it was \"worth it\" for the sake of baby so-and-so. A collective amnesia. \n\nIt's hard to internalize risk as *risk that this could happen to me and me specifically.* Pre-eclampsia is often described as a \"rare pregnancy complication,\" but \"rare\" is [5-8%](https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/preeclampsia/#frequency) of pregnancies in the US. There's a general known risk that a newborn may go to the NICU, but that's still about [10-15%](https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapediatrics.2015.1305) of babies born in the US. Internet information about pregnancy risks truly are a Google search away. But even with that search, even in the information age, the information and statistics that are reported sound so minuscule and *abstract* that the statistical reality of childbirth/pregnancy complications never truly sink in. \n\nWith the virulent romanticism of pregnancy, childbirth, and motherhood screaming behind all of the above, it's easy to see how someone could still come out shocked. And I do feel for OP-- after all, they're currently in the midst of what seems to be a very scary ordeal with their child in the NICU (or so what I could gather from their comments). Emotions are rightfully quite high. I only wish the best for OP and their child in surviving their postnatal difficulties. \n\nPlease give OP kindness.",

By describing women like this you just make us seem weak, controllable and unable to figure shit our ourselves. There are plenty of resources out there. Some people just are not resourceful and some people have less than average intelligence. Most woman in countries like the US are making these decisions to have children themselves. Tons of women WANT children. Plenty of women who don't want children, but get pregnant, have the opportunity to have to aborted. These are choices people make and it is easier to blame anyone but themselves when it backfires. There are real instances of abuse and control but this is not the majority of women.",

I felt horrible for her\n\nWe can all act like we're all super educated and aware of the risks but truth is: people lie to you so you'll have kids and they think they're \"helping you\"\n\nHow many parents and relatives have told you things like: it didn't hurt that much, we'll all be there to support you, modern medicine has eliminated painful births, it's only a few minutes, they can tell birth defects in advance now?\nOr, if you push back ever so slightly, will start guilting you: how is it fair to your husband and to your parents? All your ancestors did it, are you less than them? Etc.\n\nHow many times have family and friends pushed someone through with carrying to term, promised to be there to support and when the time came told the person \"it's YOUR baby, handle it\"? How many times has the person realised they never wanted the baby, that they were pressured into it and repressed it for either the baby's sake or their own? What kind of mental health toll does that have on you?\n\nSo yeah, I can see why someone would be unaware of ALL the risks and only tangentially aware and go through with it, because if we told everyone how they're socially expected to be willing to die giving birth, to carry to term unviable or severely deformed fetuses and how no matter what the end result is, how they're expected to assume the role of primary caretaker in a way that eclipses the rest of their entire life - would they still go through with it?\n\nIt's partly why I'm childfree even though I can't be impregnated, I don't want to ruin someone's life like that, it's abominable to force something like this upon anyone even the slightest bit ignorant on all the ramifications of pregnancy and I long for the days where comprehensive reproductive education including all risks, is standard for all people regardless of their background\n\nAny religion, social rule, government, etc. that helps obfuscate the harsher truths of childbirth is complacent with these deaths, trauma and depression",

                ">The complaint was filed July 3 on behalf of Black and Latino community groups in New England. The group argued that students with legacy ties are up to seven times more likely to be admitted to Harvard, can make up nearly a third of a class and that about 70% are white. For the Class of 2019, about 28% of the class were legacies with a parent or other relative who went to Harvard.\n\nIt's been said that it's [harder to get a job at Walmart than to get into Harvard](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/03/28/wal-mart-has-a-lower-acceptance-rate-than-harvard/). But while that may be technically correct it's likely because the \"wrong\" people don't bother even applying to Harvard because they've know about legacy admissions. Potential Harvard applicants probably already self-select themselves out of applying after being told that \"it's who you know\".

One of the few things of value that the university can offer to alumni after they graduate is the prospect of admitting their children- they don\u2019t have too many other options to entice them to stay in touch with the university.\n\nThe people who really get screwed by the current system are those students who aren\u2019t in the 1% but aren\u2019t at the bottom half of the socioeconomic ladder either. If you\u2019re in the top 20%, you\u2019ve got a worse chance of getting into Harvard or other elite universities than anyone else with all other things being equal. \n\nThe most fair way to do admissions would be to establish some minimum requirements that are clear for everyone to see and select students from a pool of applicants who meet those requirements by random lottery.",

                "Sad.\n\nI dunno how standardized AP classes are in what they teach. But I partially fell in love with the field because of the fascinating and vivid tales of experiments I learned in that class my junior year. Pavlov's dog, the Stanford prison experiment, Asch's conformity experiment, and Milgram's shocking people. \n\nThey were weird, wild and amazingly interesting. Sure most, if not all would not stand up to modern rigors/ethics we have today, but they are good stories nonetheless. I think a lot of psychology can be pretty boring, and I certainly think it's a difficult subject to teach teenagers given how multidemnsional and theoretical it is. \n\nAs a therapist. I think we're at an age where mental health is both used by a capitalistic system to keep people afloat in a world that increasingly sucks for them, but also helps people come to terms with their existence, and see how they can live their life in a more meaningful way, and make an impact for good. Maybe this will have no impact on that, but it's sad to me that kids won't get exposure to that sort of thing in florida, especially with such a high latin american/carribean population which obviously we could use more of in the field. \n\nThe brain drain continues in the south.",

We simply had different life experiences and values and so I decided that I wouldn\u2019t date anyone without at least a college degree. Also, I don\u2019t want to be broke lol, and of course, there are plenty of people without degrees who aren\u2019t broke and even doing better financially then people with multiple degrees.

If he's not studying a trade where he can get a steady union job with a living wage or isn't lucky enough to own a business that remains successful for more than 2 years (which is when most small businesses fail), then how is he supporting himself and aiding the relationship? Of course, for women who are making bank and are happy and able to support a house husband or stay-at-home-dad partner that's not a concern. But the vast majority of us will need 2 income earners in the relationship to remain stable at baseline, let alone to have a comfortable work life, vacations, and retirement. I personally want the DINK life. I've curated my studies and job trajectories based off of the potential salaries I could be making in the first 3 years. When I get to that point my future partner will need to either be in the same ballpark or working hard/strategically to get there.

I don't want kids, but for the people who do, it also has a huge impact on what kind of life they can give them. I think other things go into it too, like level of financial literacy, debt, assets, etc, but money matters. It's the number one reason for divorce. I've also seen some studies that found that domestic abuse and cheating is higher in couples where women make more than their male partners (I'll link them as a reply).\n\nI don't place as much weight on education as income/assets, but it does feel hard to find Black men who are my financial equals or betters. It was way easier when I made less, but it's challenging in my current income bracket. I wouldn't change it for anything, but most men I meet who are in a similar bracket are already taken and the number of Black men is pretty small. The good thing is that the Black men I do meet seem more likely to be single than other men, so it's not a total crapshoot. I definitely have to be strategic about meeting people, though.",

I think it's moreso because they want a guy with advanced education that looks like a professional athlete and has a great personality.

I was depressed.   \nDuring the mean time got divorced, met a blue collar worker, had a baby, and he supported me emotionally, physically, and gave me more love and kindness than the Ivy League bro could have ever given me, during my most depressed times. Even when I wasn\u2019t working, he cooks, cleans, does my nails and hair, and just shows his appreciation every day. I stayed home with the baby and he got me a new laptop so I could study to become an engineer. And yes I make more now, but we hold each other down, and our money is each others.    \nI  think that values matter, love, kindness, support, loyalty, spiritual uplift, joy, and tenderness - even the ability to listen and apologize. That\u2019s my list. And considering $ and situations change, and education can\u2019t prevent everything or guarantee anything, those things will never be.",

Men who think these things are superficial feel that way because it\u2019s superficial to *them*, and *they* are superficial. To superficial people, education and jobs are just a box to tick. They see it as no different than preferring someone likes the same music as them. They can\u2019t understand why an educated, gainfully employed woman would want a man with a job other than to \u201ctake his money to spend on material things,\u201d because they probably don\u2019t think about maintaining a household or financially preparing for the future themselves. \n\nThe other clapback to this is \u201cjust because someone didn\u2019t go to college doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t smart.\u201d Yet I\u2019ve actually never seen anyone say \u201cI only want to date someone who\u2019s been to college because they\u2019re the only smart ones.\u201d Higher education is a reflection of values, a reflection of opportunities, and a reflection of commitment.

And frankly\u2026.I\u2019ve dated enough \u201cvalidate me, I\u2019m smart even though I\u2019ve never gone to college\u201d guys. I\u2019d rather date a dumb person who went, to be entirely honest, because there is no group of people with a bigger chip on their shoulder than a self described smart man with a high school education facing down a woman of any level of intelligence with a college education. You won\u2019t even mention that shit and they\u2019ll start moaning \u201cohhhhh college girl, you think you\u2019re better than me\u201d because you shared a fun fact you heard on TV or something.

                "I\u2019m married but when I was dating I feel like I tried to have an open mind and dated guys from different backgrounds. But ultimately, I\u2019m a physician and I\u2019m married to a physician and I think I prefer this even though I didn\u2019t necessarily go looking for it lol. I met my husband when we were both in between undergrad and medical school, studying for the MCAT, working in science related jobs. Before meeting him, I dated all kinds of guys-professionals with college or graduate degrees, blue collar tradesmen or high school graduates. Ultimately, I was looking for a guy with similar values that I could laugh with who had some level of intellectual curiosity whether it manifested through hobbies or career, it didn\u2019t mean he had to have a bunch of formal education. I will say, I did tend to have more in common and hit it off easier with people who had more education vs blue collar guys. Obviously my husband is overall a better match because of values, personality and the way we \u201cfit\u201d together (not because of his profession or degrees) and those other guys weren\u2019t because we didn\u2019t work for whatever reason (not ever because of an education gap). But I think I have come to really appreciate that my husband and I are in the same field because medicine is such a weird world to be a part of and it\u2019s really nice when your spouse totally gets that (crazy patients, crazy colleagues, crazy hours, etc). Which is why a lot of physicians are married to other physicians or other types of medical professionals. That and we spend so much time in training and working we just end up marrying one another lol. I\u2019m sure if my husband were a teacher or accountant or some other professional vocation we\u2019d be fine, probably would be better, we\u2019d have a lot less \u201cshop talk\u201d at home in our off time lol. I have to admit, I don\u2019t necessarily think that I would be super compatible with an average blue collar worker at this point but I could be wrong.\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s superficial to want to date someone with a degree, i think you understand at this point what kind of person you will be most compatible with and if that person is someone with a degree it\u2019s your prerogative. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re saying that person must be 6\u20192\u201d and above with chiseled abs (though I won\u2019t fault you for that either lol but that is certainly superficial), getting through college and advanced degrees is pretty suggestive of a level of intellectual curiosity, drive and overall compatibility that matters when thinking about characteristics in a potential partner.

This basically proves that such teaching is not necessary.\n\nThe Western world doesn't need the current fixation on gender ideology to overcome intolerance for people with varying gender identities. We can simply push tolerance and acceptance on a more broad basis without all this fixation on gender. \n\nIn closing, I think gender ideology has either the intended or unintended consequence of getting kids to adopt gender as a compelling lens through which to view the world. I personally do not view the world, or myself, through such a lens. Never. It's unfair to instill that in kids before they are old enough to choose to explore it on their own.

I'm just gonna drop this here for anyone to figure out what to do with it.\n\n------\n\n>**Stalin** : Do you deny the role of the intelligentsia in revolutionary movements? Was the Great French Revolution a lawyers' revolution and not a popular revolution, which achieved victory by rousing vast masses of the people against feudalism and championed the interests of the Third Estate? And did the lawyers among the leaders of the Great French Revolution act in accordance with the laws of the old order? Did they not introduce new, bourgeois revolutionary laws?\n>\n>The rich experience of history teaches that up to now not a single class has voluntarily made way for another class. There is no such precedent in world history. The Communists have learned this lesson of history. Communists would welcome the voluntary departure of the bourgeoisie. But such a turn of affairs is improbable; that is what experience teaches. That is why the Communists want to be prepared for the worst and call upon the working class to be vigilant, to be prepared for battle. Who wants a captain who lulls the vigilance of his army, a captain who does not understand that the enemy will not surrender, that he must be crushed? To be such a captain means deceiving, betraying the working class. That is why I think that what seems to you to be old-fashioned is in fact a measure of revolutionary expediency for the working class.\n>\n>**Wells** : I do not deny that force has to be used, but I think the forms of the struggle should fit as closely as possible to the opportunities presented by the existing laws, which must be defended against reactionary attacks. There is no need to disorganise the old system because it is disorganising itself enough as it is. That is why it seems to me insurrection against the old order, against the law, is obsolete; old-fashioned. Incidentally, I deliberately exaggerate in order to bring the truth out more clearly. I can formulate my point of view in the following way :\n>\n>first, I am for order; second, I attack the present system in so far as it cannot assure order; third, I think that class war propaganda may detach from socialism just those educated people whom socialism needs.\n>\n>**Stalin** : In order to achieve a great object, an important social object, there must be a main force, a bulwark, a revolutionary class. Next it is necessary to organise the assistance of an auxiliary force for this main force; in this case this auxiliary force is the Party, to which the best forces of the intelligentsia belong. Just now you spoke about \"educated people.\" But what educated people did you have in mind? Were there not plenty of educated people on the side of the old order in England in the seventeenth century, in France at the end of the eighteenth century, and in Russia in the epoch of the October Revolution? The old order had in its service many highly educated people who defended the old order, who opposed the new order. Education is a weapon the effect of which is determined by the hands which wield it, by who is to be struck down.\n>\n>Of course, the proletariat, socialism, needs highly educated people. Clearly, simpletons cannot help the proletariat to fight for socialism, to build a new society. I do not underestimate the role of the intelligentsia; on the contrary, I emphasize it. The question is, however, which intelligentsia are we discussing?\n>\n>Because there are different kinds of intelligentsia.\n>\n>**Wells** : There can be no revolution without a radical change in the educational system. It is sufficient to quote two examples: The example of the German Republic, which did not touch the old educational system, and therefore never became a republic; and the example of the British Labour Party, which lacks the determination to insist on a radical change in the educational system.\n>\n>**Stalin** : That is a correct observation.\n>\n>Permit me now to reply to your three points.\n>\n>First, the main thing for the revolution is the existence of a social bulwark. This bulwark of the revolution is the working class.\n>\n>Second, an auxiliary force is required, that which the Communists call a Party. To the Party belong the intelligent workers and those elements of the technical intelligentsia which are closely connected with the working class. The intelligentsia can be strong only if it combines with the working class.\n>\n>If it opposes the working class it becomes a cipher.\n>\n>Third, political power is required as a lever for change. The new political power creates the new laws, the new order, which is revolutionary order.\n>\n>I do not stand for any kind of order. I stand for order that corresponds to the interests of the working class. If, however, any of the laws of the old order can be utilised in the interests of the struggle for the new order, the old laws should be utilised.\n>\n>I cannot object to your postulate that the present system should be attacked in so far as it does not ensure the necessary order for the people.\n>\n>And, finally, you are wrong if you think that the Communists are enamoured of violence. They would be very pleased to drop violent methods if the ruling class agreed to give way to the working class. But the experience of history speaks against such an assumption.",

            "title": "It\u2019s official: Student loan payments will restart in October, Education Department says",
            "selftext": "[https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/20/its-official-student-loan-payments-will-restart-in-october.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/20/its-official-student-loan-payments-will-restart-in-october.html)\n\nOver the three-year-long pause on student loan payments, the U.S. Department of Education has repeatedly told borrowers their bills were set to resume, only to take it back and provide them more time.This time, however, the agency really means it.The Education Department posted on its website that \u201cpayments will be due starting in October,\u201d and a recent law passed by Congress will make changing that plan difficult. It will likely be a big adjustment for borrowers when the pandemic-era policy expires. Around 40 million Americans have debt from their education. The typical monthly bill is roughly $350.\u201cFor many borrowers, the payment pause has been life altering \u2014 saving many from financial ruin and allowing others to finally get ahead financially,\u201d said Persis Yu, deputy executive director at the Student Borrower Protection Center. Here\u2019s what to know.\n\n3-year pause saved the average borrower $15,000 \n\nFormer President Donald Trump first announced the stay on federal student loan bills and the accrual of interest in March 2020, when the coronavirus pandemic hit the U.S. and crippled the economy. The pause has since been extended eight times. Nearly all people eligible for the relief have taken advantage of it, with less than 1% of qualifying borrowers continuing to make payments on their education debt, according to an analysis by higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz.\n\nAs a result of the policy, the average borrower likely saved around $15,000 in student loan payments, Kantrowitz said. Why the pause will end in the fall The Education Department notes on its financial aid website that \u201cCongress recently passed a law preventing further extensions of the payment pause.\u201d It is referring to the agreement reached between Republicans and Democrats to raise the nation\u2019s debt ceiling, which President Joe Biden signed into law in early June. In exchange for voting to increase the borrowing limit, Republicans demanded large cuts to federal spending. They sought to repeal Biden\u2019s executive action granting student loan forgiveness, but the Biden administration refused to agree to that. However, included in the deal was a provision that officially terminates the pause at the end of August.\n\nEven before that agreement, the Biden administration had been preparing borrowers for their payments to resume by September. \u201cThe emergency period is over, and we\u2019re preparing our borrowers to restart,\u201d Education Secretary Miguel Cardona recently said at a Senate hearing.Interest will pick up in September, payments in October The Education Department says borrowers will be expected to make their first post-pause payment in October. Meanwhile, interest will start accumulating on borrowers\u2019 debt again on Sept. 1, the department says.Exact due dates will vary based on your account details, Kantrowitz said.\u201cYour due date will be at least 21 days after you\u2019re sent a loan statement,\u201d he said. Borrowers don\u2019t know what they\u2019ll owe As the Biden administration tries to ready millions of Americans to restart their student loan payments, there\u2019s one big open question that may make that preparation difficult: Most borrowers don\u2019t know what they\u2019ll owe in the fall.That\u2019s because the Supreme Court has yet to issue a verdict on the validity of Biden\u2019s plan to cancel up to $20,000 in student debt for borrowers. A decision is expected this month. Around 37 million people would be eligible for some loan cancellation, Kantrowitz estimated.\n\nRoughly a third of those with federal student loans, or 14 million people, would have their balances entirely forgiven by the president\u2019s program, according to an estimate by Kantrowitz. As a result, these borrowers won\u2019t owe anything come October. For those who still have a balance after the relief, the Education Department has said it plans to \u201cre-amortize\u201d borrowers\u2019 lower debts. That\u2019s a wonky term that means it will recalculate people\u2019s monthly payment based on their lower tab and the number of months they have left on their repayment timeline.Kantrowitz provided an example: Let\u2019s say a person currently owes $30,000 in student loans at a 5% interest rate. Before the pandemic, they would have paid around $320 a month on a 10-year repayment term. If forgiveness goes through and that person gets $10,000 in relief, their total balance would be reduced by a third, and their monthly payment will drop by a third, to roughly $210 a month.\n\nEducation Department Undersecretary James Kvaal recently warned that if the administration is unable to deliver on Biden\u2019s loan forgiveness, delinquency and default rates could skyrocket. The borrowers most in jeopardy of defaulting are those for whom Biden\u2019s policy would have wiped out their balance entirely, Kvaal said. \u201cUnless the Department is allowed to provide one-time student loan debt relief,\u201d Kvaal said, \u201cwe expect this group of borrowers to have higher loan default rates due to the ongoing confusion about what they owe.\u201d",

We had one of the standard textbooks, were free to ask any question we wanted either out loud or anonymously by writing it down. It was treated very seriously and done very well. After the general biological portion boys and girls were separated and a male teacher sat us all down and spoke very frankly to us about the topic and treated us with respect. I assume the same was true for the girls as they went off with a female teacher who was, at the time, pregnant (incidentally). It was a wholesome and positive experience that communicated all the important information in a totally non-biased, non-religious way (as in there wasn\u2019t a single mention of the Bible or religion whatsoever). I learned everything I needed to know about the biology of human sexuality and also the responsibility required if one chose to engage in it (ie how to do it safely).

Instead, they have an extra hole. The boy puts his part into the girl part and shoots something called sperm which makes her pregnant. \n\nI was left with 10,000 questions, but given how awkward he seemed talking about it and how he didn't even tell me what words to use to describe the \"parts\" I figured I wouldn't ask and ended up googling whatever I wanted to know because I knew about incognito mode and deleting broswer history and my parents didn't. \n\nSo I googled what lady parts are called and finally found out it's called a vagina, which I thought was pronounced vah gin uh (with the G making the G sound not the J sound). That misunderstanding carried with me until a year or two later when I was talking to one of my brothers about it, and he corrected me.\n\nI had also never even heard the word penis uttered despite being the owner of one until I was 14. My oldest brother had a 4 year old at that point and he came to visit, when he was laying on the couch, his son climbed up on the arm of the couch and jumped on him, landing right on his crotch. As he winced in pain he explained to his *4 year old son* that you need to be careful around the crotch because that's where your penis is and it hurts a lot if it gets hit. I'd been wondering what the proper word for my man parts are but I dared not ask and never tried to look it up, so when I heard the word penis I made a note to google it later and finally, at 14 fucking years old, I learned the proper term for my genetalia. \n\nI didn't know what people did when having sex or even that women had periods or anything like that. I remember seeing an ad for womens pads while watching TV with my mom and older sister and when I asked why women needed avsorbent pads in their underwear I just got a *look* from both of them and nothing was explained to me. \n\nI was incredibly freaked out when one day my sister used the toilet and I was waiting for her to be done, when I went in there she had forgotten to flush and there was a bunch of blood in there with her defacation. \nI worriedly told my older brothers and they looked at each other, said \"she must be hitting that time\" and told me not to worry about it and just flush the toilet. \n\nI ended up being so curious about it all that I started looking up porn when I was 15 so that I could understand what sex even was. \n\nI was never told what masturbating is, so I ended up just kinda figuring that out on my own. I felt shamed for doing it, even all the way into my 20s, but it wasn't uncommon for me to be left home alone, so I found plenty of opportunity. \n\nIt was easy for me to be ignorant of sex though, because I've never cared for it. When I was 21 and living on my own I finally started looking into sexualities and realized I'm asexual.

But yeah we had normal sex ed, learned about periods and ovulation, and got a refresher in biology class as well, and the health class teacher even taught us and showed diagrams about the vulva and the function of the clit.

He was aghast at the total lack of sex education outside of \"don't have sex\". He brought in an expert that specializes in youth sex education that gave the entire school a 3-hour lecture on the topic. Honestly, it was pretty great and explained just about everything from the actual biological mechanics, to the social aspects, to consent.\n\nThen a few months later, someone got pregnant and the principle didn't expel them (which was done in previous administrations).\n\nThe school board fired the principle because they reasoned the sex-ed had led to the pregnancy and the principal's refusal to expel the student was \"supporting premarital sex\"...",
                "For context: I went to a christian homeschooling program that was basically a regular Christian school but worse and more unregulated since it was technically listed as homeschooling. The only time sex was ever mentioned was when the one kid who they would let plan and give sermons (he's a youth pastor now, former theatre kid, haven't talked to him in a while so I hope he's doing okay because he was pretty nice) talked about sex and how we should abstain from sex until marriage, normal evangelical shit, and the assistant to the head teacher at the time was fucking livid and shut it down when the word sex was mentioned. Funny how it works that when someone mentions sex, even when it agrees with them, they get really mad... It was a whole debacle. He ended up being allowed to give his sermon when the head teacher got involved. \n\nHowever, I might add that in public middle school, it was ironically so much fucking worse. Again, for more context, I live in Mississippi and this was about 7 years ago. We were actively taught by teachers to abstain from sex until marriage. It is literally illegal, both now and then, for Mississippi teachers to teach their students how to use a condom. The only time condoms were even mentioned was to say they'll probably break so you shouldnt have sex... (cant see how that might backfire at all.) The vast majority of the curriculum was just dedicated to showing us pictures of what STDs look like and how horrible they are, and telling us the only way to avoid it is to, you guessed it, abstain from sex until marriage. Jesus Christ, no wonder we had the highest teen pregnancy rate in the country at the time. (Just checked the most recent statistics I could find, and that honor now goes to Arkansas, but we're still #2). No mention of gay or trans people at all either, so I kept feeling like I was about to phase out of existence when the curriculum assumed I would one day be a woman with a husband one day. Fuck Mississippi's sex education. It's just Christian nonsense masquerading as health advice. It literally pisses me off to this day and I'm a grown adult now.",

                "Low quality education and the issue with our power grid has already been articulated by JICA in the 1990s. Post-EDSA revolution there was a lot of feasibility studies that JICA would like to undertake and propose with the PH government. The problem is, JICA would like to work with educated Filipinos rather than having their engineers, architects and other professionals to come to the Philippines. However, that is the time the quality of our education became so obvious. So, many Filipinos got grants at this time. But, and a big BUT, most of them did not return or stayed in the Philippines. This is because the trend of becoming an OFW started and is much better. There are no financial insentive for these people to stay and apply what they've learned. Then, for investors, hiring locals who doesn't even have the level of education comparable to their country makes them think twice and eventually not pursue the investment. Our education system is so behind and it is a genuine concern for most of our partner countries.\n\nOn the power grid, there have been several attempts to have all these joint exploration with various countries. But, again, corruption.\n\nBasically, what he is saying in this interview are the factors that make investors halt or not proceed in establishing businesses here in the Philippines. Plus, most pledge \"investments\" when a Philippine president visits should not be taken seriously. 90%+ of those do not materialize because of our issues on education and power supply. Those are just courtesy pledges and most do not survive feasibility stage.\n\nAnd even if its not foreign investors, home grown and local investors are having a hard time because of those factors mentioned above.

But based on little things she said to the two of us, I knew that Mrs Turner resented the crap out of us taking away what was \"supposed\" to be free time for her. Teachers and school counselors that have to deal with the \"imposition\" of accommodating parents that don't just go along with this crap being the status quo will often take that resentment out on the kids. I'm not saying they are bad people, they're just human.

Even when I was in school teachers had to restrict the amount of paper used because there wasn't enough. And usually teachers had to buy supplies with their own paychecks.

While we know Natsuki's father is strict even normally, it is possible that he doesn't turn abusive until Monika intervenes to make him so. Conversely, it is possible that Monika might have actually messed with Natsuki's life very little -perhaps only removing her ability to hide what's happening to her- and the abuse was always there to begin with.",
                "You don't need to have your skin tight to your bones to be malnourished. Malnourished just means badly fed, this includes ppl just missing enough salt and sugar in their diet to those who are obese. Considering she is pretty much said to be so small due to poor nutrition, I'd say yes. Especially in act two where she starts passing down from lack of energy",
                "Okay, quick anatomy lesson time. There isn't just bone and fat in the body. There's multiple layers of skin, muscle, tissues, and vessels. There is a LOT needed for someone to look like \"her bones are showing\". That's very very very serious malnutrition to the point where your body EATS your own muscles and tissues to live on and there's no extra fat to provide nutrition or energy to the body. But malnutrition is malnutrition, even if it's not as serious as that. Negligence and not having enough daily calories, proteins and other nutrients stunts height, body weight, size, and a whole lot of stuff. If she was down to the bone, it'd be a lot more obvious she was being abused and it'll show in her face. So no, just because she has thighs does not mean she isn't  suffering from malnutrition.",

And Monika did keep protein bars SPECIFICALLY for Natsuki before her epiphany fucked her up.\n\nSo there was definitely a level of abuse, or if not, then a level of destitution in Natsuki's family.\n\nIn short, death of the author. If you want Natsuki to have a happier home life and Monika just fucked it up, go for it.\n\nIf you want Natsuki's dad to basically be a piece of shit, go for it.\n\nIt's up to you.",
                "She looks really compact and fragile. This is exactly the kind of body type you'd expect to see from someone that has one to two meals a day and not enough raw calories, source being I have this body type and lived like that due to similar circumstances. It doesn't really have a bearing on height until it's to the point where you are emaciated, but it does make your body be built a lot weaker if it's during development in places like bones and muscles. It's caused a lot of problems for me but it does get better with better eating habits. It's a very unseen kind of neglect, which means people get away with it and suffer from it way more often than you'd think.",
                "We don't see her topless so we don't know if her ribs show",
                "Well in act 1 we only get to hear natsuki say her dad is strict but she doesnt really say if he is abusive. Then again, act 1 natsuki could be lying so the mc won\u2019t feel bad for her. Its kinda a grey area",
                "Yes, you can be malnourished without your body looking extremely skinny",
                "Yes. There's plenty of evidence of her being malnourished. I'll list them out here as someone who studied anatomy and psychology both. \n\nThe first telling sign is her very small stature and her very low weight. She's clearly very small for her age compared to the other girls. Her and Sayori are the same age and in the same grade (first or second year, I can't remember for sure). We can also tell how skinny she is my looking at her thighs. Yes, genetics can cause someone to be short but that's probably not the case here.\n\nIn Act 1, she states that her dad is \"strict\" (abusive, this is confirmed when she said \"my dad would beat the sh*t out of me\" and her \"Things I Like about Papa\" poem) so its likely that she's being starved or neglected. He doesn't give her money for food either, she has to scavenge for coins in vending machines. Abuse victims tend to downplay what their abuser is doing to them. \n\nIn Act 2 (if you choose her route. You can't see this during Yuri's route), she'll randomly pass out on MC's shoulder while the are reading manga but then she's completely fine again after Monika gives her food. Malnutrition can cause dizzy spells and even fainting so that adds up as well. \n\nAbout your \"but her bones aren't showing\" statement, bones don't have to be showing for someone to be considered malnourished. The term you're looking for is \"emaciated\". Emaciated and malnourished are completely different things. Anyone, no matter what their size is, can be malnourished. Only people who have prominent bones are emaciated. You'd have to be extremely malnourished before your body starts to eat your muscles. \n\nNatsuki could possibly have an eating disorder but, based on the information we're given in the game, it's not likely that she does. She does want to eat and she doesn't avoid it, but she can't.",

In Act 2, she's not getting to eat because she doesn't even have money to buy anything herself. In Act 1, she's making and buying things for others to eat all the time.",

It's hinted that she doesn't eat much at home during her time with the player, but it's not enough to confirm if it's actually malnourishment or if she follows a strict diet. Now, in act 2, it's a little more noticeable when the player hangs out with Natsuki. When she glitches out a little bit and Monika gives her a snack, it's hinted to a little more than in act 1.",

Before the Pandemic, Ford was trying to legislate \"on line learning\" in Ontario High Schools. He was trying to introduce a scenario where students must complete several course credits \"on line\" in order to graduate. Would this help students? Perhaps, but would it eliminate teachers and the wages and benefits they collect? Definitely. When everyone was forced to endure \"on line learning\" during the Pandemic we all saw what a HUGE Disaster it was. Right now Ford is trying to figure out how to implement Private \"For Profit\" Education. Hmmm that might take a while. I suspect we will see Huge Tax Breaks for Charter Schools which cater to students special interests, sports, computers, science, engineering etc.  Of course parents will also have to pay tuition for their children to attend and teacher salaries and benefits will be slashed.\n\nFor the past several months ETFO (Elementary Teachers Federation of Ontario) have been running advertisements describing the ongoing and upcoming cuts to the Ontario Education Budget and the effect it will have on our children. But for the past two months I've heard radio announcements, paid for by the Government of Ontario, describing the wonderful work our Provincial Government has done this past year in Education.

Most of my work includes dealing with management stuff and collaborating with third parties/consultants who are actually doing the SOC work. \n\nAll my cyber security knowledge comes from Comptia courses at udemy. I don't have certs as there is always lack of funding for such things at my work. I have read it is very difficult to just move to a better job by just online courses but I don't really know from where to start. I do have some knowledge but not nearly enough to justify 5 years of experience. I know I wasted a lot of my time at this place and should've moved somewhere long back, however this stagnation at my current job is taking a toll on my mental health and I am losing my confidence.

This manifests in a variety of ways, but the most notable is probably accumulating [relevant industry-recognized certifications](https://bytebreach.com/which-certifications-should-you-go-for/). (see links 5, 7, and 8) \n\n## On Job Hunting\n\nLooking for work [can be a really stressful endeavor for folks](https://old.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/15k4qzt/mentorship_monday_post_all_career_education_and/jvgc311/), especially if you are changing careers, working internationally, or in the midst of an economic downturn. To that end, I would direct you to some of the following resources for consideration to better optimize your labor:\n\n1. [This generic resume template](https://www.overleaf.com/project/644db685122e9d9110981f9a)\n2. [This blog post on resume formatting considerations](https://bytebreach.com/how-to-write-an-infosec-resume/)\n3. [This resource on structuring/organizing your job hunting efforts](https://bytebreach.com/the-job-hunt-cybersecurity-work-and-how-to-find-it/)\n4. [These projects for bolstering your resume](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/sxir9c/as_a_entry_level_professional_trying_to_get_into/hxsm5qn/)\n\nAdditionally, you might consider looking at the following jobs listings platforms:\n\n* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/) (see example considerations for your LinkedIn profile [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/140vcnf/comment/jnf8imi/?context=3) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/11w27ey/comment/jd8nwvh/?context=3))\n* [usajobs.gov](https://www.usajobs.gov/) (for U.S. federal work, including 3-letter agencies; note that they have a *strict* [resume format](https://www.sec.gov/jobs/sample-resume/sample-resume.pdf) you need to adopt)\n* [clearancejobs](https://www.clearancejobs.com/) (for those in possession of an active U.S. gov't clearance)\n* [Handshake](https://joinhandshake.com/) (a platform exclusively geared towards students seeking internships and new graduates)\n\nIn broad terms, your employability is helped by cultivating both breadth in domain familiarity and depth in techniques/technologies. Employers consistently report that they value [the following factors](https://i0.wp.com/bytebreach.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-36.png?ssl=1) in applicants (in-order):\n\n* A relevant work history\n* [Pertinent certifications](https://bytebreach.com/which-certifications-should-you-go-for/)\n* Formal education\n* [Everything else](https://www.reddit.com/r/hackthebox/comments/11hs9hl/comment/jawng7p/?context=3&utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=cybersecurity&utm_content=t3_142rs62)\n\nWith each step down, the impact of said factor on your employability drops-off significantly (i.e. 1 year of university isn't as impactful as 1 year working in cybersecurity). Other actions to improve your employability may include:\n\n* [Continue to leverage free resources to hone your craft or acquire new skills](https://bytebreach.com/hacking-helpers-learn-cybersecurity/).\n* [Pursue in-demand certifications to improve your employability](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/sgmqxv/mentorship_monday/hv7ixno/).\n* [Vie for top placement in competitive CTF competitions](https://ctftime.org/).\n* Foster a professional network via [jobs listings sites](https://www.weidert.com/blog/best-ways-to-gain-more-connections-on-linkedin) and [in-person conferences](https://infosec-conferences.com/).\n* [Take note of the feedback you receive in interviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/vg864z/mentorship_monday_post_all_career_education_and/id2tsr3/); consider expanding the aperture of jobs considered to include cyber-adjacent lines of work (software dev, systems administration, etc.) - this is a channel for you to build relevant years of experience.\n* Consider pursuing a degree-granting program (and internship experience while holding a student status).\n* [Post your resume for constructive feedback](https://bytebreach.com/how-to-write-an-infosec-resume/).\n* [Apply your skills into some projects in order to demonstrate your expertise](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/sxir9c/as_a_entry_level_professional_trying_to_get_into/hxsm5qn/).\n\n## What it's like\n\nCybersecurity is not a monolith. [There are many, many different kinds of roles that exist](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/smbnzt/mentorship_monday/hw8mw4k/). Your best bet to figuring out what a day-in-the-life is like in cybersecurity would be to first more narrowly discover what it is you want to do within the space. An exhaustive list would take quite a while, but each of us is - in some way - concerned with promoting a greater degree of confidence that the technologies we engage with operate in the way they are intended to. [You can consult this list of resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/sb7ugv/mentorship_monday/hux2869/), which include 1-on-1 interviews with staff from all across the industry to get a better idea.\n\n## School, Bootcamps, or Certifications?\n\nEarly in your cybersecurity career, there's often a point in weighing the pros/cons of how much to invest in your education in time, money, and labor. Importantly, [pursuing a degree is not a foregone conclusion](https://old.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/14w83m5/poll_do_you_have_a_degree/). This generally breaks down to choosing between pursuing a degree-granting program (and at what level: Associates/Bachelors/Masters/Doctorate), a bootcamp (typically either through a private/commercial vendor or public university), or going it alone (by way of entry-level technical employment and supplemental certifications). To that end, here are some resources for you to consider:\n\n* [On the risks of degree-granting programs](https://bytebreach.com/do-you-need-a-degree-for-a-job-in-cybersecurity/)\n* [On the risks of bootcamps](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/13472xp/comment/jiuv30n/?context=3)\n* [On the risks of going it alone \\(and also merits of a degree\\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/zjfgyt/comment/j0ljcfj/?context=3&utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=cybersecurity&utm_content=t3_142rs62)\n* [Considerations for choosing a university](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/13oakj9/comment/jl613eh/?context=3&utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=cybersecurity&utm_content=t3_142rs62)\n\n## Type of Degree\n\nGenerally, [I advocate an undergraduate education in Computer Science](http://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/14ve289/mentorship_monday_-_post_all_career_education_and_job_questions_here/jrfnk2x?context=3) (CompSci) more generally for engineering/individual contributor aspirations. However, employment can come from a wide-range of formal educational experiences (I have an undergraduate degree in Political Science, for example).\n\nAdditionally, there are a number of popular online programs that get brought up frequently in the subreddit you might consider as well (please note that I neither advocate for, nor am familiar with any of the below programs):\n\n* [Western Governors University \\(WGU\\)](https://www.wgu.edu/online-it-degrees/it-certifications.html#_)\n* [SANS](https://www.sans.edu/cyber-security-programs/bachelors-degree/)",

There's millions, *tens* of millions of very competent engineers in south Asia who can work remote, for bargain prices.

I didn't pass any certification, but I'd be happy to receive suggestions.\n\nAll the programming I've done in my life wasn't really fun.

From provisioning/de-provisioning thousands of users with my (basic) scripting skills --> to presenting security concerns I had found while pulling data, all in an effort to drive policy change (yikes) --> even leading daily scrum meetings.

I am simply temporary for an extended period of time. I have expressed my deep interest in being a full-time, non-intern member of the team. Unfortunately, they really want me to get my degree first.

                "Posting this again, hoping for some guidance. \n\nBackground (Tried to be as brief as possible, can answer any follow on questions in comments) Joined the Navy in 2011 and worked on the Navy's SOC for 2 years (2011-2013) and obtained my TS/SCI clearance as well as (Sec+, Linux+, CEH still active). I was subsequently accepted to the Naval Academy and went through 5 years of school (2013 - 2018 B.S. in IT). Then I commissioned and went to a ship where I was essentially the director of IT for two years (2019-2021)(I was the senior person who understood computer networks and communication suites/didn't think it was all black magic) with about 15 direct reports. Then my most recent role was at the Navy's HR organization working for the Enterprise IT sub organization originally brought on as a IT project manager for digital transformation. However, my GS-15 left the CISO position about 6 months in and since I was the only military member with Cyber experience I was given the opportunity to fill that role for the past year and a half as the \"Acting CISO\". I was the lead ISSM for multiple sub organizations with about 10 ISSMs/ISSO's reporting. During this time period I also obtained my GIAC Security Leadership (GSLC) certification and some basic Microsoft Azure, AWS, and Google cloud certs(think the 900 level ones) and I am now currently in a boot camp for CISSP with the hopes of obtaining it by the end of the summer.\nMy Question: Cut to now, I am now leaving the Navy and I cannot for the life of me figure out what level of job is appropriate for me to apply to. I feel like I am now stuck in a loop of too junior/not experienced enough for \"civilian world\" management and at the same time not technical enough for Individual Contributor roles. I can't even seem to really get an interview anywhere. Where do I go from here?",

                "Hello everyone, I was directed to have my intended post be posted in this thread. \n\nBackground: So a little bit about my background, I'm in my 30's with almost 14 years of professional experience. I have a military background, specifically in Nuclear power plant operations, focusing on the electrical side of things. After the military, I spent a year in field service, travelling around performing work centered around battery monitoring systems. For the last 6 1/2 to almost 7 years, I've been working at a data center on the critical environments side of the house. So the mechanical/electrical/controls side of the data center.\n\nWhile working at the data center, I went to school full time to earn a Bachelor's in Cyber Security this past May 2023. I was looking to study something different from my profession up to this point. On top of that, I've also started learning Python as a side hobby (night shifts are long and quiet).\n\nFor the past few months, I've been working with a Cyber Security consulting group who have enrolled me into Tenable's training program. While not mandatory for completing the consulting group\u2019s curriculum, I do have the option to earn Tenable's certifications in 3 of their tools. I've just recently completed the training program and should be moving into type of internship with the consulting group, with the potential to go \"full-time.\"\n\nFrom my understanding of the company, it's a contract position, taking on customer contracts and assisting them with Tenable products. Ideally, it would be a job that will allow me to leave my position at the data center to work full-time. But, seeing that it's contract work, I'm more than likely having to either keep my current job or seek another full-time position elsewhere (ideally somewhere to gain more cyber security experience).\n\nAll that being said, I understand that \"entry-level\" positions in Cyber Security aren't actually entry-level. As many posts in this sub point out, IT experience is incredibly ideal for branching into Cyber. So if the contract position's pay can offset the impending paycut from leaving my data center job, what are some suggested IT roles that I should really look into?\n\nAlso, I'm starting my pursuit of professional certs. My general plan is to get the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate, to help prepare me for CompTia Security+. In conjunction with that, probably look at Microsoft Certified: Azure Security Engineer Associate. Obviously, these are just starting points as far as certifications go. I've also been told Splunk is something to possibly dive into at some point.\n\nAny advice or critique would be much appreciated.",

Since I\u2019m without the traditional IT background, I feel like I\u2019m constantly playing catch up.\n\nAny tips on resources I can leverage? I\u2019m open to certs, training classes, free resources, etc.\n\nOn a different note, are there any jobs out there that are less technical? I do want to learn it regardless, but I realize I\u2019m happiest writing policies, facilitating projects, developing awareness training, developing verbiage, etc. I\u2019m not sure if there are security positions that would better allow for me to use these skills, or if my GRC role is the best option.",

(Also maybe reserves could be a good option with this?)\n\nAny advice from people who've gotten into the field in various ways would be appreciated. Thank you.",

                "The biggest differences are that in *most* European and UK systems, learners begin to specialise at an earlier stage, and undergrad is very subject-focused rather than the general education that makes up a significant portion of US undergrad degrees, so students at European/UK universities tend to be more advanced in their subject than US counterparts are at the same stage, but have fewer options for electives and such. That's an educational preference for you and your kids to decide on. And if course, the financial investment is so much higher in the US, which doesn't necessarily translate to higher quality. \n\nIf your kids ultimately want to work in the US, then most US employers will not know how to judge someone based on their university the way they do with US schools (depending on their field), and may give them more or less respect based on their attitude toward non-US people and institutions.",

                "It will entirely depend on which European country you are looking at, and which US universities you are comparing to. Education across the continent is completely different depending on where you look, same as the US. US colleges being more rigorous probably doesn't really stack up as a blanket statement, the US education system is known for being pretty lax at times in grading structures, retesting, retaking years etc.  \n\nHowever, there is definitely a possible discrimination factor at play. Some Americans are very similar to Indians that they tend to treat the top Ivy's as elites and if you don't go to them you will fail in life or hinder your career. This then feeds into the mentality of some top US companies who I think definitely can have an extreme bias towards top level domestic education regardless of quality of overseas equivalents. \n\nRealistically, if they get into somewhere like a top internationally respected for example UK university (Oxbridge, LSE, Imperial, Warwick, St Andrews, Durham even places like Manchester), they will be absolutely fine. But if you sent them to some mid tier university in another random European country...it is akin to sending them to some mid-level US state college. Looking at global university rankings helps understand the position of international universities vs specific US universities, but you also have to consider the industry they may want to apply in. Some US industries may simply have extreme domestic bias. \n\nMy feeling would be to settle where you want with a good respected education system, and if they REALLY feel the need to they can top it off with a US masters degree.",

But also it\u2019s not something I\u2019d worry about too much.\n\nThe US college experience is different, and likely more fun, than attending college in Europe.

                "Generalizing here but have experienced both, I\u2019d say in the EU there\u2019s a lot less handholding/lecturing/class work and a lot more self-studying.  Your entire grade depends on 1-2 papers. No one\u2019s going to check attendance, you decide how dedicated you want to be. I personally didn\u2019t find my program to very rigorous but that\u2019s one university in one country. The American college experience is definitely a thing and I\u2019m glad I experienced it bc it\u2019s one cultural phenomenon that the US does well (although at extortionate costs). \n\nAnother thing I\u2019ll note is in Europe, post university your career and job prospects are generally limited to the field you specialized in academically. That means little flexibility if you want to explore other kinds of work. In the US a degree is more like a checkbox and it\u2019s extremely common to see people doing work that has nothing to do with what they studied and excel at it. Europe is much more rigid which I personally would find frustrating. Maybe it could even be limiting their economy if they\u2019re not allocating their workforce efficiently\u2026",

I'd say only places like CalTech and MIT may actually be more rigorous. The UK seemed comparable to the US overall, actually. Of course if you are talking about Oxbridge or even Durham, they offer high quality education no doubt, but I am not sure about the rest from what I've been told by professors at those other schools. I've also worked with people from Spain, Italy, and Greece, and their undergraduate standards seemed a bit more loose. Now, grad school is a whole other game. In that regard, I think graduate schools in the US offer far more cutting-edge research opportunities compared to any other country in the world.",

                "Disclaimer: I have extensive experience in both, but can only speak regarding engineering/STEM. If you\u2019re not in that field this may not apply as much or at all. I went to the #1 globally ranked program for my profession, and then was recognized as a scholar and subsequently invited to Germany to work at their 3 top ranked STEM universities/programs for a couple of years, as well as major automotive companies. \n\nEuropean uni degrees are NOT comparable to American degrees, at least as far as STEM goes. Technically speaking, an American B.Sc is more equivalent to a M.Sc in most European countries. Even then, American B.Sc graduates are often much more qualified/skilled than their European M.Sc counterparts.\n\nWith that being said, this is not widely known at all. US->EU expats get shafted by this because somebody will read \u201cB.Sc\u201d and just throw your CV in the trash because they\u2019ll assume you\u2019re an unqualified university dropout. Conversely in the USA you\u2019ll receive better treatment and pay for a degree that is objectively weaker, but they\u2019ll see B.Sc and M.Sc and assume they\u2019re identical. Students with just a B.Sc here (Europe) are seen the same way Americans with Associates degrees are in the USA, but American companies and HR won\u2019t know any better and they\u2019ll hire you as if your European B.Sc is the same as an American B.Sc\n\nYou will find yourself way busier at American universities. You will constantly have projects, assignments, exams, etc\u2026 EU universities usually ONLY have exams, and often just one exam per course, per semester. Which one is harder is subjective. In the USA you will have a constant metric as to how you\u2019re doing in a subject and your grade is diversified since it\u2019s consisted of many different things, however you will always be busy. In European uni\u2019s you can essentially fuck around until the end of the semester. Many/most students don\u2019t study at all until a couple of weeks before the exam(s). However if you have just one bad day that happens to be on the exam day, you\u2019re fucked and need to start all over again. Exams tend to be recycled every semester/year and you just master the old exams and essentially copy and paste on exam day; however if they decide to change it or the course is new then you\u2019re fucked.\n\nAmerican Uni\u2019s teach you more and you will learn more skills and actual useful knowledge. My experience with European universities (mostly Germany) is much more negative. Lots of professors with a stick up their ass that like to rant about their tiny niche that won\u2019t be important to you unless you do a thesis with them. And at least for Germany you will be treated like shit. There is a much larger barrier and very little interaction between students and professors, and the universities are not accommodating at all. At American universities it is much more common to get to know your prof\u2019s, even personally; they\u2019re much more informal, caring, accommodating, and may even act as a mentor. If you have issues of any kind (personal, mental, disabilities, etc\u2026), the US is far better. If you have ADHD, anxiety, dyslexia, or anything like that then in the US you can often get assistance such as extended exam time in a less stressful environment at a time that works for you and the Professor. Here you\u2019re shit out of luck, and in Germany if you fail three exams you\u2019re kicked out of the program. \n\nTLDR: You need a masters to work in EU. Only a Bachelors in US. A US B.Sc \u2248 the work of an EU M.Sc, but companies don\u2019t know any better and will think US B.Sc=EU B.Sc. You\u2019ll receive the same treatment in both with an M.Sc but you\u2019ll be more qualified and skilled by the end if it\u2019s an American one.\n\nFeel free to PM me with any questions or whatever",

I didn't feel unprepared or behind my peers at Harvard in any way (except maybe for the fact that English wasn't my native language, but that won't be the case for your children).\n\n  \nFor me, the biggest difference was that many of my classmates at Harvard entered grad school with debts up to hundreds of thousands of dollars from their American undergrad education. In contrast, I started grad school completely debt-free and was therefore able to pay off my grad school debt very quickly.\n\n  \nSince then, my advice to everyone, even non-expats, has always been to avoid attending college in the US if possible, unless you get a full ride or something like a 90% discount. It doesn't make financial sense to spend so much on *any* undergrad education when there are so many places where it costs from zero to very little. You can always attend a prestigious American school for grad school, where you're also more likely to make valuable contacts in your specific field of work.",

To maximize \"backward compatibility\" with the US, your kids would be best served going to a top university in the British Isles with a similar-ish system and lots of internship/recruitment opportunities at American companies.\n\nI grew up in France and the French higher education system is byzantine and not designed for foreign students and employers, although it looks like they're awkwardly trying to retrofit that in top institutions. There are at least 3 ways to get to an engineering degree (2-year cramming school + 3-year eng school, 5-year eng school, 'parcours universitaire') and higher education institutions sometimes dictate what kind of internship you have to take each year, with a contract involving them. So in general, studying in France as an 'undergrad' only makes sense sense if intending to live in France.",

                "There are a bunch of world rankings of universities out there, and the simple reality is that the US dominates them. Cambridge and Oxford are near the top, and the best one or two universities in a few other countries might crack the top 50, but it is just an objective fact about the world that America makes the most great universities.\n\nNow, does this matter?\n\nIf your kids are eligible for the world's best schools, they're gonna be fine wherever. Cambridge vs Harvard, who gives a shit.\n\nIf your kids are not at that tier, going to a solid American school will probably have wider relevance than going to a solid French school. The brand for schools like Duke will have broader recognition in more fields than LMU Munich or PSL in France. And it's probably easier to get into the Dukes (lower national ranking; admissions system that values narrative about international upbringing, etc.)\n\n\nSo in that context, American schools are probably preferable.\n\nThen there's cost. Imagine you saved $150,000 by sending a kid to a fine European school instead of a great American one. Put that money in a trust, invest it at a 5% real rate of return, and 43 years later, your 65 year old kid has a nest egg worth $1.2M in present-day buying power. They could likely afford a barbones retirement on that without any other funding. Assuming they still actually earn money and save and whatnot during their career, that sets them up to be quite comfortable, while still getting a reasonable education.\n\nMostly though, you need to decide what you're optimizing for. Highest heights of income and professional achievement? America, end of discussion. Complex mix of self-actualizing life goals? Fundamentally unknowable; let the kid lead their own life.",

In fact nurses tend to be way under paid in Europe. Any non stem non medical degree program isn't worth it, unless they want to be a teacher and that might also be an issue moving to US. So if it requires a big certification exam that is not universal, Like IT certs, then the career choice could be an issue based on EU uni degree and US certification system.",

The alumni network of a US university is a great help in the job search, especially at more \u201cprestigious\u201d schools. But who\u2019s to say they want to work in the US after living in Europe?

                "Relevant to this whole discussion is how exactly you plan to retire in Europe with your young children. Are you planning to find work and obtain residence in the EU before you retire, or does your plan include pursuing a retirement visa/golden visa? The options for the latter are quite limited, and will likely have a big effect on the secondary school system that your kids have access to \u2013 of course as EU residents they would be able to apply to and attend EU higher ed institutions more easily, but they kind of secondary education they get will determine what college/university they're eligible to enter immediately.\n\nI don't think the question of name recognition is that important, honestly. The quality of education is comparable, or the relevant accreditations regimes wouldn't be compatible, so the question comes down to which schools you're comparing, what programs, and what kind of career they pursue after they graduate. An EU degree might be less recognizable in the US, but it will be more easily understood by EU employers, while a US degree from a non-Ivy or similar probably won't mean much to EU employers other than \"Yup, that's a BA/MBA/whatever.\" My experience in the Netherlands is that a Canadian BA from a highly ranked university was in many ways less rigorous than a BEd from a very poorly ranked Dutch professional college (a step lower than a true university in the Dutch system). Despite the higher level of difficulty, it's unlikely my Dutch degree would be \"worth\" more outside of the Netherlands beyond the credential, but it's really the networking and professionalisation you do that makes any degree beneficial in the long term.",

A lot of my university classmates did IB (International Baccalaureate) and were very well equipped to study at university level. Even having your children go through IB and knowing Portuguese will give them good chances to attend a good US university if cost is not an issue. \n\nI studied in the Netherlands at one of the University Colleges. Quite a large number of my former classmates went on to study in the UK or at prestigious universities elsewhere. Most of them now have good jobs, including some in the US. \n\nAfter over 7 years in tech companies, I can safely say that where you studied is only important to get you a foot in the door.

But your grading is typically done by underpaid grad students and it's a fairly easy to game the system. Your not learning much in terms of content or critical thinking, albeit you will have excellent time management skills coming out of a top-flight University there. \n\nEuropean Universities are an entirely different ballgame. There is less busy work overall, but your entire grade is composed by a handful of papers or test, and those test are not some multiple choices bullshit. You have to be highly creative, orginal, and have a firm grasp of the subject matter in order to excel. \n\nThe ranking systems everyone here is going on about has nothing to do with quality of education, it's about research output which is a statistic that is gamed rather than earned. \n\nIn the American system your handheld throughout the degree because your treated like a customer, in the European one nobody gives a shit and you either sink or swim on your merit. \n\nOf course the above is all program dependent.

                "European universities, as far as I know, have governments that check to make sure they meet minimum standards. They need to be certified by education departments, etc. This ensures that there is a minimum standard, and that it is, if not compatible across the EU, it is pretty translatable. If a Romanian nurse wants to work in Norway, the Norwegian board of certifying healthcare educations will look at pre-made comparisons of Romanian and Norwegian nursing syllabuses, standards etc.\n\nTo my knowledge such things do not exist in the US, where anyone can call an institution a university and it is often the profession who certifies the degrees. So the reputation of the univerisity becomes much more important. If an American nurse wants to work in Norway, said nurse will need to do an appaling amount of paperwork herself, that would have been done on the government level between European nations.\n\nIf I was chosing for myself with no financial considerations, I'd pick a European university unless the Ivy League ones in the US were an option. Then I'd have to think about it. Unless you can attend a university with an international reputation, US degrees will be far more limited in application.\n\nIn practice, university in a number of European nations is free, and compared to the cost of the Ivy league ones, I'd not seriously consider them.\n\nTl;dr The European average is far more useful, although the top levels in the US are very competitive. Europe is far far better value for money.\n\nEdit: The European nations I am familiar with admit students to university based only on academic qualifications and more popular or presigous studies tend to be very, very competitive. In the US, as I understand it, you are more of a customer, and money can get someone faily average admitted ahead of someone with better grades. Up to a point.",

Considering the average bachelors degree in Europe is 3 years of study versus 4 in the US, and only one of those degrees having half the degree credits consist of general education classes, there\u2019s a clear winner as to which one is more rigorous.\n\nAlso, what countries were you thinking? That could help a lot with the answers. We obviously know it will be some sort of Western European country but at the same time Europe is 44 countries.\n\nI\u2019m a US/UK dual citizen who grew up in the US and is studying in a prestigious UK university. Honestly, if I wasn\u2019t accepted into said prestigious university (which also ranked high for my particular course, and is high ranking in the world), I would have stayed in the US. I live in a state which has one of the highest in state tuition for state universities in the country so it was obvious I was gonna go to the UK where I could have the opportunity to study at a prestigious, respected university without burning my pockets too much. Another good thing about was that I paid the same fixed annual tuition fee, which is relatively inexpensive for a university of such status; however, this can depend on the university. Though I assume I\u2019d you decide to live there your kids will be considered \u201chome\u201d status to which case their tuition is already capped by the UK government (as of now anyway lol).\n\nThe UK university system focuses on depth rather than breadth. This means people specialise from the start and it\u2019s usually hard to switch gears if you have a change of heart. I have 1-2 assessments that count towards a whole module (class) grade, which could be either an essay or an exam. So there is an insane amount of pressure during exam time because 1-2 assessments determines your whole grade for that class, and if you have a shit day or you unluckily get a strict moderator marking your paper, your grades/overall grades will pay. It was still nice that I did modules relevant to my degree from the jump and didn\u2019t waste half of my degree trying to get general ed in, because a lot of my distain and boredom in high school was due to having to do classes I didn\u2019t like (I HATED english and science, but LOVED history/geography/math, and my electives).\n\nSo yeah, IMO I think a degree from a UK university is comparable to that of the US, if you end up having the privilege to go to a high tier university in the UK. I know people mucking about who either go to the UK for the experience or to get the degree and fuck off after graduation, so they don\u2019t give a rats what uni it is so long as they get to stay in the UK.

In fact, many of them have partnerships with American universities with whom they offer dual degrees.\n\nThe bigger concern should be networking. If your kids are thinking of working in the US after graduating, then going to an American university simply makes more sense due to the fact that they'll build a significantly more robust professional network in the US which will then make it easier for them to land a job there. For the same reason, if they want to work in Europe then it makes more sense for them to attend a European university (assuming that they have the right to stay and work there after graduating).

It\u2019s nearly impossible, say experts on the inner workings of Washington\u2013and especially hard once a department has been cemented inside the president's Cabinet. \u201cAny kind of structural change runs into certain kinds of fundamental barriers,\u201d explained Harrison Wellford, a former top White House official who Carter tasked with proposing a series of government reorganization plans. \n\n> The government, it turns out, is almost specifically built to resist shrinkage. First, no matter how much controversy an agency may be engulfed in, it still has its entrenched allies. Department leaders and their underlings often got their jobs precisely because they\u2019re so good at working an inside game with the White House and Congress to preserve their turf. There are also the interest groups that fought to get a department launched in the first place, and lobby for funding every year. In the VA\u2019s case, that would be the veterans themselves. (They immediately jumped down Carson\u2019s throat: The national commander of the Veterans of Foreign Wars said he \"could not disagree with Dr. Carson more,\" and Retired Army Major Gen.

                "Honestly, we all have unique and have beautiful bodies. I am accepting my body with fat around my tummy, I always carry 10-20 \u2018extra\u2019 pounds. I have long thin arms and legs and an hourglass figure (with the tummy). My torso is short. I am short waisted. My mom was from Portugal and I have a traditional fleshy women\u2019s body, big boobs, a good sized booty. \n\nHillary has a longer torso and is longer waisted. She has shorter legs as compared to her torso, she is athletic in build. She\u2019s slim and keeps in shape. \n\nShe must have so much self hatred over her body. The medical procedures!  The face even, at her age?  Elongating the legs. Out of proportion fake tetas. \n\nThis woman is not my icon. My icons love their bodies and accept them. I think about America Ferreira - talent, a beautiful person with a woman\u2019s healthy body. She is my icon. Lana Del Ray is also my icon. A gifted musician with a beautiful soul and figure. Cameron Diaz is my icon. Talent galore and an athletic build, very natural. \n\nThese are examples of women in the public eye who love themselves and present as who they are. America and Cameron are Latinas. Their bodies are different from one another. Yet they are authentic \n\nHow in hell is Hillary still getting press!!??  Her Living Clearly method is such a farce. We don\u2019t see America and Cameron identifying as perfect mommies or objectifying their children. Cameron and her husband tried to get pregnant and could not; they were open about a surrogate. \n\nI\u2019m really dumbfounded that this woman (Hillary) has any following at all. She identifies as a mother and sexy breast feeding fool. She hates her body. She hates her face. She hates herself so much that she pretends to be Spanish. \n\nTwo narcissistic parents tragically raising 7 innocent children. One a killer. One a faker who hates herself. \n\nThere is something very wrong with the world here.",

                "I really don't understand what direction her new SM management team are thinking of going with her IG. \n\nPre-Griftmas, she was considered a \"momfluencer\", and that's because AB was able to get sponsors and all of her opportunities for her (Mom Brain). *AND* AB was always begging his fans to follow her IG. She never gained any followers organically. \n\nWhat she did back then is the same shit she's trying to pull now. Pics of all her kids. Mirror selfies. Terrible \"exercise\" videos. Basically a \"Admire me you fat jealous Karens! Look at how much better my life is than yours. Look at how easily I bounce back from back to back pregnancies.\" Any criticism of her narrative and she'd lecture her audience to include her in the inclusivity too! She'd even dox people. \n\nSo what's the shift? What's the plan to gain sponsors? Hillary doesn't have any skills nor wisdom to share. Plus she's so lazy. She won't cook or prepare recipes. She isn't a certified fitness instructor. She has no clue what she's doing health and fitness wise. She doesn't know any mom hacks because she doesn't actually rear her children. She has ZERO fashion sense or taste. She has no skincare regimen other than constantly getting invasive shit done to her face. She literally has NOTHING. She *IS* nothing. She's not even a little bit funny \ud83d\ude29. \n\nIn this post Covid, state of recession, wildfire tragedy filled world, looking at her IG, she and AB are so out of touch. How is she at all relatable? Who else could afford multiple, much less 7, kids in Manhattan? Why should anyone care to look at these WASP kids that, I'm sorry, don't do anything special at all? Her uncurated IG makes her life look chaotic and unappealing. Not at all relatable which is what she's aiming for. She has these unrealistic ideas of what she thinks moms do, or how they feel and she misses the mark completely EVERY TIME. \n\nAnd I'm not even getting into her actual grift and lies! \n\nSo what's the strategy? She's getting all of these paid for positive comments for zero content but even those people will get bored real fast. Are they just trying to find ways to empty ABs bank account? \n\nEither way, I'm just here to watch another Hilaria failure \ud83d\ude06\ud83c\udf7f.",

                "I'm an HISD parent, and while I certainly have my own opinions about what's going on, I'm going to try to stick to just the facts.\n\n* The state dismissed the elected HISD school board and fired the existing superintendent.\n* The board was replaced with new members chosen by the state TEA commissioner from an open call for applications. The state also hired Mike Miles to be the new superintendent.\n* Miles was superintendent of Dallas ISD a few years ago. Supposedly some struggling schools improved fairly quickly under his leadership, but it's fair to say he was not extremely popular by the time he left the job. Many of his plans were not continued there after he left, so it's unclear how sustainable and lasting his methods are in the long term.\n* After Dallas, he was working in Colorado running a network of charter schools. He's a big supporter of the charter school system.\n* Shortly after he was hired to lead HISD, he selected a few dozen struggling schools to implement his new plan, which he calls the \"New Education System\" (NES).\n* In addition to the schools that will be forced into NES, quite a few more (\\~100 I think?) opted to join NES voluntarily. The reason I've heard being given for this is that the principals at those schools felt they would be forced into NES eventually, so they wanted to get ahead of the curve and hopefully have some say in how the system is implemented at their campus.\n* For the rest of the HISD's schools (generally speaking, the higher-performing ones), it will apparently be mostly business as usual for now.\n* For NES schools, the teachers had to re-interview for their jobs. Teachers at NES schools will receive significantly higher pay than teachers at \"regular\" schools. There will also be additional staff on hand to do lesson planning, preparation work, discipline, etc. The way Miles sells it is that teachers should focus on teaching, and nothing else. The plan includes an evaluation system for teachers that includes test scores, student surveys, overall campus achievement, and some other things. The implication is that the NES schools will be expected to improve rapidly.\n* Miles's plan to pay for this so far has been to dramatically reduce administrative staff. I believe he has let go around 3,000 people so far. There's also been some talk about eliminating contracts with outside vendors and some things like that, but not many details as far as I know.\n* There is no set timeline or specific criteria for the state to turn control of HISD back over to an elected board. It's pretty much at the discretion of the TEA commissioner.",

                "So far, lots of job cuts, overworking existing staff, dismantling libraries, and new teacher evaluations based on student grades.\n\nThis guy was run out of Dallas. The only conclusion is that they\u2019re trying to deliberately implode HISD.",
                "Miles is basically creating a two-tier education system. One is business as usual (the so-called \u201cgood schools\u201d), the other one is being turned into a copy of the charter school system he built. Those are the NES schools (New Education System). Those are the ones whose libraries are being converted into Zoom Rooms.",
                "The state took over and is brought in a guy who is making a lot of changes. \n\nThe existing system was broken, will this better? Not likely but time will tell. \n\nThe problem with forced education is especially in undeserved communities the family structure at home that pushes middle class + students to succeed and strive for more doesn't exist. The parents are often working odd hour/multiple jobs and the kids are left to fend for themselves. \n\nAlso some kids don't want to be in school, have no real parental guidance outside of school, cause trouble but are forced to be there and disrupt the classroom. This forces even the best teachers to spend time dealing with disruptions as opposed to teaching those who want to learn. \n\nIt is a fucked system, we probably should accept that not everybody is 4 year college bound. We should start testing not only math, language, reading but also mechanical aptitude. \nCreate a system that gets kids through 5th, 6th, or 7th grade with the basics and those who test well in the regular education standards move to college prep. While those who test well in other areas move to more career focused training. Kids could come out of high-school with basic budgeting skills and be entry level certified mechanics, plumbers, electricians, etc.. \n\nThis shit won't happen, the Republicans don't have the balls to actually make any real change and the Democrats are too scared to tell a parent their kid probably ain't ivy league material but they could make a decent living and retire comfortably if we get them started now with a good blue collar skills education.",
                "Abbott hates liberals so he hand picked HISD to fuck them over. TEA now has full control of the district and the state will run it into the ground. I am so happy I don't fucking teach anymore. I hate that education is always a political issue. Just let teachers teach.",

                "The \"New Education System\" will be implemented in the 28 schools in the feeder patterns of North Forest High School, Wheatley High School, and Kashmere High School. All of the principals, assistant principals, teachers, and staff at those schools had to reapply for their jobs. Those positions were also all opened up to the community at large so anyone could apply. In theory, they hired the very best teachers for these schools. \n\nThe teachers are getting paid more but there are differences in how much teachers get paid based on what subjects they teach. Language arts gets paid the most, followed by special education, then math, then science, then social studies, then Career and Technical Education (CTE), and finally fine arts and physical education. There will be a difference of $28,000 to $30,000 between the minimum a ELA teacher makes versus the minimum for a fine arts teacher. The difference isn't much better between ELA and social studies. \n\nTeachers are supposed to have some type of assistance in their classroom like teacher interns or learning assistants. Teachers are supposed to be able to focus on teaching with less time on mundane tasks like making copies and grading. Students who are disruptive are supposed to be sent to \"learning centers\" where they will follow the lesson on a computer, as well as receive specialized help. \n\nTo fund these teacher raises, Miles slashed the staff at the central office by 25%. More than half of those jobs were already vacant but about 600 people had their jobs eliminated.\n\nThe curriculum will be standardized at all of the NES schools. Teachers will be teaching from scripts with little room for deviation. They will have timers in their rooms and will be expected to adhere to the rigid schedules set for them. \n\nTeacher evaluations in the NES schools are partly based (about 30%) on student performance on standardized, state testing (the STAAR exams), along with overall school performance and evaluation of teachers in their classroom. Basing teacher evaluations on student performance will be rolled out for all teachers in HISD starting in the 2025 - 2026 school year.\n\nAt the NES schools, Miles is eliminating libraries and librarians. The former library spaces will be used for the above mentioned \"learning centers\". They aren't removing the books just the staff needed to guide students to appropriate books and maintain the collection of books.\n\n57 schools opted to implement some parts of the NES this year. Teachers at those schools do not receive the pay raises teachers at NES schools receive. Miles intends to implement NEW to more schools next year. \n\nI have yet to hear what Miles intends to do with the magnet programs and schools. I don't believe he will leave them alone; he just hasn't turned his attention to them, yet.\n\nThere is a new non-profit news organization in Houston, the Houston Landing, that has been doing a good job of following all of the changes being implemented by Superintendent Miles. You can also find good information at Houston Public Media and the Houston Chronicle, not chron.com, but the actual complete website.",

            "selftext": "Back in February 2023, [DeSantis referred to subjects he deemed \"useless\" as \"Zombie Studies\"](https://washingtonstand.com/commentary/zombie-studies-desantis-declares-allout-war-on-university-dei-crt-in-education-manifesto).\n\n>\"The core curriculum must be grounded in the actual history, the actual philosophy that has shaped Western civilization. Our institutions are going to be graduating students with degrees that are going to be meaningful. **We don\u2019t want students to go through, at taxpayer expense, and graduate with a degree in Zombie Studies.**\"\n\nDeSantis also went on to, rather hypocritically, say this:\n\n>\\[...\\] \"A lot of hiring decisions are done by faculty committees, and if they have a certain worldview that they want to promote, those are the kinds of candidates they\u2019re going to bring in. And, if you don\u2019t toe that line, you\u2019re not going to get hired.  \n>  \n>University presidents may go out and recruit directly. Boards of Trustees will be able to do a lot of this approving directly. And that\u2019s going to make a huge difference in terms of making sure, not only do we have high quality faculty, but we're not applying some type of ideological litmus test to be able to be hired in the first place.\"\n\nAs well as stated that what education students receive would be beholden to what politicians and taxpayers want, because \"Florida schools run on taxpayer money\":\n\n>\"**They reported that, and it's a lot of money, and it's not the best use of your money. Those bureaucracies are not representative of what the people of this state and the taxpayers of this state want.** DEI (diversity, equity, inclusion) bureaucracies are hostile to academic freedom, and really, they constitute a drain on resources, and end up \u2014 certainly around the country \u2014 contributing to higher costs as these bureaucracies metastasize.\"\n\nBy \"what the people of this state and what the taxpayers of this state want\", he's referring to the concept of \"voter mandate\", which has been echoed by other Florida Republicans, including Rep. Jenna Persons-Mulicka (R-Fort Myers). She has used the concept of \"voter mandate\" in her justification for sponsoring the 6-week abortion ban bill that Gov. Ron DeSantis signed into law earlier this year.\n\nPer Wikipedia:\n\n>\"In representative democracies, a mandate is the authority granted by a constituency to act as its representative. **Elections, especially ones with a large margin of victory, are often said to give the newly elected government or elected official an implicit mandate to put into effect certain policies.** When a government seeks re-election they may introduce new policies as part of the campaign, seek voter approval, and say they are seeking a 'new mandate'. **Governments and elected officials may use language of a 'mandate' to lend legitimacy to actions that they take while in office.**\"\n\nRon DeSantis won in a landslide in the 2022 Florida gubernatorial elections (59% vs. 40%), which has now resulted in him claiming \"I have voter mandate\" when, for example, rejecting the College Board's AP courses on African-American History and Psychology in Florida, as well as making other broadly unpopular changes to Florida education, such as banning all diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs in Florida colleges and universities; signing \"Don't Say Gay\" laws; and more.\n\nThis is in spite of the 6-week ban and DeSantis's education policies being highly unpopular with Florida voters, including [75% of residents either somewhat or strongly opposing the 6-week ban, including 61% of Republicans](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/ron-desantis-signs-6-week-abortion-ban-law-florida-rcna78989). [91% of prospective college students also disagree with the governor's policies](https://www.forbes.com/sites/petergreene/2023/03/31/survey-1-in-8-florida-incoming-freshmen-plan-to-flee-desantiss-education-policies/?sh=1448d43442df).\n\nMore evidence against DeSantis's \"voter mandate\" claim [comes from polling website FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ron-desantis-is-doubling-down-on-his-education-crusade-will-it-work-with-gop-voters-in-2024/):\n\n>Polls suggest that voters overall have become increasingly wary of moves to ban critical race theory (CRT) and other discussions of race in schools. A February Data for Progress poll, for instance, found that an overwhelming majority of respondents were in favor of teaching issues like racism and slavery, among other things, in K-12 schools.  \n>  \n>Among likely voters, **83% said that slavery should be discussed \"in an age-appropriate manner\", compared with 11% of respondents who said it shouldn\u2019t be taught at all**. Teaching about the **American history of racism and racial equality, meanwhile, had similarly high support (79%) among those surveyed \u2014 as did discussions of modern-day racism and racial equality (69%) and social and political activism (66%)**.  \n>  \n>Data for Progress also asked voters whether they supported Florida's push against the AP African American Studies course, **and two-thirds of likely voters (\\~66%) said they would support this class \\[AP African-American Studies\\] being taught at high schools in their own communities**. Of course, there were racial and partisan fissures when it came to just how much voters supported this curriculum \u2014 **but an overwhelming majority of Democrats (89%), a sizable majority of independent voters (69%) and just under half of Republicans (44%) said they were in favor**.\n\n[Florida Politics also noted](https://floridapolitics.com/archives/561035-poll-majorities-oppose-ron-desantis-backed-stop-woke-and-parental-rights-laws/) that \"majorities opposed Ron DeSantis-backed \u2018Stop WOKE\u2019 and parental rights laws\".\n\n>A majority of Florida voters disapprove of two key pieces of legislation on social issues backed by Gov. Ron DeSantis, according to a new survey.  \n>  \n>Released Monday, the fresh Spectrum News/Siena College Poll shows **50% of respondents oppose the \"Parental Rights in Education\" measure, which critics have pejoratively called the \"Don't Say Gay\" law. Just 44% of respondents approve of the legislation.**  \n>  \n>The Parental Rights law bans classroom \"instruction on sexual orientation or gender identity\" for students in kindergarten through third grade, or \"in a manner that is not age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards\".  \n>  \n>The \"Stop WOKE\" Act, which is still being litigated in the courts, prohibits the teaching of so-called 'critical race theory' (CRT) in K-12 classrooms and workplaces. **Similarly, it is a political loser, with 51% disapproval against just 34% approval.**  \n>  \n>Central to the unpopularity of both measures is a significant minority of Republicans. A full 28% of them disapprove of the so-called \"Don\u2019t Say Gay\" law, showing that the negative branding of the legislation left an impression on these respondents. Meanwhile, a staggering 38% of Republicans - or 4 in 10 - disapprove of \"Stop WOKE\", against just 48% approval (5 in 10).  \n>  \n>The overall opprobrium against both these pieces of legislation extends to all age groups, except in one case. A majority of respondents between the ages of 50 and 64 back the Parental Rights in Education legislation, with 52% approval against just 37% disapproval. But otherwise, the measure is underwater among people of all ages.  \n>  \n>The measures are also underwater with both White voters and Black voters. However, the Parental Rights in Education law is backed by a plurality of Latino voters, with 49% support against 46% disapproval.  \n>  \n>The Spectrum News/Siena College poll of 669 likely voters was taken before Hurricane Ian, between Sept. 18 and Sept. 25. **Republicans made up 34% of respondents, Democrats 33%, and Independent/Other 28%.** The poll had a 4.5-point margin of error.\n\nSo, when DeSantis refers to \"what the people of this state and the taxpayers of this state want\", **he's only referring to the Republican voters who elected him, and not all Floridians**. DeSantis was elected in a landslide because Republican voters turned out in droves to vote for him. [Per Politico](https://www.politico.com/newsletters/florida-playbook/2023/01/25/a-closer-look-at-desantis-blowout-win-00079357):\n\n>\"Republicans still showed up in substantial numbers...about 7.7 million Florida voters cast ballots. GOP voter turnout was 67.3%, compared to 52% for Democrats, and 38.5% turnout for independents and those registered with minor parties. This Republican turnout advantage is higher than it was in the tea party wave year of 2010 (when Rick Scott narrowly won his first gubernatorial race), and may be the highest ever for the GOP.  \n>  \n>\\[...\\] Some 65% of Florida voters cast their ballots before Election Day through either early voting or voting by mail. But more than two-thirds of Republicans \u2014 72% \u2014 still voted in-person. Contrast that with Democrats, where 54% voted in-person. Democrats had the edge in mail-in voting, but **the majority of voters \u2014 51% \u2014 who cast ballots at early voting sites or on Election Day were Republican**.\"\n\nAs DeSantis's policies only seem to be supported among \"a majority of respondents between the ages of 50 and 64 who back the Parental Rights in Education legislation, with 52% approval against just 37% disapproval\", he's letting white, [largely male](https://floridaphoenix.com/2022/10/05/desantis-job-approval-ratings-fluctuate-far-more-men-than-women-support-his-performance/) Republican old farts determine the fate of Florida's future. DeSantis is also falsely claiming that this one demographic gives him a \"voter mandate\".\n\nAsk yourself: Do *you* want your child's future to be determined by an old, racist Republican minority? Or the \"Moms for Liberty\" who support DeSantis's policies, [even though an overwhelming majority of moms and women voters reject DeSantis's agenda](https://www.momsrising.org/newsroom/overwhelming-majority-of-mom-women-voters-reject-desantis-agenda-new-national-survey-finds)? How about the Daughters of the Confederacy and the Sons of Confederate Veterans, even though [only 4 in 10 Floridians want Confederate monuments to remain](https://floridapolitics.com/archives/247681-poll-4-10-florida-voters-want-confederate-monuments-stay-put/), and [75% of Americans disapprove of Confederate monuments nationwide](https://www.splcenter.org/news/2022/10/18/survey-confederate-monuments-politics-religion)?\n\nDo you want what your child can and cannot learn in school to be dictated by them? If not, then fight DeSantis and his loyalists at every turn. The fate and future of Florida's children is at stake here.",

Either way, I'm sorry you had to live through that and you certainly didn't deserve that on the basis of being a guy.\n\nUnfortunately, a lot of societies determine a man's worth on his ability to produce and provide; a broke, unemployed man is seen as useless and a wealthy, hardworking man is seen as useful. Women and children, on the other hand, have intrinsic value in these same societies. If you've ever heard the phrase \"women and children first\" while a shipping sinking, you know what I mean.\n\nDo this: \n\nFocus on YOUR needs and desires. If you feel like pursuing higher education, do so in spite of whatever your family does or says. If you don't have the grades for a traditional 4 year college, explore a trade at a community college.\n\nLearn how to differentiate abuse from criticism (this can be tricky), and don't put up with abuse at all. As you already know, women can be just as abusive as men, often in more devious ways.\n\nThis may be a hot take, but try to avoid self-described feminists. Many people who hate men or are prejudiced against them cloak themselves in this label in order to justify their shitty behavior, man-bashing and so forth.\n\nAnd remember: there is no such thing as \"male privilege\" - unless of course you count the \"privilege\" of mandatory enrolment in Selective Service, higher rates of incarceration and suicide, shorter life spans, exposure to higher amounts of risk on the job, higher expenses for driver's insurance...",

I understand cybersecurity and programming are two very different fields, however, in the context of my courses I feel I am learning how to program far more effectively than I am learning cybersecurity.  \nLike, my lecturer won't even give us any real tasks.

CISSP has seemed like a reasonable goal. r/CISSP is very helpful but I also want to make sure I'm not just drinking the kool-aid over there, so wanted to post here for another take. Earlier this year I began to study for this cert but there were two things I've read online that made me question moving forward:\n\n1. This is a cert for managers - I would like to eventually be in management roles, however I think that is still 3-5+ years on the horizon. On the flip side, many technical jobs will still put CISSP on job postings.\n2. There are so many cyber grads that in about 5 years the Cyber Job market will be oversaturated with workers.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on these two concerns? I've come across many success stories from people who got CISSP certified.

So far I have zeroed in on OSCP and Burp-suite Certified Practitioner. Since my area of job focus is on web application security, I really like what Burp-suite Practitioner focuses on. But looking at numerous job posts, it is not well recognized and I see most organizations asking for OSCP.\r  \nSo far I had not been applying for roles wanting to clear CEH first, which I just did. But am not very hopeful for a role given the market conditions right now. Considering I have been unemployed for the last 4 months, I want to focus only on one certification in terms of OSCP vs Burp-suite.\r  \nAny advice from experienced cybersecurity professionals/hiring managers here would be extremely helpful. Also please feel free to share if you think there can be a better approach to what I am trying to accomplish.\r  \nThanks for taking out your time to read this.",

We admitted him because of our holistic review which found he would benefit the Harvard community greatly.",

Otherwise they\u2019re going to lose their donor group.",
                "Legacy brings in a ton of money, much of which is used for low income student scholarships.  A major advantage of attending Harvard is making connections with these legacy students and their wealthy influential families.

                "This just seems like the Biden administration opening an investigation for purely political reasons. \n\nThe left has been pushing the narrative of \u201cbut what about legacy admissions!?\u201d since the Supreme Court struck down admitting based on race but it\u2019s not the same thing at all.  \n\nUniversities are free to basically choose their student body any way they please - so long as they\u2019re not breaking the law.  Harvard\u2019s problem was that they were clearly breaking the law.  \n\nThere are no laws against admitting students whose parents can actually pay sticker price.  This inquiry is going to go nowhere.  The Biden Administration obviously knows that too.",
                "Part of legacy admissions is the perpetuation of classism, where the very best education is offered to the elite and everyone else gets what's left. Furthermore, as OP noted, these universities have enough endowments that they don't need to charge tuition pretty much ever again.\n\nI'd rather use an IQ test than \"did your great uncle go here?\" as an admission criteria.\n\nEDIT: Upon further consideration, I think we have to ask \"What are these schools for?\" Yes, they exist to educate people, but why? Is it so the student will be successful? Is it so that the nation will be more successful by having a deep pool of talent? I think it's easier to decide how to handle questions about admissions once you figure out what you're really trying to accomplish.",
                "I don't think there's any legal remedy to legacy admissions because going to college is not a right and preferential treatment based on if their family went there isn't banned legally.\n\n\nPersonally I came around to actually supporting legacy admissions based on an argument I never heard before. It benefits every other student by giving them networking access to the powerful and connected elite. One of the prime benefits of going to college is networking opportunities and removing this would be a disadvantage to average people seeking a better life through universities.",

                "SS: In the wake of the Supreme Court's striking down of race-based affirmative action, civil rights groups have utilized the legal momentum to challenge Harvard's legacy admissions program.\n\nAs a bit of context, many highly selective universities across the nation informally practice \"legacy admissions\", a practice in which students of alumni or prominent donors often get a \"leg up\" in admissions processes. This practice is not a formalized admissions program, but is often used by universities to cull influence with prominent alumni and encourage donations and giving from the wealthy parents of prospective admits. It should be recognized however that legacy admissions, though it is often cast as \"buying your way\" into a school, isn't quite that in reality.\n\n At Princeton University, for example, [over thirty percent of legacy admits](https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2023/07/princeton-legacy-senior-survey-frosh-survey-gpa-sat-act-career) are admitted in contrast to the overall admit rate of 5 percent. While this is substantially higher than the overall admit pool, the demographics and backgrounds of legacy admits are often quite different, with many having a higher rate of academic and extracurricular achievement in comparison to their non-legacy peers. Additionally, the thirty percent admit rate for legacy students should be considered in the broader admissions context. Thirty percent admit rate at an institution like Princeton is quite high. But it is still below the norm for the vast majority of universities in the United States. \n\nMy take on the whole thing: I have no problem with getting rid of legacy admissions. Institutions like Harvard and Princeton have enough money that they can functionally sustain themselves on their endowments alone, and I truly doubt that the upside from admits is enough to justify the possibility that equally qualified applicants are denied because a legacy admit is a more \"practical\" choice to admit based on the politics of such an admission.\n\nWhat do yall think?",
                "Legacy admissions help first time students in obtaining legacy status for their families; especially if they are minorities attending university for the first time. \n\nCNN\u2019s Smerconish gives a great argument in the attached video below. \n\nEdit: to clear confusion.\n\n https://www.cnn.com/videos/us/2023/07/08/smr-defense-of-legacy-admissions.cnn",
                "Ohhhhhhhhh Fancy....\n\nGo ahead, but its just performative  nonsense.  Schools accept people whose parents donate a lot of money to the school   That doesn't harm minorities.  This is a losing case but I get why Biden's administration is doing the song and dance.  Pretending to care is a lot easier than doing things to actually help minority communities.",
                "You know how you hear a lot of \"make the rich pay their fair share\"? Well, legacy admissions are it. Those legacy admits are the ones who are paying for tuition and improvements so you don't have to. There's a reason the vast majority of those going to Ivy League schools don't pay tuition. And there's a reason why you go to fucking prison if you try to lowball bribe these schools. Either you pay top dollar for your less-than-stellar kid to give them a better shot, or they need to git gud like all the other students.",
                "I am not sure where this will go, but the optics alone might be enough for colleges to give up on legacy admissions.\n\nI have always believed that colleges only valued affirmative action as a distraction to lure public attention away from legacy admissions.",
                "Great news. An equal playing field means an equal playing field, both regarding affirmative action and otherwise. Frankly, if colleges were serious about improving their diversity, they would've done this long ago. For historical reasons, minorities often have lower generational wealth. Ending it would also cut out the box-checking where colleges treat a son of a senator or a person from a country without the racial history we have as if (s)he had a worse hand in life than for instance, someone who grew up in poverty without water or electricity in rural Appalachia, simply because the former examples are a certain race. That legal regime has always been detrimental to creating true equality.",
                "So quick run down \n\n1) Harvard bites itself in their legacy admissions as a defense to why they can\u2019t do anything else. Prima facie only goes so far with disparate. \n\n2) the feds win. But then lose. Because Harvard is better off with the donations than students who can\u2019t afford to get in federal loans. They will make the same from only certain students, make more from donors, and simply pay a small loss for the students who otherwise used the loans. The feds lose all say suddenly. No change for Harvard really.",
                "This is long overdue.",
                "lol, it's a private institution which allows preference for family members of alumni, same as every other school.  I bet Harvard is actually leading the charge on this story.",
                "Good.  End them.  No sense giving additional advantages to the rich.",
                "It's inarguable that legacy admissions were instituted as a technique to keep Jews and other such undesirables out of places like the Ivy League. Likewise, we know that such legacy preferences primarily serve to preserve elite status across generations.\n\nAnd if we're talking about public universities, this would be intolerable. Public universities have a mission to educate the public, regardless of who their parents were. While legacy admissions might have a positive relation to alumni donations, they still don't fit with the mission of such universities.\n\nHowever, when you're talking about elite private schools, the issue becomes a bit more complex.\n\nThe value of a Harvard education is not in the classroom. If anything, Harvard is a far less rigorous education than you'd expect given the qualifications expected. The value of a Harvard education is that you'll be associating with the children of those elites. People who can open doors for you that your own parents cannot.\n\nWe know what a university where merit is everything looks like. It looks like CalTech. Everyone is stupendously intelligent and expected to perform at the highest possible level. Coursework is brutally difficult, covering more ground in a month than a Harvard course would cover all semester long.\n\nAnd the students? Their expectation is not to go to white shoe law firms or getting a cozy corner office. It's to make their way in the world purely on the weight of their sheer intellect.\n\nThat's a tough road to walk. It's akin to expecting to make a living in the NBA. Very few people are cut out to perform at that level and most who think they can, can't.\n\nIt's a hell of a lot easier to schmooze your way to a comfy life. Harvard offers that precisely because it *doesn't* function off of pure merit. It mixes those who deserve a place at the table with those who already have one. That's the valuable service it provides it and it can't provide it if you make into CalTech-on-the-Charles.\n\nIs it fair that the lesser intellects of the world can inherit privilege from their parents? I suppose not. But that's reality. There aren't any societies where this doesn't occur. So the real question is whether you want a society where some of the next generation of elites are born into it - or where all of the next generation of elites are."

                "The title implies there was ever a time when \"society\" cared about \"facts and truth\" and interrogating narratives. I'll define caring about facts and truth as employing epistemological methods and effective skepticism. I'll define \"society\" as a critical mass of the intelligentsia and ordinary people.\n\nIf the definitions are accurate, then this argument harkens back to a false past. Outside of academia and journalism, people base their worldview on the words of authorities they respect, rare hard won lessons of personal experience, or ideas they've heard repeated from several seemingly disparate sources. They employ heuristics, not formal methods. They engage in rationalizing, not truth-seeking. Tabloids have been extremely popular for centuries. There's no \"relearning\" to be done because interrogation of belief systems has always been the purview of only a narrow slice of society. This is the small number of people possess the natural disposition, special training, and energy to properly interrogate.\n\nThat said, I would love to see the improvement of primary and secondary education in this area, and humanity can only benefit from the investment.\n\nEdit: to be clear, I don't intend to lionize the intellectual class. Most academics and journalists think heuristically almost all the time as well, except maybe within their narrow area of expertise. It's simply the case that truth-seeking done right is exceptionally difficult.",

                "While the neglect of education and of critical thinking are important issues, the contemporary lack of respect for facts and truth stem first from the desire of people to do whatever they want unempeded, especially in politics.\n\nPeople vying for power or those with power, whether in labor or socially, hate others questioning them and trying to limit their power grabs, with reason and logic. Just look at Brexit and how it demonised specialists.\n\nThis is compounded by the fact that we've created a very comfortable world, where bad choices create results from which especially those in power are well insulated from. Mad Cow disease originated from the political move to make everything profitable in Britain during Margaret Tatcher's mandate as Prime Minister, and was covered up by sucessive british governments, people died horribly and nobody in politics went to jailed for it, and especially not Margaret Tatcher.\n\nWhat is at the root of the lack of respect for facts and truth is pure selfishness: \"I want to do what I want to do and, if you are against, your opinion means nothing to me\". It's a story as old as Humanity. Just look at the recent tragedy with the sub near the Titanic.\n\nAnd the underfunding of non-STEM courses is also because of that. Leaders want followers, not people with independent thought they have trouble profiting from. And universities are all for their monies.\n\nRepublicans in some states are even trying to limit and choose teachers and try to get universities under their grip, as they see them as hotspots for liberals and their ideas.",

                "I thought the video of Trudeau talking one-on-one with a Muslim parent in Calgary was quite good. He's basically upholding the small-l liberal principle of [neutrality with respect to values](https://www.mcgill.ca/maxbellschool/files/maxbellschool/myth_of_shared_values_joe_heath.pdf) (including culture and religion), which protects both the LGBT and Muslim communities. Honestly, I think that worldwide, Canada is the country which adheres most rigorously and [most successfully](https://induecourse.utoronto.ca/canadian-exceptionalism/) to this principle.\n\n[Someone posted the video on Twitter](https://twitter.com/d0j0h/status/1679506839237545984), commenting:\n\n> I have never heard a more coherent, clear-eyed, unequivocal, honest, or compelling speech by PM Trudeau than this. This is what all of us should expect from every Canadian politician and public servant. It gets better and better the longer he speaks.",
                ">\u201cFirst of all, there is an awful lot of misinformation and disinformation out there. People on social media, particularly fuelled by the American right-wing, are spreading a lot of untruths about what\u2019s actually in the provincial curriculums.  \n\u201cNow if you look at the various curriculums, you\u2019ll see that there is not what is being said out there about aggressive teaching or conversion of kids to being LGBT. That is something that is being weaponized by people who are not doing it because of their interest in supporting the Muslim community.  \n\u201cThese are people on the far right who have consistently stood against Muslim rights and the Muslim community, but they are weaponizing the issue of LGBT, which is something that, yes, Islam has strong opinions on, the same way that the religious right in Canada, the Christian right, has strong opinions against as well.\u201d\n\nWhat part of this is wrong? You could make the argument that he is downplaying religious intolerance of LGBT rights by merely stating that Islam \"has strong opinions\" rather than outright stating that Islamic beliefs are hostile to the LGBT community. But everything else is absolutely correct.\n\nThe right wing, especially in the United States, is obsessed with weaponizing hatred against the LGB and particularly T community as they see that as the path to electoral victory (easier than actually coming up with policies that might be even remotely popular). And the lies that fuel that hatred and bigotry are imported into this country through social media.\n\nCanadians are not blameless by any means. We have our own home-grown heroes of hate like Jordan Peterson.",
                "Nowhere in that article does he say that. He talks about how there's a lot of misinformation about gender identity and sexual orientation on the internet, fuelled by the far right, not that the entirety of all Muslim parents are 'mislead' by them.

                "The headline is misleading, as it's only a partial truth. Trudeau's actual comment is pretty solid and truthful.\n\nThere are certainly traditional/religious based views that are already pre-existing that isn't being caused by the \"far right\". Trudeau even alludes to this in his statement. \n\nBut the far right are certainly pushing the agenda that it is all woke activism and that the education system is pushing children to be part of the Alphabet Mafia (Or Alpha Numeric Mafia now that 2S is specifically acknowledged).\n\nStoking the hate of a particular religion/culture just to further your political influence is gross, and that's definitely what the far right is doing. Go to any big blockbuster post, and you'll need a few hands to count all the \"woke\"/\"remember when we used to be able to tell jokes?\" crowd that is proof of the people these political systems are pandering to.\n\nI don't like the extremes of both sides, obviously, but the extreme left is policing people on their intolerance of diversity, the extreme right is policing people on the right to express themselves. One side I personally see as the \"better\" option, but what side I'm on will always flip flop depending on topic.\n\nFor example: I game with a middle aged woman who has kids in the low grades (I think Grade 4 or 5?). Their school was celebrating trans pride, and was making the kids learn about it their. Not to push anything on the kids, but to give them an idea of why people will transition in case they come across trans people in the future (or perhaps are one, but don't know it). My friend was bothered by this, as she believed that it's something her kids should learn on their own, or by people they know. She had nothing against trans people, and she's against the hate they get, but she didn't believe that her school should be having their own trans \"parade\", and wearing matching shirts, when the school was full of kids who hadn't even reached sexual maturity.\n\nMy stance was kids should learn about trans people and the 5 W's. Doing it through school is more neutral than through family, as families can be very biased depending on their beliefs. I can see why my friend was bothered though, as the school had already celebrated a pride themed event, which she also felt the trans pride could have been folded into. I agree with that part, because I don't believe in the splintering of minority groups. Pride is seen by most people as the \"gay\" event. It's not, obviously, but that's what common public perception currently is. Most people support Pride, which is great! But now we splinter into the individual categories within that umbrella, and we get more issues. Uncle Hank can support price because \"I don't have any problem with them\", but if now we are celebrating Trans + Pride, Uncle Hank might drop support of Trans people because \"it ain't natural\". This also sows more annoyance/negativity towards both groups because people are tired of \"celebrating\" things.\n\nWhere was I going with this? Lmao",

And in NSW, the yes vote was ahead of the no vote at 45/42.\r  \n\r  \nBroken down to household incomes, it shows those earning more than $150,000 a year were the strongest proponents of the voice with 48 per cent in favour and 43 per cent against.\r  \n\r  \nSupport fell away the lower the household income, with 46 per cent of those on incomes of $100,000 and $149,000 in favour and 44 per cent opposed.\r  \n\r  \nSentiment then swung the other way for those with household incomes of between $50,000 and $99,000, with 47 per cent supporting a no vote and 44 per cent intending to vote yes.\r  \n\r  \nStrongest opposition to the voice was among low-income households with 54 per cent of those under $50,000 a year opposed compared to just 36 per cent in favour.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, the strong no vote in this demographic was comprised mainly of retirees.\r  \n\r  \nThose low-income households who were not retirees were more likely to be in favour of the voice.\r  \n\r  \nMen were also significantly more inclined to vote no \u2013 49 per cent to 42 per cent.\r  \n\r  \nDespite an increase in opposition to the voice among women in the most recent Newspoll, when averaged over the quarter, female voters were evenly split at 44/44.\r  \n\r  \nThere were also stark divisions based on people\u2019s housing circumstances.\r  \n\r  \nRenters were more likely to vote yes \u2013 51/37 \u2013 compared to those with a mortgage who were more inclined to vote no \u2013 45/43.\r  \n\r  \nThis was a construct of the age demographic with younger voters more likely to be renting.\r  \n\r  \nA majority of people who owned their home outright, however, and consistent with older demographics, were against the voice \u2013 58/34.\r  \n\r  \nSupport among those with university degrees was highest - 55/37 \u2013 while those without any qualifications were against at 51/37.\r  \n\r  \nThe highest level of support was among 18-34 year olds with 62 per cent saying they would vote yes compared to 27 per cent behind the no case.

I have the Ausbildung as a Pharmaceutical technician and I also studied Medical engineering at University.

I told them the truth that i had been obsessed with getting rich since I was like 15 years old and had read everything available and that i liked math. They thought it was all funny and cool. They gave me an internship as the direct intern of the VP they did ended up  hiring. Over the course of six months I used regression analysis and mathematical modeling to build a grading system for mutual fund managers that they still use today. I eventually chose not to stay in finance but it was quite a fun time. They thought i was brilliant, but i\u2019m not really i just happen to be obsessed with that subject for a period in my life.

            "selftext": "Remember when Homer Simpson could get a job at a nuclear plant and find himself and his family comfortably seated in the American middle class? Or how about The Brady Bunch? A normal American family with one man supporting all the kids. What a shame that average joes can\u2019t live that life anymore.\n\nHere's a link to the relevant post: https://np.reddit.com/r/facepalm/comments/15ghog1/the_american_dream_is_dead/\n\nMarginally snarkier blog version available [here.](https://jackthoughts.substack.com/p/no-it-was-never-normal-for-one-person)\n\n> I feel the need to explain something to the generation that does not remember, or never saw, a world where one person with a high school education could support a family of 5 comfortably. \n\n> This was real. For millions of US families. It was \\*normal.*\n\n> It was stolen from you.\n\nR1: I don\u2019t think 90% of the people reading this need it to be shown to them that this idea of American history is wrong, but apparently, thousands of people spending their time on Reddit think it's right, so let\u2019s dive in. For the purposes of this post, I\u2019m going to assume that \u201cnormal\u201d means occurring at or close to the median for continuous variables like income, or in other cases where the variable in question is discontinuous, occurring for a plurality of Americans.\n\nIncidentally, this idea of American life was directly contradicted in a paper I read for a class I took on poverty in America during my last semester of college. The relevant excerpt from [this paper](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/000271620157700102), written by historian Linda Gordon, says \u201cthere was never a time in U.S. history when the majority of men were able to support a wife and children single-handedly.\u201d This statement cites three sources, but all of them were written pre-Great Depression, and usually, it\u2019s the time spanning from 1945 to the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 that people fawn over, so I\u2019m going to look elsewhere for more information.\n\nFirst, take a look at [the real median personal income in the US](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MEPAINUSA672N), a measure of the income received by the middle American if you line everyone up in order of income, adjusted for changes in the average price level over time. This contradicts the narrative in the post: albeit with busts and booms, the \u201cnormal\u201d American has been making more and more money since 1974, the earliest year recorded in the chart, adjusted for purchasing power. Even if there was a time when the typical American with a high school education could support a family of five with just their income and a handy housewife, that same American can now make even more money in the modern day\u2026assuming they\u2019re willing to (potentially) get a college degree, depending on the industry they go into. This chart doesn\u2019t look exclusively at people with only a high school education, and I\u2019m guessing you\u2019ve heard about the [growing income gap between people with and without a college degree.](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2014/02/11/the-rising-cost-of-not-going-to-college/) It already seems doubtful that it's gotten harder for the typical American to pull off the lifestyle described in the linked post, but we're going to have to look elsewhere for data specifically on the earnings of those with just a high school education.\n\nThe St. Louis Fed has [data on this](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LEU0252917300A) going back to 1979. Between then and 2022, median nominal earnings among those with a high school education and no college degree have grown by about 242.6%, while the [price level as measured by the CPI](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CPIAUCSL#0) has grown by about 303.14%. Looks like we can no longer dismiss this particular single-earner idea out of hand: wages haven't kept pace with prices for those without a college degree.\n\nNot so fast. If you took a macro class and remember its content well, you'll know the CPI has its flaws. For one, it's calculated without adjusting for substitutions made by consumers. That's not the case for the PCE index, which we can apply directly to our data thanks to the magic of FRED. For simplicity's sake, I've indexed both earnings and the PCE to 1979 and divided the earnings index by the price index to show the change in real earnings in a way that can be easily understood in percentage terms. If earnings kept pace with prices exactly, the formula would just yield 100/100 = 1 for the final date. If they fell behind prices, we'd get a fraction less than one. [What do we see instead?](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=17yqB)\n\nThe median worker with only a high school education earned about 3.663% more in 2022 than in 1979. There have clearly been some rough times for this sort of person, but at the very least this data doesn't describe a downward trend.*\n\n*(EDIT: There's an important point to attach to this, which I was made aware of thanks to /u/pepin-lebref : [Wages are down for men without a college education, relative to 1979.](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=17yTL) This implies that the small bump observed above is due to increases in earnings among women. And to be a total pedant, yes, there are more than two genders, and no, that doesn't really affect the conclusion here. The important thing is that this part of the R1 was sort of wrong because it is harder for men, in particular, to pull off the single-earner lifestyle described in the tweet in 2022 compared to 1979.)\n\nBut let's focus on the point: was there ever a time when it was normal for a single earner to comfortably support a family of five with just a high school education? To our misfortune, there isn't a dataset looking specifically at the earnings of those with only a high school education adjusted for the cost of supporting a family of five over time. Putting together that data for every single year on record would be very time-consuming, so I\u2019ll focus on 1979 before doing anything else.\n\nThe nominal median weekly wage in this data, in 1979, was $249. With one week of vacation time, that translates to $12,699 a year, but I\u2019ll steelman the opposing idea a little and go with the 52-week figure of $12,948. Now all we need is the typical cost of living for a family of five in 1979. This kind of data is surprisingly hard to find, but I did find [data from the BLS](https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2001/05/art3full.pdf) that includes the median nominal cost of living for a family of four in 1979. This measure includes the cost of entertainment, but I think it's fair to interpret \"comfortably\" as meaning \"with a reasonable amount of money spent on leisure, for the time.\" That comes out to $16,129, exceeding the calculated median salary.\n\nSo no, it looks like it wasn\u2019t normal for a single high school graduate to provide a comfortable standard of living to a family of five in 1979. The trouble here is that we can\u2019t be sure the median earner with a high school education was both 1. making the same amount of money as the median earner with a high school education and two kids to take care of and 2. paying for the same basket of goods. But we\u2019d have to make some great leaps from our limited data to assume it was really typical for one high school graduate to take care of a family of five comfortably: the budget we found was about 24.6% higher than the calculated salary, and we\u2019re talking about somebody with three kids to take care of, not the two kids in the four-person family this budget was calculated for. Unless someone else responds to this with better (and contradictory) data, we should be able to reject the idea in the post I linked with a fair amount of certainty.\n\nBut maybe we just need to look further back. 1979 wasn\u2019t that long ago, and as we all know, [everything started to get worse before then, in 1971.](https://wtfhappenedin1971.com/) (Note for if you're just visiting the lands of BE: that site is fairly well known here for being very wrong about everything.) How about 1960?\n\nI don't have the data to provide a clear picture of that time, but I do have [data on the prevalence of single-earner married-couple households in the US going back to 1967](https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2014/ted_20140602.htm). (Props to /u/BernankesBeard for sharing a link to this data with me.) Back then, only about 35.6% of married-couple families had just the husband working, while 43.6% of them had both the husband and wife working. Just as described by Linda Gordon, the single-earner picture of families in the US doesn't accurately characterize the 60s (or at least the late 60s).\n\nNothing that I have shared here directly contradicts the idea that it used to be normal for a high school graduate in the US to support a family of five comfortably without anyone else bringing in income. And you might extrapolate backward from that BLS data on married-couple families to conclude it used to be normal for the husband to be the only worker. But even then, which type of family do you think tended to have three kids more often: the one with just one earner, or the one with multiple? It\u2019s more likely that the three-child households in this data were concentrated among two-earner households, meaning it wasn't \"normal\" for a single earner to support a family of five back then. More likely, it was normal for two earners to support a family of five, because families with more kids need more money for them to be fed and clothed.\n\nLimitations aside, it isn\u2019t reasonable to look at the data we have and come to the conclusion that the idyllic economy the denizens of /r/facepalm wish they had used to be real in the United States. You have to make a lot of big assumptions to reach that conclusion:\n\n1. Single-earner households were more common before 1967 than during that time, AND\n2. A significant number of those households had three or more kids, AND\n3. The earners in those households made more money than suggested by the data, AND/OR\n4. A five-person household's budget would have been less expensive than suggested by the data, OR\n5. The data is fabricated by THEM\n\nAssumption 5 is my personal favorite. I wouldn't call this post conclusive, but until we get a better one, maybe we should stop getting so nostalgic for a time that, by all that we can tell, really didn't exist.",

However, they also have more childcare expenses. So the value of stay-at-home work is also higher. I don't think it's clear which way this would actually go.",

Up until 11th  grade, the teachers I had in my various classes simply did not give a fuck. They were tenured lifers that didn't engage in class. They assigned reading and questions and homework. I didn't do the homework and barely answered the questions. My teachers didn't care, and I knew it. I f they didn't care, why should I. \nThat changed in my last two years. The teachers were passionate, engaged the class, and I knew they cared. And because they cared, I put effort in, and got Honor Roll my last two years. \nI was, and still am, an avid reader. In Elementary school, I was part of a weekly reader program. My mother brought me out every weekend to buy a book.   \nWhen I was around 15, my first fantasy series I read was The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant. I devoured those.

Schools certainly need more resources to actually teach without having a single book for an entire grade (we couldn't take our U.S. History books home or even out of the class -- we had to hopefully take good enough notes to pass).\n\nThat being said, how exactly can parents be involved when they're typically working the standard 8-hour-5-day working schedule? In most places a double income is needed for just housing and the average American is one emergency away from going broke so how can both parents be involved when they're out of the house usually for longer than an average school day? People just can't up and move if they're already worrying about whether they have enough money to get by where they're currently at and if enough people move to the rural areas the prices of those places increase thereby transferring the problem to there. And unfortunately not everybody can have those high-earning positions otherwise those job markets get saturated and pay decreases (somebody has to work those lower-end jobs that people love to diss). Thus, how can parents be involved in anything other than on-the-surface education when they have to spend more time making sure the children have a roof over their head?\n\nMore money may or may not help but I can tell you that this is a symptom of the problem and not the problem itself. Maybe if wages increased with inflation and a family could go back to living comfortably on a single income that another parent could manage the schooling. And postsecondary education could be affordable enough that someone working a part-time job could pay for schooling without needing loans (parents generally can't teach what they don't know so...).

Furthermore, due to budget cuts (despite lots of education heads making upwards of 6 figures), children who need extra support (learning disabilities, neurodivergent, trauma, etc.) have their dedicated classes and resources cut under the disingenuous label of \"diversity/inclusivity\", which means that teachers have to do 10x more work and aren't adequately set up to succeed, which impacts how much children can succeed as well.\n\nAnd how do you expect parents to be more involved exactly, when we have a socioeconomic system set up where it's impossible to do so? Parents are working longer and harder and making less money than generations before them, and resources available to help kids are few and far between. Parents barely have enough time or emotional/mental energy to be present with their kid, let alone act as a homework tool to reinforce their education.\n\nThe situation is complex, but I guarantee you the solution is not just \"parents just need to work harder.\"",

                "Teachers have probably the most important job in our society. They deserve more pay just for that reason alone, but more money in education means more resources that can be used to teach kids. This additional money doesn't necessarily help the kids that are pretty much a lost cause, but it can. However, this money substantially helps the average student by providing a better teacher to student ratio, or allowing the school to purchase better resources, allowing more advanced classes like engineering/software. You'd have a point if all the extra money was going toward fixing bad parenting, but I doubt much, if any, of the money is going toward that. Most of it likely goes to resources/activities/classes\n\nI'd bet that you wouldn't be able to effectively teach all of these to your children:\n\nPhysics, chemistry, calculus, differential equations, biology, biochemistry, anatomy, physiology, psychology, geology, astronomy, geography, American history, European history, world history, English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, etc. \n\nYou might be able to teach some subjects, but not all. They usually need someone who specializes in those subjects to teach them. More money, more specialists that can be hired. More money means more money can be allotted to different/new classes. In order for a parent to take the place of teachers, they'd not only need to have a solid understanding of whatever the general education is, but also have the time and money to spend on their children. That's not something every parent has. Some parents didn't get past middle school. Some can't read. Some have to work two jobs to afford to keep a roof over their kids' heads.\n\nExpecting every parent to be better is vastly more complicated than giving education more funding, and also less feasible.

                "Ok so this is what I don't understand. \n\nWe all know this happens, many parents don't teach and/or prepare their children for school. In turn these unprepared children that don't receive the educational attention they need at home must try to make up for it through public school. That means more in class resources and attention must be dedicated to those students. This is how averages bring the entire class down. In terms of performance, some kids are brought up to the standard but in doing so, the attention brighter students need is unavailable and their potential is diminished. \n\nNow let's say you are one of those parents that does put tremendous effort in ensuring your child has the best headstart to school, you spend the time to prepare them and you recognize you've got a bright child. Wouldn't you be apprehensive about placing your child in a school that prioritizes catching up the bottom performant students instead of elevating the top students (the students whose parents also prepared them). \n\nThis is why I don't understand how a parent can be against quality private schools. A bad private school is one that doesn't meet specific objects but all public schools have to operate by catering to the lowest common denominator because of how they are funded and regulated. The parents I've talked to want to take a macro perspective approach and argue how all kids should go through public school so it's \"fair for all\" or some such nonsense but as long as parents don't take an interest in their child's education it will never be fair and I refuse to sacrifice my child's education at the alter of \"fairness\" for fairness' sake.

Consider as well, however:\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f Over time and endless, endless exposure, feminists develop skill at spotting trolls and incels and other chucklefucks from word one and stop wasting precious energy and time on them, moving directly to hostilities, because trolls and other bullies respond only to 1) superior force (wit or numbers) and 2) public shaming. \n\nEach person has to make an individual judgment about when to employ the rhetorical tactic of gently educating vs. burning someone's soul out of them with words. Some feminists' thresholds for making that call are lower than others'.\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f Diversity of tone and message across multiple answers from multiple sources is valuable information to a questioner. Different feminists answer questions differently based on their experiences, education, background, readings, etc. I answer some questions with snark and some with statistics and some with personal accounts and some with support. Other feminists do the same.\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f Sometimes an answer is addressed to one person but aimed at others. There are times when a writer wants to show everyone reading that saying some things gets you a loud and angry response.\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f Antifeminist questions and arguments often boil down to \"Why shouldn't the state/the dominant culture/'nature'/men get to choose for women what women do with their lives and work and bodies?\" _People get to be mad about questions like this._ Especially the people whose lives and safety and freedom and bodies are on the line. \n\nPeople get to be mad at the person asking those questions, _even when they are asked in good faith and genuine ignorance_. It is okay, it is useful sometimes, to show people that their ignorance harms and that the people it harms are not happy about that.",

Bc I've already made up my mind not to be racist. My first instinct is to question my own words.

                "I actually agree with this one.\n\nAnd with feminism suuuuper under attack right now, I think it would go a long way to take a step back when someone asks a question (yes, even the \"stupid\" ones lol) and give a thoughtful answer.\n\nFeminists aren't the reason women's rights are under attack literally everywhere, but they could do a lot in turning it around. Putting crap aside and engaging with questions respectfully would go a long way, even when the question itself is kind of proof how bad sexism is, and even when others aren't being the most respectful in the world, although I would leave that up to each individual and the circumstance. But kind of rising above those situations and just answering in good faith would be helpful to the cause.\n\nPlus, when people look through these threads as some sort of study of feminism, and you know they will, do you want them to see a bunch of feminists answering people's questions and trying to cultivate an environment of respect and education? Or do want them to see a bunch of feminists jumping all over people who come in here, kind of proving their point. Of course, this the internet, you can't blame people here for doing what they do everywhere on the internet \ud83d\ude02 but you know they'll find a way to blame women and feminism for this one too lol\n\nAnyway, if the goal is a future of mutual respect and equality, I think educating people gently is a good part of that as the OP suggested, and that r/AskFeminists could be a good place for that if people have a mind to help out.\n\nThat's not to say people don't have good reasons to be upset or fatigued or even want to \"berate\" some of the things people say on here. And maybe there's a time and a place for that, I don't know, but maybe the overall effort here should be in the spirit of education, understanding and taking most questions in good faith. Even if they're not, there's a case to be made for answering lousy questions in good faith anyway, because others may read who genuinely want to hear the answers and may get turned off by feminism if they think feminists are people who attack people for asking questions.\n\nOnce in a while, I do see an example not worth validating in the slightest obviously, lol. We're all familiar with true misogyny and some pretty dark stuff. I don't know for sure what the best way to deal with those situations is. However, I don't find most questions here to be at that level. A lot more good would come from engaging than berating.\n\nThen again, I know not everyone wants comments to be as long as this one \ud83d\ude02 could still answer thoughtfully while being more concise though.\n\n**EDIT - I totally agree with shaming people too as the other comments suggest. From a feminist perspective, complaints around \"Cancel Culture\" was totally to disempower women, the LGBT community and racial minorities** from being able to stand up against bigotry while they cleared a path for \"anti-woke\" ideology if that means anything to you. **My point is,** r/AskFeminists **might be a better place for tackling issues through education and dialogue when people are asking questions, and shame may be better in other circumstances.** You can think of it as a \"safe space\" for people who nothing about feminism and may even be a little sexist \ud83d\ude02 but that dialogue might be good for everyone anyways.\n\nThanks for sharing \ud83d\udc4d",

If you would like to opt out of IDR forgiveness for any reason, contact your loan servicer no later than 08/13/2023 and tell them that you are not interested in receiving IDR forgiveness. Some reasons why you might want to consider opting out include concerns about a potential state tax liability.  \nIf you decide to opt out of IDR forgiveness, you will be expected to continue paying your loan(s) once the student loan payment pause ends.  \n   \n\t  \nLoan Servicer Information  \nDon't know who your loan servicer is?

How do we turn the profession around and keep it from digging it's own grave with poor academic rigor, inferior diagnostic training, and little expectation of basic skills? There are a lot of great NPs out there who have supplemented their learning and pushed themselves to become great providers to their patients, despite the poor curriculum.

                "I am currently working on a policy based DNP project on NP education reform and have gone back and forth on a lot of this. I've spoken with accreditors and policy researchers and I've noticed a striking difference in the attitudes of the old guard vs. the new guard. \n\nSo many of the people in charge of accreditation and higher ed programs ( CCNE and AACN committees are comprised of educators from all over) are stuck in the battles that happened in the 80s and 90s, where nurses were fighting hard for the advanced practice roles we've come to take for granted.  \n\nNurses do so much in this country, more than basically anywhere else in the world. It's because of the old guard's stubborn fighting for these roles. But this mindset and these sensibilities have left older educators vulnerable to greedy online education programs. There's moderate to intense tribalism. \"NPs have been proven to be safe and effective\" doesn't make any sense in a system allowing direct entry/minimal experience, and completely lacking standardization. \n\n\nIf anyone else is passionate about this or are working on projects of their own, and want to have monthly zoom meetings or start any sort of network, feel free to PM!  I've become convinced that the way towards change involves NPs and nurses, NOT MDs (who are often most aggravated by this) going directly to the board of education and legislators and operating levers at this level that force the hands of Accreditors to really consider things like  limiting online school class sizes until they can prove they're providing adequate clinical training (instead of running on the honor system), requiring harder boards that schools will then have to actually teach to, and upping years of nursing practice experience.\n\nMargaret Meade, anyone?\n\"Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful committed individuals can change the world.

                "Higher admissions standards, vetted clinical placement sites, WAY more clinical hours, previous RN experience.\n\nI'm embarrassed to admit this, but I was a direct-entry psych NP student way back in 2004. I had a non-nursing bachelor's degree, so I completed my RN degree and then went straight into the NP program. I only worked as an RN while I was waiting to take my NP boards. It terrifies me that I then went into practice as an NP. Thank God, I first worked with a psychiatrist who provided great supervision, hands-on training, and he taught me most of what I know. I think I'm very good at my job now, but that's in spite of my education.\n\nThe only thing worth saving from the direct-entry program was the admissions--it was very competitive.\n\nI love that you're asking this question, OP. We all lament over the state of the profession; would love to take action to fix it. I think the certification organizations would have to get on board in order for there to be any real changes, but they profit when there are more NPs, so it would be an uphill battle.",

                "I am in this on year 28. I\u2019m dual certified: Whnp-bc and FNP-c .  I absolutely agree that the education has been dumbed down.    I\u2019ve gone both routes.   The traditional brick and mortar and for kicks and giggles and a free education benefit  I did an Fnp program which was on line.   \n\nMore clinical hours are absolutely necessary prior to entry to practice. Not to go all \u201cback in the day\u201d on you but back in the day it was 2.5 years to get through the didactic plus 2000( yes two thousand) clinical hours!  Then you worked as a graduate nurse practitioner until you could sit your boards.  The opportunity for that came up twice a year.    I can\u2019t be positive but there may have even been a requirement of a certain number of Graduates NP hours required to be eligible to sit the test.  \nI also had to take the gre to even apply and needed to go to community college to take statistics prior to even being eligible to apply to the program.   \nObviously this was pre internet so my program was part of a large university hospital system.    Clinical we\u2019re arranged by the school with specific goals to match the curriculum.   Clinical instructors showed up at planned and random intervals to assess progress and communicate goals with clinical preceptors\u2026.we presented prepared cases in class a la m&m style.    There were no easy answers.   If you didn\u2019t know something you had to look it up and probably even had to read more than one sentence to get your answer.   \n\nThe family np program was on line but associated with a university hospital system.  It took a year and maybe 500 clinical hours.    The 500 could easily be an overstatement.    I\u2019m not sure.    I communicated with my peers on \u201cblackboard \u201c.   Mothers in real time.  My clinical instructor never made an appearance but I think she called once.   It was so easy. I was able to work full time and raise 3 kids while doing it.      I had the \u201cbenefit\u201d of the internet.  \n\nNow I precept regularly.    I think the maximum hours of a clinical rotation has been 200.  The minimum has been 90.    I have yet to see a university professor on site.  If there is a call it is usually just that.  A call\u2026 not even a zoom.    The call takes maybe 3 minutes and involves questions about timelines and parking?! Never have specific goals for skill sets been laid out for me.  It always a struggle getting a university associated professor to call back and they are usually quite defensive of their students.  I require a goal per day of my students\u2026. In writing!    A funny answer on day 1 of a first rotation was \u201c I want to put in an iud today \u201c.    We settled on learning what an iud was and how to find a uterus.    \n(Pretty sure finding the uterus was unsuccessful).   \nMy current student is on her final rotation.  I asked her on week two for her differential diagnoses\u2026 she didn\u2019t know what that meant and couldn\u2019t come up with anything.     She actually told me no one had ever discussed this with her before.    A call to the university professor ended with the university suggesting that a student making differentials was a \u201c lofty goal\u201d.    \nAgain and again I see students who are unable to transition from nurse to nurse practitioner.   By this I mean I have had plenty of students that can collect a great history and do an adequate exam but they have no idea what to do with their data.   \nAnd writing?   Omg.    Artificial intelligence this year has made many shine on paper but in clinic getting a thought on paper is agonizing . \n\nSo the up shot of this rant is this:  many many many more clinical hours and much much much more integration of university staff within the clinical setting.    \n\nThis is medicine. This is nursing.   This is important and has life changing consequences.     Urgent change is essential.",

I was a RN for 18 years working acute care,outpatient care, office ,hospital admin before I felt like I had a rounded mind to go to NP school and I do feel that we should get back to some standards of multiple practice years before you can enter NP school.  Part of the reason that NP school is so much more abbreviated than PA school is because there's an unspoken expectation that as a nurse you hold the knowledge base necessary to become a good NP with only 2 years of school",

While I acknowledge being a nurse is way different than a provider, I do take away some knowledge and value to the 8 years of practice in my specialty that I had prior to becoming an NP. I also agree with way more clinical hours or even completion of a fellowship program is nice because then it's 1 hospital/unit and not multiple different ones.",
                "A lot of the science classes they require in med school are \"prestige science\", they do not help clinically.  They help if you want to research or forge new paths. Being able to understand what other people have done well enough is more than sufficient.  \n\n*More* specialization.  I know this goes in contrast to what someone else has said below, but I look at it as one of the reasons we are able to shorten the educational time is because we *can't* practice anywhere willy-nilly.  Residents spend most of the year in clinical fields that they will never practice in, which is a waste, IMO.  When you specialize and focus, you can really concentrate on what you actually need to know to be a good clinician.  NNPs have shown that consistently, IMO.\n\nRequiring experience in the field you want to work in.  Simply for assessment purposes if nothing else.  I was a direct-entry student, but I still went to work for 4 years prior to finishing my degree.  Ohio State's DE program encourages you to work before starting any sort of clinical work as an NP. \n\nMore clinical hours.  I know I did extra, but there should be more required hours, and high quality hours.  \n\nStop focusing on \"full practice authority\" upon licensure.  When you graduate as an NP, you are a *novice* again.  Independence shouldn't even be considered until 5-10 years of supervised work and collaboration.  And not just signing off charts mindlessly, true supervision and collaboration.  In the NICU, we're treated like residents to fellows, depending on experience and skill. No one coming out of school should be practicing independently fully.  \n\nRein in the FNP track.  People are using it so they can \"do anything\". That's not what being an NP is about.  You want to \"do anything\", become a doctor.  FNPs try to be jacks of all trades but are masters in none.  The only kind of practice an FNP track really prepares them for is basic preventative/well care.  \n\nLonger orientations for new grads - call it orientation, residency, fellowship, preceptorship or whatever the hell you want, but at *minimum* your first year of practice is essentially like another year of school.  You need *close* supervision and help.  \n\nFocus on healthy collaboration instead of independence.",

The scope is too broad for the education we get. I think the differentiation of the tracks is a strength and the specialized and focused education NPs could receive on their specific patient population could make them stronger and more effective clinicians. For people who want to take care of the whole life span, create bridging programs that provide primary care education and licensure in adults and children.\n5) We should all have 1 year residencies or fellowships in our specialties before we are unleashed on the masses, though this is more likely the responsibilities of the hiring bodies rather than the educational institutions.",

Leveling the playing field will only improve relations and quality patient care.\n\nI wish we would utilize one another to balance our strengths and weaknesses. There are many skills I've become more proficient in because I can rely on the practice of my NP colleagues for guidance and support. It's just a shame it took a good amount of time and trust building to get there because of longstanding internalized stigmas.",
                "I am wondering why NPs are advocating for stricter requirements only after they entered and graduated the program themselves already,  not before admission? If the person really wants to be good provider,  they will study hard,  no matter what program. DNP has a lot of leadership and administrative classes,  but how does it help you to be better clinician?  With nowadays tuition and student loan rates,  who can afford full time on campus DNP program? Sorry,  but these questions need to be answered as well. I think better to advocate for schools to PROVIDE good preceptors,  which will filter out all these diploma mills and help to gain better clinical experience for NP students. NP students are more concerned about finding any kind of perceptor,  than about gaining valued clinical experience.",
                "I agree with all of these suggestions and even NP residencies after graduation.",
                "I am also a new grad getting ready to start my NP career. We need to limit the \u201cnurse-y\u201d fluff and emphasize more hands on, medical, science based information. I spent well over 3+ semesters learning how to write a good paper and know about nursing theory, yet, my actual training on how to be a provider felt minimal. I hate telling my peers and the providers at work that I did not do many hands on procedures in school or clinicals and only got 1 hour of training on reading imaging. While we are still nurses, we also have to think like providers and need to have a better knowledge on pathology, pharmacology, and diagnosis overall. \n\nIf it wasn\u2019t for my preceptors and a select few instructors I feel that I would have extra fancy letters at the end of my name with limited extra knowledge. I did go to an online program, but for a brick and mortar school. We had an immersion weekend and they did offer a \u201cskills\u201d course but the program did not promote it so few in my class got into the course. However, according to my preceptors, even students who go to prestigious big name schools aren\u2019t always well prepared anymore. \n\nI absolutely agree more experience is needed prior to acceptance into schools as well as a more stringent acceptance process. I was initially accepted to a diploma mill program 2 years out of nursing school but withdrew prior to starting because I didn\u2019t want that kind of learning and did more research and did not want that program to be educating me. I then waited another year prior to starting my actual program.  By the time I start my job, I will have 6+ years of experience, in ICU, ED, and a little primary care. I personally don\u2019t feel ready or prepared, but my mentors and coworkers say I am going to be fine. Luckily, my new job knows I am a new grad and has ensured they will be taking extra time to train and orient me to ensure I become a good provider. \n \nMy last preceptor told me they are looking to increase the minimum number of clinical hours allowed to sit for boards, which should help our profession, as me, as well as students I knew were hands on learners who learned the most in clinicals. \n\nI think with increasing the clinical hours, a more stringent admission process and minimal experience, as well as improving the education provided we could be seen as a stronger trained group of professionals. As a group, especially as new providers, if we want a change, we have to help, rather than stand in the back and wait for it to happen on its own.",

                "As a soon to be PA new grad, I\u2019ll chime in with a few quick thoughts. First, I will say most of the NP students I ran into and worked with during clinicals were fantastic NP students and I have no doubt they\u2019ll make for great providers soon. Biggest thing that I think is lacking is simply time. More time in foundational medical sciences and more time in clinical rotations. While I respect that many NP students are working while simultaneously completing their programs, I think making the 2 or 3 year sacrifice on income or tuition benefits to be able to fully dedicate to learning how to be phenomenal NPs would go further than almost anything else. Unfortunately, many NP programs, particularly those that are fully online, are more interested in sustaining and increasing enrollment as opposed to the quality of education you are paying for. Since money talks, I would hope that prospective NP students would strongly consider looking into in-person programs or at least online programs with good track records instead of just jumping through the technical hoops to become and NP. I hope the best for NP education because as much as people will argue the differences, we\u2019re kind of in this boat together.",

Appalling.",

There's no reason someone entering a masters program shouldn't know how to evidence based research. That years worth of work could have been put towards patho, pharm, diagnostic reasoning, assessment, blah blah blah.",
                "Standardization. \n\nGPA requirements are currently all over the place. I\u2019ve seen 2.5 (usually in online diploma mills), and I\u2019ve seen as high as 3.3. The minimum really should be around a 3.0 UNLESS you have years and years of experience/a great resume  to make up for it. My school\u2019s requirement is a 3.0. NPs should be intelligent, studious, and great students similar to doctors and PAs\n\nYears of experience requirements are currently\nAll over the place. I\u2019ve seen no experience requirement(BAD. Shame on direct entry programs), I\u2019ve seen 1, I\u2019ve seen 2. Could be biased of course because I waited two years, but I don\u2019t always agree with those saying you should need a decade plus of experience. PA students never have all that experience going into the program. What they DO have is more clinical hours, which I think is the REAL solution. Being an RN is not the same as being an NP. I\u2019ve actually felt more better prepared working in an internal medicine clinic and sitting in on cases (I work with amazing MDs), than working as a bedside nurse. More relevant clinical hours are what we need. Waiting 7-10+ years, when many people have families, have lost all their study techniques, etc is not the answer to me. The only justification for needing more experience should be if your GPA sucks. My school\u2019s requirement is a year of bedside experience. I wouldn\u2019t be mad if this was boosted to 2, or even 3, but needing much more than that I don\u2019t think is necessary if there\u2019s more clinical hours.\n\nMore rigid entry requirements should be a thing. A strong resume demonstrating academic and career leadership/excellence should boost your application. I was commencement speaker, in my nursing honors program, and I did a ton of research/leadership stuff, charge nurse, etc and I have people in my class that literally haven\u2019t done anything, and they have the same amount of experience as me. We shouldn\u2019t be sitting in the same classroom imo. There needs to be standards. \n\nAnd exclusively online diploma mills should not exist. Hybrid programs are convenient and still fine.\n\nOh, and normalize NP residencies. There\u2019s a couple in my area I will be applying to. I feel like with my \u201climited\u201d RN experience, this is the route I\u2019d like to go. The one I\u2019m going to apply to (that I think I have a good chance of landing due to connections and networking) is a year long. You basically get paid less than a typical entry level NP, but more than an RN, to learn. You rank your top four specialties in terms of what you desire (Ie: IM, FM, Positive health, women\u2019s health, etc) and they rotate you through those. You switch specialities every few months. It\u2019s a year long program. You aren\u2019t guaranteed a job at the end, but you have a year of NP experience under your belt and it makes you more competitive. It also gives you chances to network/possibly be hired by your clinical sites. You attend lectures, you do I believe one big project, etc. I love this, and I wish this were a norm everywhere.",
                "The main reason NP education is lacking is because of residency. Prior Rn experience does not equate to the provider role. It can help in certain fields, but your medsurg/icu experience is very limited in fnp. Medical students don't need prior working experience in other fields before becoming a physician. They have clinicals during school & residency afterwards. As for online vs in-person you have to make the effort either way. For those that say online is easy, well the boards are the same. You either pass or fail. Everyone has different ways of learning.",

It took me a long time to become a NP because how people view these programs. There needs to be a legitimate student application and admission process and programs need to be standardized with an increase in clinical hands on education. We learn how to nurse but as a NP we have to learn the art of medicine. I feel this true of the CRNAs, Specialists, NPs and Midwives. If we are to specialize in fields then the programs should be designed for those programs, and not one size fits all. This is the thing I hear from PAs I work with is how NPs are taking over certain specialties because of specialization. Also, states need to enforce the specialization of NPs. My opinion, you know what they say about opinions, that each state should only allow NPs to practice in their specialty. Example, mental health NPs (many thanks for helping to care for a stigmatized population) should not be practicing Family medicine and vice versa. I see a lot of adult-gero NPs practicing in my area working in urgent cares, but yet they have no formal education with children (an example and not trying to throw shade).\n\nOk I will get off my soapbox, and we may now return to the regular scheduled program.

I am sure this will make the academians quite happy while continuing to bog students down with classes that do not produce better providers.

In contrast, the size of someone\u2019s social network and the frequency of external outings to the cinema or restaurant were not associated with dementia risk reduction.\n\nThe results remained statistically significant even when adjusted for earlier education level, and socioeconomic status.

What about the actual physical size of the schools. They've gotten a lot bigger. The funds for larger facilities and their continued maintenance, especially for sports, has to come from somewhere.\n\nAnd what about college level courses. Many schools today offer AP courses in mathematics, physics, and literature. How many schools in 1960 offered a near complete education in calculus like they do today? Did AP tests even exist in 1960 offering college credit? Today a lot of schools have significantly large departments for the sole purpose of college readiness since most kids eventually go to college, something that was not true in 1960.\n\nPeople can talk about bloat, administration costs, teachers' unions, whatever.

School boards also had to be accountable, or they would be easily replaced. Homemakers had free time to serve on the PTA and observe what was happening in the schools. Since the creation of the Dept. of Education, much of the funding comes from the Federal government with political mandates attached to it. Parents and tax payers are cut out of the equation.

A decade of serious education can return the profit that they are earning at such a young age.\n\nRegular schooling doesn't give back as much as it used to. In the past, people focused on education because it led to good profit. In older generations, getting educated was the only way to uplift the social class. But nowadays, it is not necessary due to new emerging fields and earning avenues.\n\nIt is generally a positive sign for the economy when people explore new avenues for wealth creation.\n\nI am not saying that education is unimportant in any way.

Humans (generally) have desire for fame and recognition - in the 70s that might have been directed by them towards becoming an 'actor' now its merely changed to becoming an 'influencer' which is much easily achievable (because platforms like TikTok, Instagram has democratized creative contents).\n2. We as a society have prescribed negative connotation to 9-5 jobs. Many great things were done in 9-5 jobs, including scientists at ISRO to many doctors working in OPD. 9-5 is not bad, you doing things that you don't want to do is bad.\n3. Except for those with genuine interest in academics or those taking programs directly relevant to what they want to do in life the return on investment for getting an undergraduate degree has significantly reduced. 2 decades ago, an undergrad degree could easily fetch you a job which is NOT true anymore. \n4.

There's no point. If your family is wealthy or own assets, start a business or develop or see the land estate and live a comfortable life, something which most lower and middle class will only be able to dream about.\nEducation is now just a status symbol, not a guarantor for economic upliftment. On the contrary an uneducated person will probably accept his fate and continue living and making the best out of it being carefree whereas an educated person will slog till the end of his life licking boots and learning more and more with the hopes of better quality of life someday.\nThe type of jobs that are available for part time in other developed countries are fought for competitively as full time jobs here which is a huge indicator of our state of affairs.\nWe can keep hyping up our increasing gdp, but nobody is watching the median income\nJust few days back i saw that some govt increased the allowance for MLA's for cars from 15L to 75L ,along with increase in salary as well as accomodation and travel allowance reciting inflation...

While there is a strong survivorship bias built into the inference, people see what they see.\nCompare making six figures and having fans by showcasing clothes, make up, dance, skits, etc. with making the same money after spending 5-7 years in the industry, navigating corporate politics, and toxic coworkers. Gen Z and younger folks due to SM exposure know the etiquette and mannerisms of being on camera. That acts like a plus.",
                "Well many people who are answering this questions are adults.Let a kid answer this question about kids,\n\nSome of my friends don't like studying and generally don't study, they have knowledge in various other things except studies and so they do what humans do best, blame.\n\nThey blame it on the education system, practicality and bring the example of the 1% who didn't study and also don't look at the other 99% who studied ( conformation bias ), example Bill gates, Steve jobs, Andrew tate,etc.\n\nThen there are YouTube channels like valuetainment where they teach about entrepreneurship and they too say education doesn't matter.\n\nSo due to this, these people disregard studies and says how they don't teach you finances, etc and general skills.\n\nIt's true that education might be outdated but it's not like it's completely useless, they teach you many things some genuinely useful and some more useful to specific people.\n\nAnd whether you like it or not, entrepreneurship isn't the coolest thing, entrepreneurs will fail if they don't get other people to work for them.\n\nJobs are a necessary component and these lunatics don't understand that, if many people become entrepreneurs then job is in demand and the person gets more value and hence more money.\n\nAnd half of them don't know why they want to be an entrepreneur, they don't have any good reason they just think it's cool and that's it they don't think of any better reason like freedom, altruism, satisfaction, etc.\n\nAll successful entrepreneurs become successful because they think they have a great idea and wanted to bring it to this world and they brought people together and made it a success and half of their ideas go against the grain, it's unique and one of a kind idea that no one believes in and they make it successful hence it looks cool.\n\nIt isn't cool when you think about the hardships and failures, Steve jobs got fired from his own company and imagine how that would have felt.",

Education is a debt pit too.\n\nThat's why you'll hear educated people often say \"chaiwala/vadapav wala humse jayada kama raha hai\"",

Also, I feel that it's more popular among upper middle class or upper class because they have privileges to drop. Middle class people are still focussing on completing degrees.\nE.g. I found many mom influencers and feel clueless how they get time to catch every moment, while being a mom I can't. It's the privilege they got from having 2-3 house help around but not everyone can afford it. Also the next gen relies more on show off rather than living the moment. That's my take on this . Studies are still important and if a genuine talent rises then there should be no issues. And 9-5 jobs are still running the majority of households.",

It is relatively easy to become Electrician, plumber, carpenter or open up a food cart or take up construction work. Job is almost guranteed. \nEverybody is not privileged to leave home, settle in another city and work a corporate job which pays too little for the hustle.\n\nThe main idea is contribute to the society, earn money and settle with a family.

                "*In case this story gets deleted/removed:*\n\n**AITA for not paying for my daughter's education?**\n\nI have a daughter who is about to start college. She actually got in last year but deferred it by a year. My daughter and I have never had a great relationship. Her mom died shortly after her birth and I became a single dad with her and her older brother. She looks and behaves similarly to her mom who I did not have the best relationship with. Very narcissistic and self absorbed and vain. \n\nWhenever I got her brother anything, she had to one up it, found ways of earning money on the side so she can buy expensive makeup, a laptop etc.\n\nShe got into a really good school and wants to do electrical engineering but I know she used people to get there and optimized her chances by intentionally finding high profile contacts and doing the right extra curricular.\n\nI made it clear a year ago that I would not pay for her to study engineering and she seemed upset at the time when I told her that and seemed to have expected up to that point that I would pay for her college like I did for her brother.\n\nMy son did not get into such a top school but it was still expensive and he went to study business. The reason I paid for it was that he wanted to work for my small business after graduating so I saw it as an investment in my business.\n\nWhile I could afford it for my daughter, I don't feel like she needs it, she got a partial scholarship and can cover the rest with loans and work and has already made plans to do so. I am also saving up for a down payment as my son and his girlfriend are looking to buy a house together. My daughter would not need this as she says she wants to remain single but it she ever changed her mind on that I would do the same for her.\n\nAITA here since I dont see the point if she will not work for the family business?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Even when men work in an otherwise women dominated place, men find themslves driven, internally or externally (usually the latter) towards paths and promotions that pay more, that those systems will soft-lock women out of.   \n\n\nLike, in education, men end up being admins far far more frequently than their share of the teaching population would suggest. That's because they make paths for men to get there--boys sports get male teachers, and coaching becomes part of the path to advance to admin or counseling positions. Or men are used for 'disipline' or hall monitors or other sorts of things that give them authority, that naturally leads to them 'discovering' their path to becoming an admin--while that same system warms women that they SHOULDNT.   \n\n\nAnd then there's jobs that women, for the most part, physically struggle to do at the speed or pace of men, if they can do them at all. Many physical labor trades are like this--and even when they're not, they make sure the *culture* will make women horribly uncomfortable for attempting to break into the field.   \n\n\nMen pick jobs *where they get killed* more often than women do--that's part of it as well.",

A friend convinced him to take a long-term job at a holiday park in Saarland. Prior to that, he had worked as a seasonal worker in Switzerland for a year and a half. And on a cruise ship on the Rhine even as head of the cocktail bar: \"We worked together, and I had to do the planning: Who works in the early shift, late shift, and who can take a break and when? That was nice. Amor has been in Germany since October 2022, but his future is uncertain. He had completed a two-year apprenticeship in Tunisia and gained practical experience. In Germany, he has passed a language test, has a tax ID and health insurance. Nevertheless, the immigration office threatens to deny him another work permit - and to deport him.\n> \n> Hardly to comply with official requirements\n> \n> Now he hopes that he will be allowed to stay in Germany after proof of his expertise. However, the Chambers of Industry and Commerce have found that some official requirements can hardly be met. They exist in this form only in Germany. Mohamed Beni Amor lacks the so-called \"subject grade overview\" for training - and a \"framework curriculum\". That didn't exist in his home country, and that's why his work permit could ultimately fail.\n> \n> \n> Immigrants often work as unskilled workers\n> \n> When it comes to the recognition of foreign qualifications, the authorities distinguish between 600 German professions. Doctors or judges, for example, are regulated. There are access restrictions there, and employment is not possible without full recognition of the qualifications.More often, however, the professions in Germany are not regulated, for example in construction, in the IT sector, in industry or in social professions. Immigrants can also work there without recognition of their local education. In most cases, however, they are only used as helpers with lower wages and an uncertain right of residence.This must change, say experts such as Herbert Br\u00fccker from the Institute for Employment Research (IAB), which provides scientific support to the Federal Employment Agency. **\"We would have to move to testing qualifications much more and not degrees. See if someone is able to perform a qualified job. And then certify it.**\"\n> \n> Catching up - but squandering great opportunities\n> \n> From 2016 to 2021, 310,000 of the 230,000 applications for professional and training recognition in Germany were fully approved. However, you have to pay up to 600 euros for the application. Other editions are added: for documents such as certifications, translations and certificates.** In addition, all documents must be submitted by mail. Digitization is largely a foreign word among the registration offices.** For Thomas Liebig, chief economist at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), Germany has caught up in an international comparison, but is missing out on great opportunities for its own country and its inhabitants: \"Only four out of ten highly qualified immigrants from non-EU countries who are currently in Germany are also in highly qualified employment.\" It would be easy to get several hundred thousand more people into employment. According to Liebig, this could compensate for a large part of the shortage of skilled workers. Even if the need for personnel will increase in the coming years, especially due to the change of the baby boomer generation into retirement, he estimates that several hundred thousand people will be enough to fill the personnel gaps.\n> \n> New federal state, new hurdles\n> \n> But even for this, a lot still has to change in the authorities, as the example of Maria Rafols shows. Together with a colleague, she came from the Philippines. Both had a work permit in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. At the beginning of this year, they moved to a new clinic in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. **In a new federal state, however, there is a new immigration office, and it initially refused to grant a work permit. For a full three months, everything was checked again. It was not until May that both were allowed to work in a clinic again**. Training in the Philippines takes even longer than in Germany. The management of the rehabilitation clinic where the two work finds this annoying. For the time being, the new colleagues may only be admitted as assistants - despite their training.",

                "I\u2019m of the opinion that affirmative action should be based on economic status. Given that minorities are represented heavily by those families at or below the poverty line, they will still be represented in affirmative action while also including non-minority families as well.\n\nMy question for the experts is a critique of my thought above. What am I missing, or what are the unintended consequences of using economic status instead of race to guide affirmative action?",
                "What does this mean for students from underrepresented backgrounds seeking internships? What about the diversity and inclusion efforts led by companies? Are those initiatives under threat?",
                "The premise of the Supreme Court being above politics is no longer valid. The members themselves face scrutiny for their conduct wrt favors given by wealthy benefactors. What power do people have to demand accountability? Is there anything we can do as members of a democracy?",
                "Do you think it would be possible, based off this ruling, to bring a lawsuit challenging the idea of legacy admission?",
                "Have you noticed anything in your reporting which tried to reconcile the fact that upper middle class white women were the most likely to benefit from aa?",
                "After this ruling do you see any universities following Biden's suggestion of considering diversity and a student's lack of financial means in their admission standards?",
                "How long do you estimate till we see similar ruling concerning DEI in the corporate sector?",
                "How do you see this affecting workplace and government employment and advancement opportunities?",
                "What are the polling numbers for US voters on affirmative action? Here in California - a liberal state - we passed an initiative outlawing this racial discrimination. Are we outliers in California?",
                "It's been fascinating to watch coverage of this. Oddly very little of the media has covered the perspective of asians who definitely have felt discriminated  against. Nor has the coverage covered some of the facts of the case which clearly established that harvard did treat asians differently. This discrimination is  so well known that people actively hide their\"asianness\"  to help admissions. \n\nFor example this snippet from a harvard law professor writing for the new yorker often turns heads when said out loud:\n\n\"Harvard used an SAT score cutoff of 1310 for white students, 1350 for Asian American females, and 1380 for Asian American males. There were gasps in the courtroom when this evidence was revealed at trial. \"\n\nWhy is this not featured more prominently in your own reporting?",
                "Can you theologically defend the suppression of Asian Americans in applications to schools purely on the basis of skin color? As an Asian American myself AA seemed inherently racist and discriminatory for something that I didn't pick. I didn't ask to be born a minority, but now I'm punished for it? I'm just trying to grapple with how it can be perceived as good from my side. Thanks.",
                "Hello.  Do you agree with the Supreme Court ruling?",
                "Are there measurable impacts of \u201cdecades\u201d of affirmative action.  Is there data on the economic backgrounds of those who benefited from Affirmative Action?",
                "As emotionally charged as the ruling is, I've seen arguments that this will actually create incentives for schools to actually target any and all disadvantaged people by more accurate measurements of disadvantage, instead of using race as a convenient proxy. \n\nThe convenience here would be that of the school, since affirmative action relieves schools of much of the responsibility of understanding and controlling how their institution balances its advantaged and disadvantaged applicants.\n\nIn your reporting, have you spoken to anyone in higher education who acknowledges that affirmative action policies offer this kind of convenience to administrators?",
                "I don't get how Chief Justice John Roberts can claim the Constitution is been colorblind. There are 11 clauses that deal with or have policy implications for slavery in the Constitution, the second amendment in 1792 was about 18 to 45 year old white men, and women were under coverture laws.\n\nI guess this doesn't look so much like gutting affirmative action to me but instead upholding affirmative action for the elite. So I'm wondering as this gets more public attention, will more people realize that places like Harvard and Yale are less outstanding educational institutions and more as places where the elite play? Will these rulings help the public understand that a degree from a prestige ivy university has less to do with one's ability and more to do with one's social status?\n\nAlso, how is it acceptable that the military is exempt? Because that sounds like the supreme court is pushing those most marginalized out of gaining higher education and a leg up, and instead into military.",
                "What do you think of schools going to a lottery based system for admissions? Take all eligible applicants and randomly choose them to fill openings. Many high schools in the country already do this today. It seems like a fair system.",
                "Do you expect universities to now use loop holes (zip codes, essays, etc) to hit diversity marks or is the risk of law suit going to dissuade this?",
                "Hello Bianca and Josh, thanks for doing this. Do you know if this ruling will be enforced effective immediately? And do you think that this ruling could create major changes to the application process at top schools, or has the effect of AA on admissions processes been negligible thus far anyways?",
                "What can the current administration do to address existing inequalities in educational access in the wake of this decision?",
                "Given that race can not be considered, and financial need can sometime serve as a surrogate for race, how does this effect elite colleges that use needs blind admissions, meaning they do not look at the students financial status or ability to pay as part of the acceptance process?  Will they use home address of applicant to ensure a culturally diverse class, or something else?",
                "How is this not \"legislating from the bench\"?",
                "Were schools ever open with you about the mechanics of how the affirmative action policies actually worked? Or did they hide it just like with Prof. R. Sander or anyone else who asked?\n\nDid any school ever admit to you that Asians were penalized more than whites? Even if just incidentally, to reflect their share of the local/US population?\n\nHow come you (or POLITICO generally) don't give anti-affirmative action voices a fair share of your coverage?",

                "Why were my Asian co-workers disappointed this didn't happen sooner?",
                "Is there a strong reason for racial affirmative action to be preferred over a class based one? Many minorities are absolutely at a disadvantage due to historical systematic injustices that still affect them today, but don't these disadvantages present as economic ones? A class based AA would address those inequalities without involving the messiness of potential racial discrimination and not overcorrecting/undercorrecting for rich minorities and poor majorities.",
                "Affirmative action is racist. As an asian American, why should my application be artifically denied for someone else based on skin color? That's literal racism. If I worked hard to achieve a high score, and I have all As, why would an African American student who has B or C grades get chosen over me? Even if are tied, it shouldn't come down to race ever. Affirmative action is just corrective racism. It's still racism.",
                "Are there work-arounds for this, like what California is doing?",
                "Hi Bianca and Josh.  I have seen some people say universities can still consider race if the student describes their personal experience in the application.  Do you see this as a big enough loophole to minimize the impact of the ruling?",
                "Why has the whole debate focused around African Americans and Asians, when the Ivy league has been approximately 10% black and 20% Asian? White Ivy league students have lower GPAs and SAT/ACT scores than Asian students too.",
                "These are horrible, corrupt people - is the Supreme Court a sinking ship?",
                "What is the likelihood that we will see lawsuits against other programs that are income based, but by virtue of economics, \"disproportionately\" help minorities as a percentage of who gets the funds? Will this impact them in any way?\n\n\nSES is highly correlated to race and may as well be a proxy measure. I could easily foresee a situation where someone who is white sues for not receiving a Pell grant or other benefit and claims \"discrimination\" using the logic of this case.",

As in a lot of the misunderstanding might be from people who don\u2019t actually know what affirmative action is? Or its limits? Or its purpose?",
                "Why couldn\u2019t you just tie it to already in place \u201copportunity zones\u201d and then filter by household income? That would be a better metric anyway because there are a lot of impoverished non minority communities that could be served as well.",
                "What do you say to people insisting that an anonymous meritocracy is the better option, rather than affirmative action?\n\nAlso, I see a lot of people saying that affirmative action hurt certain non-white groups of citizens, and I was wondering if there is any truth to that?",
                "So we might actually be a meritocracy for once?",
                "I remember hearing some talks about one or more justices supporting \"total blindness\" in the admissions process several months back. What would the admissions process for people looking to apply to college now with this ruling?",
                "Why are military academies exempt from this ruling? Either the Equal Protection Clause applies or it doesn't.",
                "With the overturning of Roe v. Wade and now this (among others), is it realistic to be concerned about the overall legal value of precedent?",
                "Among other issues, I've wondered about the future political ramifications of conservative lead decisions that negatively affect students? Many college students are not happy with these decisions and I am wondering if that will lead to significant political shifts in the future?",
                "Given this decision and others, this feels like a money grab from the supreme court.  Are there any monetary or gift connections to the justices related to this ruling?",
                "I have two questions:\n1. Is there a constitutional basis for SCOTUS to challenge legacy admissions in the future if it's brought up?\n2. Is the target of AA to get black and brown people in university full stop? Or is it to get disadvantaged people into college?\n\nIf the latter, and if race has correlations with poverty and educational  disadvantage, why not just cut the middle man all together? If economic and educational disadvantages are what we want to target, I fail to see then why we need to make it raced based. The Supreme Court did the right  thing imo, since race based discrimination is unconstitutional, I think. \n\nTldr: Why not directly target what is (i think) purported to be the goal: economic disparity, without getting into questionable raced based territory?",
                "Does this ruling hurt asian Americans? If so, how and how much?",
                "How bad off is my daughter and are my nieces going to be because of this ruling?",
                "Serious question - why should proponents of diversity play fair or be bound by an outdated moral compass in the wake of this? \n\nThe right doesn't play fair. They stack the courts, refuse to follow policies they disagree with, they take on lawsuits, break laws and cheat around enforcement. Why should a pro diversity organization do any differently?\n\nIf I am an org with an affirmative action program, I'm keeping it and instituting a policy requiring records be destroyed within 30 days after a candidate is admitted. And I'll wait for some right winger to challenge that and wait for them to try to build up enough evidence to mount a challenge on the constitutional issue (that will take years).",
                "Is discrimination on the basis of race wrong?",
                "How will affirmative action based on economic status work? Does it mean that if two equally qualified persons apply, the university will give preference to the poorer applicant? Or maybe allocate a block of admissions for people with incomes below a threshold, and pick the best qualified from that lot?",
                "What about legacy admission?\n\nWhen preference giving to applicants who have family ties to an alumnus of a particular institution. For example, if a student's mother, father, or grandparent attended a university when they were younger, the student may receive special consideration during the admissions process.\n\nIs it addressed in any way? They are like 90% white and rich.",
                "Does this open the door for affirmative action to be struck down in other setting beyond college admissions?",
                "What do you think of Harvards approach of malicious compliance as laid out in their statement?",
                "Hey Bianca and Josh, with affirmative action gone, will colleges just have to draw straws to determine who gets in?",
                "You mean your admission to college is now based on qualifications and not race. That's the way it should be.",

            "selftext": "This post will ramble. I have too many emotions. Sorry in advance. \n\nI know this probably isn't the place for this post, but I have to get it off my chest. I have gone on a deep dive watching live streams from the hate campaign travelling around Ireland, harassing library staff and calling everyone who disagrees with their thoughts a pedophile or a groomer. These straight men have no idea what growing up LGBTQ+ is like. They have no idea what not getting any LGBT sex education can do to someone who is gay. \n\nHetetosexual sex education has always been offered at 5th and 6th class. However, the LGBTQ plus community are, and continue to be, completely ignored. So where did I, a 11 year old gay boy in rural Ireland, turn to for sex education? The Internet. This is almost 20 years ago, but I had no where else to go. This started a very rapid learning curve. My initial search into \"how do gay men have sex\" rapidly led to porn. By 12 I was watching porn daily, intrigued by this new world no one had ever talked about. By 13 I was watching extremely hardcore kink. You name, I watched it. All before I turned 14. I grew up thinking it was normal to be in pain during gay sex. It was normal to be forced into scenarios you didn't want. Kinks most people would never consider, never explore, to me were just the norm of gay sex. Piss, force, gang, sex with much older men are the mildest end of \"normal\". This lead in my later teens and early 20s to meeting with a lot of older men. I thought gay sex had to include everything I've seen in the videos, so that's what I looked for. \"Inexperienced young rural teen seeks older men for kinky fun\" was my Craigslist advert. Force, pain, groups, public sex and humiliating scenarios were all part of my coming of age story, and it wasn't until I got out of rural Ireland and made gay friends in the city that I realised... it wasn't the norm. \n\nThese books may seem unnecessary if you grew up receiving sex education that we useful to you. If you saw sex on TV programmes that you could identify with. However, books like \"This Book Is Gay\" offer essential support and knowledge to children like I was. To teens like I was. They may prevent these kids and teens from becoming a young adult like I was. If I had this book, maybe I would have ran to Craigslist to tick off an extremely long list that I felt I had to do, or I wasn't a real gay. \n\nThey can call us pedophiles and groomers, but i know from experience they are wrong. Sex education doesn't mean we are groomers. However, by education teens about sex relevant to their sexuality, it means the true groomer won't be able to manipulate them as easily.\n\nSorry of that's all nonsensical. In short, please support your local libraries! These books are important.",

                "Hope you know there's more of us (people that support LGBTQ rights and education) than there are these incel idiots who most likely have nothing going on in their heads that they were able to get caught by the online hate funnel as once you go down that hole I don't think there is any talking people out of it with common sense",
                "They call themselves \"The Silent Majority\" but they are in fact a very loud and fucking annoying Minority. \n\nThere's no point in arguing the point about whether people should have access to educational material regardless of their identity with them because they actually don't even believe that themselves, it's just thinly veiled hate speech. \n\nThe vast majority of the population see them for what they are which is hateful morons. \n\nI don't have any \"skin in the game\" if you will, as a straight Irish man i've no clue what hardship the people being targeted by these dunces get. What I and the vast majority of people who i know do have is to have actual empathy for other humans and support for their rights to education.",
                "They don't actually give a toss about children. \n\nA lot of them have just fallen pray to fear mongering and propaganda under the guise of \"concern for kids safety.\". The truth is they've just fallen into full blown bigotry.\n\nSome 30 years ago my parents got me a book on sex and sexuality, explaining things like different body shapes, how sex works and it was all harmless but educational stuff. No harm in having the same stuff for LGBTQ+ kids at all.",
                "Those guys are scumbags. And I 100% agree that LGBT+ teens need sex ed just as much as everyone else. \n\nI had some extra time on my hands lately and went deep diving myself.

This whole palaver might all be done under the guise of \"protecting the children\" but it seems little more than a handy excuse to openly protest against the LGBTQ community and acceptance thereof.\n\nIf they thought they could get away with it they'd totally be out there protesting your mere existence.",
                "These idiots think that children and teenagers can be turned gay by consuming material that isn't deemed heteronormative or culturally accepted. A little boy dressing up as a princess is somehow more offensive than a little boy dressing as a dinosaur.",
                "I agree with everything you said, OP. If it makes you feel any better, the majority of the country are against those eejitts. \n\n\nI always find it insane that the parents who don\u2019t want their kids learning about sex education, gay or straight, are at the same time completely fine with giving their 10 year old an iPhone with unlimited internet access. It\u2019s unbelievable stupidity. Wouldn\u2019t you rather have your child lead the facts about sex and relationships from a book instead of hard core porn ?",
                "Spent 10 years working as a nurse in London. Had gay flatmates and workmates. Had many a heavy sesh in gay bars in that time. The absolute non-impact anyone's sexual orientation had on my life was remarkable. These morons are WILFULLY ignorant. Pay no heed, as difficult as it is these days. Trust me when I say they are the loud minority.",
                "I'm a bit surprised myself at how prevalent some of these thoughts are in a lot of people. I mentioned it in passing the other day to a shop keeper who I frequent and they said they fully agree with them \"because of all these mad laws they're passing now\". I didn't argue with him because what would be the point. \n\nBut I think these ideas are unfortunately more prevalent than a lot of people might appreciate. Truthfully when the gay marriage referendum passed I think a lot of people went \"right, that's it, solved now\" when actually, like racism, a lot of homophobia is silent.",
                "Saw your post briefly on CasualIreland, but it was locked before I could reply.\n\nThe jist of what I was gonna say was that I can relate to what you've said, not in terms of some of the extremes, but the general feeling of the post. I realised during secondary school that I wasn't straight, but spent the rest of my time there not fully understanding or being able to articulate how I felt. Sex-ed for us, even in 6th year, consisted of our retirement-age male religion teacher showing us pictures of what STIs looked like. Not helpful. No mention of same-sex couples, despite there being an openly gay lad and a number of deeply closeted guys.\n\nThose right-wing nut jobs cannot understand that its simply not a choice to be gay, or LGBT+. If it were a choice, most of us would have opted for the easier life and \"decided\" to be straight. Education would have helped me no end. Starting in primary school (because deep down a lot of kids have an idea by then) and continuing throughout secondary school.\n\nGay people don't want to groom your children. If anything, our society grooms us to be heteronormative. We just want to ensure that, through awareness, support and education, the next generation of LGBTQ+ youth are guided through their life with love.",

It\u2019s just gratuitously graphic.\n\nIf parents are cool letting their 10-12 year-olds read it, let them buy it.

                " \n\nThe Florida Department of Education is raising alarm with its recent approval of the conservative education platform PragerU, which touts itself as an alternative to progressive \u201cindoctrination,\u201d for use in classrooms this school year.\n\nThe \u201csupplemental curriculum\u201d means educators can if they choose show PragerU materials in class without fear of repercussions, with video titles ranging from \u201cWas the Civil War About Slavery?\u201d to \u201cThe Inconvenient Truth About the Democratic Party.\u201d\n\nCritics contend PragerU has promoted videos with misinformation and is too biased for public schools, escalating the controversy regarding changes to Florida\u2019s education system under Gov. Ron DeSantis (R).\n\nHere\u2019s what to know about PragerU and the fallout in Florida:\n\n## What is PragerU?\n\nPragerU is a conservative platform that was founded by conservative talk show host Dennis Prager and Allen Estrin in 2009.                                                                                                                     \n\nOn its site, it touts itself as a nonprofit focused on \u201ca free alternative to the dominant left-wing ideology in culture, media, and education.\u201d\n\nThe platform gained popularity from short videos on topics ranging from a host of political issues. Some of the platform\u2019s most popular five-minute videos include \u201cIs Islam a Religion of Peace\u201d and \u201cMake Men Masculine Again.\u201d\n\nPragerU says its videos have garnered 7 billion views, and that 70 percent of viewers changed their mind on at least one topic after watching their videos.\n\nIn 2021, PragerU launched PragerU Kids and started creating lesson plans for educators to use. The lessons cover a variety of topics such as history, financial knowledge and political issues.                                                                                                                                                                \n\n## PragerU in Florida schools\n\nPragerU celebrated last month that educators in Florida are now allowed to use their content in schools.\n\n\u201cThe state of Florida just announced that we are becoming an official vendor,\u201d CEO Marissa Streit said. \u201cThis means if you are a teacher in Florida you can not be fired for using PragerU content.\u201d                                                                                                                                                              \n\u201cThe Florida Department of Education reviewed PragerU Kids and determined the material aligns to Florida\u2019s revised civics and government standards. PragerU Kids is no different than many other resources, which can be used as supplemental materials in Florida schools at district discretion,\u201d a spokesperson for the agency said.                                                      \n\n## Pushback from critics\n\nThe approval spurred backlash from critics who say PragerU has pushed misinformation and shows the direction Florida education is going.\n\n\u201cI think, broadly, the videos on the content have been criticized by some for their portrayal of things like race, explanations of differences of poverty levels by race or the history of racism and slavery in the country. I\u2019ve also seen criticisms around issues like climate change,\u201d Curran said.\n\nOne of the PragerU Kids lessons challenges climate change and the effects of fossil fuels.\n\n\u201cKids are told to fight climate change but are rarely taught about the human cost of reducing emissions. This animated video teaches middle and high school students about energy and the environment through the eyes of young Ania living in Poland, who must face a devastating winter after the Polish government bans the use of coal,\u201d the video description reads.\n\nAnia becomes a climate change activist until she is challenged with some \u201cthought-provoking questions\u201d from her parents.\n\n\u201cRecently, Ania\u2019s classmates have all been talking about climate. Like many people around the world, they think that Poland\u2019s smog and carbon emissions will contribute to rising temperatures across the planet,\u201d the narrator of the video says.\n\nLater, the video says her parents raised questions after Ania became anxious about climate change, saying the Earth has always been warming and cooling and pointing out Poland has fewer emissions than countries such as China.\n\n\u201cHer parents\u2019 questions have made Ania wonder if she\u2019s only been hearing one side of the argument at school and in her online community. She definitely has some research to do,\u201d the video says.\n\nOther PragerU Kids videos include \u201cHow to be a rational patriot\u201d and \u201cHow to embrace your femininity.\u201d\n\nThis is not PragerU\u2019s first brush with controversy.\n\nIn 2020, it Lost A Lawsuit after suing Google for YouTube flagging some of its videos as \u201cinappropriate.\u201d Some of the video titles that were flagged were \u201cAre 1 in 5 Women Raped at College?\u201d and \u201cWhy Isn\u2019t Communism as Hated as Nazism?\u201d\n\n## Escalating tensions in Florida\n\nFlorida has become a hot spot for education controversy as DeSantis\u2019s administration solidifies what sort of curriculum it wants to be taught in its classrooms.\n\nLawmakers have buckled down on approved materials, with state officials banning the discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity in K-12 schools.\n\nThe curriculum standards for African American history also got revamped, with criticisms arising after the changes said students would learn that enslaved people \u201cdeveloped skills\u201d that helped them during American slavery.\n\nThe curriculum changes led to AP African American studies getting rejected in Florida. The College Board is also battling with Florida over AP Psychology, with the company saying the course cannot count for credit without lessons on gender identity and sexual orientation.\n\n\u201cWe hope now that Florida teachers will be able to teach the full course, including content on gender and sexual orientation, without fear of punishment in the upcoming school year,\u201d the College Board said.",

                "I would first counter that if a divorce happens, the \"home\" was already \"wrecked\". The ending of a relationship, especially one that has legal dissolution measures, isn't generally just done for funsies or on a whim. Just because a relationship persists doesn't mean it's good, healthy, or loving. A dysfunctional relationship can limp along for decades, causing pain in its wake, because there are no other options and people are miserable.\n\nYes, women are more likely to initiate divorce (https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20220511-why-women-file-for-divorce-more-than-men). But this doesn't mean that women are fickle, flighty, or irresponsible. Instead, it is more likely to reflect \"traditional\" gender roles in a changing world. Women are still often responsible for the majority of the housework and childcare, regardless of the amount of money they make (https://www.npr.org/2023/04/13/1168961388/pew-earnings-gender-wage-gap-housework-chores-child-care).\n\nMany women talk about how they feel like the \"manager\" of the household, with the male partner responding and being told what to do, not taking initiative on his own. It comes up in comics like \"You Should've Asked\" (https://english.emmaclit.com/2017/05/20/you-shouldve-asked/), where women tend to have to carry the mental load of the household. Some of this might come from a \"natural\" outgrowth: she is more likely to have maternity leave than a male partner, and begins the child's life as the primary caregiver, but then he never \"catches up\", and before either of them know it, she's taking care of the lion's share of the household tasks because he \"doesn't know how to do it\" and she finds it easier to just do it herself than to ask over and over.\n\nThis can build resentment. Matthew Fray touched on it in his essay, \"She Divorced Me Because I Left Dishes By the Sink\" (https://matthewfray.com/2016/01/14/she-divorced-me-because-i-left-dishes-by-the-sink/). His wife didn't leave because of the dishes. Instead, he uses them as a marking point of how she felt like her preferences didn't matter, and he had a tendency to dismiss her requests because they didn't really matter to him. He wasn't being a *partner* and listening or compromising his own behavior to be considerate to his wife. A lot of people see themselves in this essay, in either partner's perspective.\n\nThese scenarios are common: one partner feels like they're doing \"more\" than the other, asks the other to step it up, the other is dismissive or makes promises they don't keep, and the relationship is damaged. If that partner is asking over and over, telling the other how important it is to be heard, eventually, they either give up (no one's listening) or they start shouting to be heard. Either way, they're reaching the end of the rope, but the other partner often misinterprets this. The silence means that the problem doesn't exist, and the shouting means that their partner's an asshole.\n\nBy the time the divorce papers are served, one partner is likely *done*. They've talked and talked and talked and can talk no more, because the other wasn't listening. Now that there's a real consequence (a divorce) on the field, suddenly, the other partner is ready to listen, to go to therapy, whatever, just to save the relationship, but the time for that was long ago. There's nothing to save.\n\nFrom the MetaFilter \"Emotional Labor\" thread (http://www.victorkumar.org/uploads/6/1/5/2/61526489/emotional_labor_-_the_metafilter_thread_condensed-.pdf):\n\n> I had a good husband that I loved but because of one major issue, I had to leave him. He continues to this day to be confused about why I left. Which is nuts, because, being a big believer in open communication, I told him more times than I can remember \u2013 \u201cHey, [this issue] is a real problem for me. I feel scared/sad/worried/depressed when you do it. I can\u2019t live like this. I love you but if something doesn\u2019t change, I will have to leave.\u201d I was that direct. I told him this multiple times. \n\n> Then, when I finally did leave we had multiple long arguments about why I was leaving because as he said, he was a good husband! He never hit me, he never messed around with other women, he helped around the house, etc. I was like \u2013 that is BASELINE behavior. You don\u2019t get awards for things you are or are not supposed to be doing to begin with! I reminded him I told him multiple times what my problems were and what I would do if they were not addressed. I actually reminded him of this MULTIPLE TIMES AS WELL. It was insanity. I was like, THERE IS NO WAY FOR ME TO BE MORE CLEAR ON THIS. He still doesn\u2019t know why I left and that encapsulates it for me. He heard what he wanted to hear, what was convenient for him. If it didn\u2019t cause him any issues, he had no problem listening to me and hearing what I said. If it did, he mentally disregarded it. \n\nThe \"partner\" tends to be a woman in these scenarios and the \"other\" tends to be a man, just because of how people are socialized in their gender (but of course, can be any combination of genders!). That's part of why women are more likely to initiate a divorce: the whole system of \"traditional\" gender diminishes their voices, so even when they *do* speak up about relationship problems, they tend to be seen as overreacting, being emotional/hysterical/hormonal, being nitpicky or nagging, and their male partners do not listen to them or value their opinions.\n\nBut that's complicated and has to deal with actual human emotions, like how we often punish boys and men for being vulnerable, so many of them struggle to communicate in difficult or emotional situations, or how we devalue women's contributions to the home as something they're \"naturally good at\", etc. And that's difficult, because people like Lori like a nice, prescriptive, one-size-fits-all, where there's a simple answer: just don't let women get divorced.\n\nBecause that will make for good, happy homes, and it's not like when women struggled to get divorced (because they couldn't have things like their own bank accounts and access to money, for example), there was a problem with women drugging themselves to get through the day or anything. It was great, just like you saw on TV with \"Leave It To Beaver\", because that was a realistic depiction of home, not a TV show.",

                "A graphic used by the BBC on an education show in 1989 on the 10th year anniversary of the end of the British civil war.  Point of divergence was 29 April 1970 when the Lithgow Plot was successful thanks to the use of explosives provided by the IRA, killing Elizabeth II  and Prince Philip during their tour of Australia. In the aftermath a young King Charles III turned heavily to advice from Lord Mountbatten, who in turn fearing for the stability of the nation after re-election of Labour Party leader Harold Willson,  launched an attempted coup in 1974.  Overestimating his support from the military and the public,  civil war broke out between the Royalist forces backing Mountbatten and the Parliamentary Forces backing Wilson. With the USA exhausted by Vietnam and unwilling to get involved in another conflict so soon  the war dragged on until extremist factions took hold on both sides supported by NATO and the Warsaw Pact.  A ceasefire in 1979 saw a DMZ formed along the 54th parallel with heavily contested York made a neutral city.",

When white people suffer the media has to be involved (see Ukraine\ud83d\udd95\ud83c\udffevs russia) as opposed to Syria or Palestine. \n\nEven though the slave trade benefitted most white people today (either directly or indirectly) they have to accept it was wrong, so better not to discuss it as they can't do that. They always have to be right, that's the key. Either don't teach about slavery, or make it positive. But they can talk about the holocaust all day because it was white people killing (predominantly) white people, so no guilt.\n\nFurthermore, the guilt isn't guilt as a normal person would feel guilt. Their guilt is self serving, to give in to guilt would open the door to reparations, a potential shift in world powers (because for sure America, England and Europe should owe Africa and the Caribbean their entire gdp). But most of all, to admit to guilt, would mean they are not the best/default humans.  Ever since the Enlightenment these fucks have been thinking the same way, education is just the latest way they get us to a '1984' state \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffe \n\nThey remove enough of the past for one or two generations and its gone forever.

Africa nations participate in lotteries to gain American citizenship the same way we do the mega million.\n\nYes, you can make the argument that African nations would have turned out different without European intervention in the first place, but the argument could also be made that the results wouldn\u2019t be much different.  \n\nWe get caught up looking at our white counterparts in America, that we don\u2019t ever stop to look at the whole board.

                "Imo, the best solution to this is to start practicing group economics. We have to start being selfish with our dollar and start investing more into our communities. Many sources have claimed that our dollar circulates for less than six hours in our communities, which is obviously a problem. Almost every other race of people will purposefully spend with their own people\u2026..we as black people in this country do not. As someone else here said, we must invest in our own hospitals, schools, supermarkets, and police force. Additionally, we gotta establish our own banks and manufacturing / distribution facilities and stores so our people will have somewhere to buy basic needs. For example, instead of buying our hair products from Asian people selling products tailored to us, we need to instead buy from the black owner selling products intended for us. I want to emphasize that strictly doing business and helping only our communities in NOT being racist as some may think. What other groups of people invest in black communities if it isn\u2019t beneficial to them monetarily somehow? None. \n\nMore about the Florida implementation though, it\u2019s absolutely absurd and insulting to African Americans dead and alive. For Florida to start downplaying the effects of slavery on our people and their offspring and to have the nerve to want to teach Florida children it was actually advantageous for us is honestly more proof that this country is getting worse (not that it was ever good to begin with) and never liked black people. We should\u2019ve never allowed the schools to teach us about our history anyways because of course, they\u2019re trying to save face and keep black people from knowing our true history. Tbh though, I doubt if white folks even know the history anyways. Instead of our history being taught where slavery began, that history could start at Mansa Musa, the richest person to ever live. But only we can teach our kids these things either through the creation of our own self funded schools or through home schooling.",

                "Learning stuff like 1-10 and colors in kindergarten seems extremely late IMO.",
                "My kid is 4.5 and this is what I've learned from reviewing the curriculum at school, talking to teachers, and other parents and friends:   \nAt ages 3-4, most children do know colours and shapes and counting 1-10. This is pretty true whether the kid goes to preschool or not. This is pretty basic knowledge and not very academic at all; a lot of them learn this from watching Cocomelon or Ms. Rachel or whatever   \nFrom 4-5, whether it's preschool or transitional kindergarten or junior kindergarten or whatever you want to call it, the focus is definitely on math and reading \"readiness\"   \nThat means building up the skills necessary to later start reading and writing and doing math. So what's worked on is alphabet recognition (both upper case and lower case letters), letter sounds (in preparation for phonics or sounding it out), some short 2 and 3-letter sight words, numbers past 10, some addition and subtraction. That sounds pretty academic for 4-5 year olds, but a lot of schools teach this stuff for like an hour a day and are play-based; they still get plenty of time for outdoors education, art, sensory play, etc.  \n\n5-7 is when actual reading and writing become the focus/expectation",

The expensive schools are all play based and the affordable schools are all academic focused. \n\nI\u2019m starting to hate preschool and if I could redo my preschools years over again I would. Any preschool that talks about academics would be an automatic no. I would do 2 years of a forest/outdoor school and I would find a play based kindergarten.

I could read before I got to kindergarten, so that was a bonus, but most kids were just learning at that point. \n\nMy own kids just went through kindergarten a few years ago and they were required to show up. It was mostly play based, not a lot of milestones to meet. There were no pre-requisites, either. My kids did a little bit of numbers and letters but I remember my kinder being so much more advanced. I even brought up reading with my oldest daughters kinder teacher and she kind of laughed and said they didn\u2019t even think about that till grade 2. Didn\u2019t turn out to be true as they did some reading learning in grade 1, but the point stands that it\u2019s not focused on hard learning but more easing kids into the classroom environment.",
                "Yes, somewhat. They probably don\u2019t expect mastery and it\u2019s important to realize that kids develop at very different paces. But exposure to concepts early is still great. \n\nOne of my children is 4. He is a bit behind for his age and always has been. He can count to 10 (working on 20 and almost has mastery), write some letters and is learning letter sounds, knows most basic shapes and colors, etc. He\u2019s pretty good with cutting, gluing, etc. and greet at fine motor skills. He\u2019s working on a second language at school (they don\u2019t do immersion though, it\u2019s just a class so I consider it exposure more than learning at this point). I\u2019d say this is pretty far behind for his age but on the right track for his personal development. I just made sure he is in a school where his individual needs are considered and he starts pre-k this year and I\u2019ll start homeschooling (supplementally) to make sure he\u2019s confident in the things that matter and reading (or at least set up to learn.) \n\nMeanwhile, my two (almost three) year old knows all of her letters, knows all the days of the week, gets dressed mostly independently, is starting to learn to read (she isn\u2019t forced she is just naturally interested), knows many shapes and colors, and can count to 20 but sometimes stumbles on a few numbers, knows most of the contents, talks about syllables and understands clapping them out, packs her lunches away and chops things in the kitchen\u2026 she\u2019s just really interested. She\u2019s probably more advanced of the two of them. \n\nAnd that is fine! I think their main job right now is to play and absorb. I try to focus on making sure each of them\nAre challenged enough on their own level, supported, encouraged, and feel proud of their individual accomplishments. They are young. I care that they learn, but I don\u2019t care that they learn at a super competitive rate. \n\nNormal is relative. It\u2019s also irrelevant. Focus on meeting the needs of your own child and it will all work out.",
                "I think TK as they now call it or young fives tend to be larger programs today in some school districts due to some school districts having higher academic expectations.\n\nMy kindergarten teacher quit over the change because she felt that social skill development is more important and she was upset about being forced to use leveled reading books, etc.",
                "Yes, educational standards have changed drastically, but there is some nuance.  It may help you to look up kindergarten standards and kindergarten readiness specific for your area for a clearer picture of where you are going.  Remember that your child has probably 3 years before they start school to be there.  You are just starting learning the preschool stuff and little kids learn fast.\n\nColors, learning some letters, and learning some counting have long been preschool things.  There are good play-based ways to learn those though.  For example, playing outside and counting how many rocks, looking for the biggest leaf, or making designs in the dirt are all getting ready for math.  Listening to a story being read aloud is probably the most important activity to be ready for reading.  In my area lower quality preschools tend to be more worksheet-y which at this age doesn't result in as much learning as other methods.",
                "Yep, my impression is that it's a mistake socially.  We should let our children be children before grinding the joy of learning out of them, but this is the new standard.\n\nAnd I'm someone who very, very heavily values knowledge and learning and our family culture values it, too.  Drilling 5 year olds in math problems doesn't seem like that's going to help them appreciate and enjoy mathematics in the long run.",
                "I think everything has advanced at least a year if not more. My 2nd grader knows all of her multiplication and division facts through twelves. I don\u2019t remember learning that until 4th grade.",
                "There are indeed a number of schools that focus on academic learning early. When my kids' preschool started going to this kind of a model with worksheets, we dropped out, took a bunch of parents with us, and created our own preschool for half a year so they could all graduate.\n\nThat said, that was when they were 4. Three years old sounds ludicrously early to start this sort of thing -- so early that I'd wonder what they're actually planning to DO regarding \"math and reading readiness\".  Some activities may be harmless or standard, and they're just using that phrase because they think it's what parents will want to hear. Other activities might be simply wrong or harmful by introducing unneeded and excessive stress.",
                "Based on reading all the comments this is a highly stressful environment for a child. Why is it that in USA everything is measured and then a child is judged for achieving these \u201cmilestones\u201d. Who came up with these? If a child fails these milestones everybody tries to intervene. Excessive judgement right from birth. I studied in India and excessive academic pressure leads to depression, low self esteem. I still have scars from my childhood where we were pushed so hard in school and the whole society judged you based on grades. This stuff has long term ramifications. As adults we all ended up in the same socio economic status. So what does all the grading mean?",
                "I live in a country where daycare/kindergarten focuses in play and doing stuff outside. The director of one of those places told me that it used to be more formal and kids were taught to read and write and so on. Then she told me that, she has never met an adult person who went through schooling and never managed  learn to read and write. So, those are skills that eventually will be learn. However, she has met a lot of people who struggle to socialize. Therefore she believes that is more important to teach them to socialize, develop bonds, empathy and independence. Reading and writing will come later.",
                "Look at your state standards of what kids are expected to know at the end of each grade. \n\nWhat kids are expected to know and how kids are expected to behave when they ENTER kindergarten is what used to be taught in kindergarten. \n\nMy kid was evaluated for special Ed prek last year, about 2 weeks before his 3rd birthday. I looked at the OT like she was insane when she asked me \"how are his scissor skills?\" **Because who the hell willing gives a 2/3 year old scissors of any kind?!** His lack of being able to use scissors to cut a line was one of the key reasons why they offered any OT services at all.",

You should be able to access your state\u2019s standards/requirements for each grade and content area through your state\u2019s office of education/board of education/whatever your state has. In my state, the schools must teach these standards and are assessed on how effectively they do them. \n\nHere are some examples: \n\n[state of utah early learning (pre-k) standards](https://www.uen.org/core/prek/)\n\n[kinder ELA standards](https://www.uen.org/core/core.do?courseNum=4211)",

                "My kid learned colors and 1-10 by 2, at 4.5 she\u2019s counting to 100 and can read 3 letter words. \nShe can also write the whole alphabet lowercase and upper.. she learned the bulk of it at home and the rest in preschool.",
                "Adding to this,  my son is expressive language delayed and uses sign to communicate.   He understands English, Spanish, and sign and has hit developmental milestones without issue.  But if they expect him to 'read' out loud words like 'the' etc, many of those don't exist in sign. And most teachers don't know full sign.  So, this looks like I'm setting him up to fail. \n\nInfo: yes we have him in speech therapy,  etc.  He is making progress,  but probably not enough to be able tp read out loud in a year or two.",

Why would you go out of your way to mock someone who went through something as horrible as long term infertility? \n\nPeople have infertility issues at all ages as it rarely comes down to age and has more to do with things like disability or things they were born with.   Those are things that can be treated but not changed.   But you being a dink and a jerk is a choice.",
                "My daughter just finished kindergarten and went into it knowing ABC's, counting 1-20 and simple addition and subtraction on numbers 1-5.\n\nShe is starting 1st grade and is already reading simple chapter books like the Amelia Bedelia series.\n\nAlmost all of that was NOT the school's doing but mine.  I've read two books to her for bedtime every night since she was 6 months old.  Every.  Night.\n\nIt finally paid off.",

                "When i was in kindergarten everyone already knew how to read and write and do math. Parents taught me multiplication problems as a 3 year old. Never too early to start learning",
                "Yes. The standardized scores kept being low and they kept pushing for reading readiness and math proficiency. They're still low. Lol. \n\nHaving said that. It's really pretty simple and easy stuff. My kids have excelled in their grades. To the point that I wonder if we should skip because they already seem to know what their homework is currently teaching, or maybe it just makes that much sense to them immediately. For context: we are homeschooling, so it's not a traditional sit in school all day and reiterate things onto tests environment. 1st and 3rd graders. Don't mistake me. They still have to learn things. Learning to read doesn't come naturally to every kid and neither does English grammar, or learning to borrow in subtraction. \n\nI was just looking at the upcoming school year's curriculum today and was surprised to see how different first grade was. It's only been two years since I last did first and it was the same line of books. It's so bad that they're no longer including science in the big comprehensive book that's supposed to be for the whole year. And math? There's a significant difference in the amount compared to the other subjects. We love science and art, so I'm having to put in extra work to supplement and get them adequate science education. *Le sigh* We're starting school the third week of August.",
                "They are probably trying to prepare the kids for kindergarten.  What are they expected to know before they start?  You can call the school to ask or sometimes it\u2019s posted on a schools web page. I think my kid was supposed to know all of his letters, sounds, colors, 1-20 numbers, and how to write their name.  That was considered the minimum at the beginning of the year or they were labeled behind grade level.",
                "Its normal, they\u2019re prepping him for school, if in the US. Then TK begins at 4yrs old if the child turns 5 by 4/2/24. It goes to 6/2/25 for school year 24/25. As long as he is grasping it or being around it, it will help immensly with reading & math!",
                "My kids is two and knows A to G and counts to 10.\n\nBesides test him i haven\u2019t done anything else for him to be there.\n\nHe seems to be behind other kids in pronunciation. I\u2019m honestly impressed with where his class is at daycare",
                "Yes. Standards have changed since I was in Kindergarten in the 90\u2019s!\n\nOn a global scale, we need to remain competitive with countries that push a much more aggressive education.",
                "I think this varies by country.  It's interesting that quite a few comments here are talking about the 'rigorous' approach at ages 3-5.  But the schools with the very highest ratings always come from countries that delay academics, such as Finland, in favour of play-based learning in the younger years.  \n\nI'm in Canada and our kindergartens are play based.  Kids are taught the alphabet and sounds, and introductory numeracy (but not math).  It's mainly play based.",

                "Since mosaics are small pieces assembled to make a design, have you tried taking one simple design element and making a mosaic effect? Just a thought.",
                "These are all really good and well executed. At first I wasn't really getting a media or educational vibe from any of them, but then after a few seconds I decided the fourth one feels more educational as it reminds me of a brand for novels, and the first one more like a media company\u2014something about the 4 sections makes me think of a tv network logo. The second is nice, but I don't think it works for what you're aiming for. The emphasis on the M works too well compared to the T part with the leaves on top and it doesn't stand out as much. The third one almost has a good mix of media and education. It looks like a pie chart (relating to education) and then one of the slices almost makes like a play button (for media). And that's all I got!",
                "I like second option",
                "Top one is brilliant, its only fault is that it's too detailed. That is by principle a bad design choice. But I just love it nevertheless.\n\nThe fourth one at the bottom is easily the most technically appropriate design. It is compact, witty, and memorable. I'd personally go with that one.\n\nThe third one is too dull for my taste, even though it arguably uses the conceptual elements of a mosaic better than the rest.\n\nAnd the second one seems too detached from the main theme of mosaics. But an otherwise great logo that I would not mind seeing on a road sign or nameplate atop a restraunt.",

The second is clean but oh so corporate. Looks more like a home delivery meal kit. The third one screams math or nutrition due to the pie chart. The bottom has potential but again, looks like a kids toy due to the bright primary palette. The text seems like an afterthought. I wouldn\u2019t break up the icons\u2014keep them together and add the type to the right instead. Stop trying to be so creative with the type in all options (remember you\u2019ll need to break it up for your final iterations for different uses\u2026how is #2 going to stack??) Choose new colors that are more natural.",

                "Since this is for education, the top one. I would modify it to arrange the two words around the circumference on the bottom half of the circle.

But just a bit. \n\nAnother thing I would work on the the 4 leaf symbol. So you have the lemon, the apple and the cup that are only one shape but the leaves are 4 small shapes\u2026. It kind of disturb me a bit. Try to add only one leaf shape \u2026. It will make the logo a bit more simple. \n\nAlso may I suggest for you to work in black an white. With a logo such this one, colors can be a distraction. With black and white only it easier to spot problems in shape spacing and those things.",

I can't tell if it's the lockup, the typeface, or both.\n\nI would try some different things to see if they mesh better with the simple shapes you've chosen. Maybe a sans serif instead of a slab serif? Maybe a different weight is all it needs? Maybe the text should be separate instead of separating the shapes? \n\nIt just needs a bit more refinement. I love the simplicity of the shapes.",

I like it but the \"mosaic\" really needs to be leaned into on the secondary elements of the brand. \n3. I don't remember what I thought about it since writing this. \n4.

In India, sex education is a joke in many places.\n\nLike seriously, they skipped it in 6th standard (we were like 10 or 11 so it's kinda acceptable to skip), they skipped it in highschool and hell they even skipped that during our college times. \n\nHow are teens supposed to learn about it when teachers are not willing to come forward and educate their students. Sure as hell we can't expect our parents to teach that stuff when they don't even know what sex education is. \n\nTeens are curious, teens are keen to know what's what! So what's the result of that? PORN!!\n\nI bet 99.99% people in India learnt about what is sex through only dirty movies. I can even show a few movies where in they explicitly teach their fellow actor about sex through some low B grade movies.\n\nI'm also a victim of this, porn ruined me. I wish my teachers educated me then and there about what's what. \n\nNow what happens to those people who do not have access to porn? Rape, sexual assault, etc..\n\n(Sorry if my English is bad)",

In many places, you need a degree and a certification to be a carpenter, not to mention a years long apprenticeship. Same with plumbing, electrical, HVAC. Things that everybody wants, but seemingly nobody wants to learn. \n\nWhat about accounting? Everybody who is a JW praises accounting because \"you can go to bethel.\"\nThat's a 4 year course, with 2 years apprenticeship in my state. What if I want to become an RN? I'd be crucified. What if I want to do volunteer work for a charity like the Red Cross of Habitat for Humanity that helps the homeless, poor, downtrodden, and needy? \n\"But, but, field service is the only thing that matters!\"\nTell that to the millions of children who have died from disease and hunger who you could have helped by keeping them alive and teaching them about God, by showing your love just like the Samaritan did.\n\nBut no. Watchtower can never bring itself down to Jesus level, by caring for the needy, feeding the poor, and helping those of a different religion.\n\nIt always amazes me how any Witness will look at the Samaritan example, and say \"but the organization doesn't need to do that, because preaching is the true charity!\"\n\nIf that was true, why did Jesus say \"Go and do so yourself\" after telling the tale of the good Samaritan?",

Are we to rely on the money from other poor or struggling members in the congregation to take care of everyone who can't make ends meet. This really pissed me off because I remember when my mom was coming back into the \"truth\" as a single mother she needed to go back to school to get a job and she was uncessarily worried or asking the friends if it would be okay for her to take the education route...to provide for her own kids \ud83d\udc80 or she would ask if it was okay to be a substitute teacher on a military base.

And because the phone calls about the last minute change went directly to teachers \u2014 bypassing district administrators and even principals \u2014 there was no paper trail to follow to figure out what was going on.\n\nNot cool, to say the least.",

                "This is trying to make a big deal out of nothing.\n\nThe course is a pilot program that in the fall will launch to about 650 high schools out of [more than 23,000 in the U.S.](https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=84), or less than 3 percent.  Since the course first launched to 60 schools in the fall of 2022 and the curriculum became public, the College Board (a private company) changed the course, backtracked, and changed the course again so many times it is impossible to keep track with their current story. I can\u2019t blame any state for not wanting to give credit for this privately developed (and redeveloped) course, especially when it is so new.\n\nThere also does not appear to be an easily available current curriculum. [I found the 2022 course guide](https://arktimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/AP-African-American-Studies-Pilot-Guide-1.pdf), but I think this may be out of date because it still includes \"The Movement for Black Lives,\" which CB claims was removed.\n\nI also see some legitimate criticisms of the 2022 curriculum, but there will always be legitimate criticism of any curriculum. A quick search for keywords turned up page 151 (157 of the PDF) which is about HBCUs. The reading list gives an uncritical, positive view on HBCUs, and what can be described as voluntarily self-segregating (HBCUs admit students of any race and are not officially segregated). But the same principles are being [applied at a younger age with \"Afrocentric\" public (charter) schools](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/08/nyregion/afrocentric-schools-segregation-brooklyn.html). They admit students of any race, but the students are predominantly black. The schools \"have been championed by black educators who had traumatic experiences with integration.\"\n\nWill AP students know about these types of consequences of HBCUs and voluntarily self-segregation? Will the AP require readings on the use of public funds to support institutions that are segregated in practice, even if not by law? What kind of materials will there be on modern segregation and integration? Will there be anything to suggest HBCUs are anything other than positive and how will teachers be trained to guide those discussions? \n\nThis isn't a math class.

                "The fact that they have changed the history of slavery to \"slaves benefitted from what they learned\" \n\nWe need to be teaching actual history. \n\n\"Slavery was the norm for thousands of years. During battles, the tribe who won would take survivors of said battle as slaves. \nHowever, in the 1600s slavery changed. No longer were slaves the \"spoils of war\", now Europeans landed in Africa and kidnapped entire villages to ship them to their lands. It started with Portugal sending Africans to Brazil to work the plantations, and shortly most countries in Europe had forts on the African coast. \nIn the US, slaves were predominantly in the South working on plantations. When President Lincoln proclaimed that all men were free men, it was the tipping point for the South to secede....civil war....union won...etc etc.\"\n\nWhy is this difficult? Who is it harming to teach the truth? Yet conservatives have been lying about history for years. When I was in school in South Carolina, they taught me that the civil war was due to the Union blockading trade from the South. This isn't something new - it's just brazenly and publicly a \"platform\" for the Republican party for the first time. \n\nWe don't have to destroy history to show the accomplishments of white people. We don't have to negate the truth of what happened - to Africans during slavery, to Native Americans with the Louisiana Purchase, to Japanese during WW2 - to \"spare children's feelings\". \n\nFor the party that cries \"snowflake\" oh so often, they sure get upset easily.",

Everyone gets exactly what they deserve in life. So don't begrudge the wealthy and don't pitty the poor.\"\n\n\"Did you know \"Judeo-Christian morality\" is objectively correct and responsible for literally everything good in the universe? Other faiths are pitiable and wrong and atheists are evil people who just want to get away with sin. Don't be fooled by woke secularism.\"\n\nDid you know that liberals, socialists, and the democratic party are actually responsible for all evil in the universe? They're the original nazis, confederacy, Mongols, Pharoah from the Bible, they made those pants that don't fit you right, they caued you to stub your toe, etc..\"\n\nDid you know that there are only two genders and that women are biologically made to serve men? And men and women are biological made only to marry each other? And anything else is unnatural and evil?\" Here is one random stock graph to prove it. Don't fall for the Marxist gay agenda.\"\n\nSo on and so forth... and I'm not even really exaggerating this stuff, it usually is that hamfisted.\n\nIt's very clear the whole \"university\" shtick is just a gimmic. Just a stupid brand for the channel where he'd upload summaries of his multi hour talk radio episodes. And for a while Prager himself would clearly admit it was a gimmick, but sensing an opportunity he eventually started trying to sell these videos as \"teaching aids\" for conservative teachers who want to push back against the left wing bias of.... non right wing talk radio hosts I guess.\n\nAnd now we've got republican state governments fully endorsing this shit.

At length a mighty hole is dug, and perhaps several Cartloads of Earth thrown out, but alas, no Cag or Iron Pot is found! no Seaman\u2019s Chest cram\u2019d with Spanish Pistoles, or weighty Pieces of Eight! Then they conclude, that thro\u2019 some Mistake in the Procedure, some rash Word spoke, or some Rule of Art neglected, the Guardian Spirit had Power to sink it deeper into the Earth and convey it out of their Reach...\n\"This odd Humour of Digging for Money thro\u2019 a Belief that much has been hid by Pirates formerly frequenting the River, has for several Years been mighty prevalent among us; insomuch that you can hardly walk half a Mile out of Town on any Side, without observing several Pits dug with that Design, and perhaps some lately opened. Men, otherwise of very good Sense, have been drawn into this Practice thro\u2019 an over weening Desire of sudden Wealth, and an easy Credulity of what they so earnestly wish\u2019d might be true.

            "title": "Why John Hattie is wrong, and how to spot an Australian Education Researcher.",
            "selftext": "Hi everyone,\nsaw the post yesterday and thought I'd make a completely new one to give you a rough overview of what the major issues are with John Hattie's \"research\", and when and why it gets trotted out. Sometimes it is well meaning, and sometimes just completely cynical. If you read through to the end I promise you will start to understand why, and how, Australian education policy feels so wrong, and you have \"experts\" telling you things you feel don't work a lot of the time. This is because most of the people conducting this research are the sorts of people who, as my friends dad would put it, \"point at aeroplanes\".\n****\n**Part 1 - \"Meta-Meta-Analysis Fixes Everything\"**\n\nThe major reason I know all this is I first purchased *Visible Learning* when I started teaching after working in sports statistics. Spoiler alert, there is a **LOT** more effort put into the methodology behind sports statistics and analysis, because people gamble on it. There was a line in it along the lines of (not perfect quote) \"even if the individual studies are wrong, by having a meta-analysis, or a meta-meta-analysis (lol) will remove these errors\". This would be only true if:\n\n1. You are doing something which is incredibly predictable, like rolling dice for example.\n\n2. Any errors were \"woopsies\" rather than deliberate misrepresentation or systemic bias.\n\n3. There was no VESTED interest in misrepresenting the data.\n\nOtherwise any meta-analysis will AMPLIFY and systemic bias, and AMPLIFY anything which is regularly measured incorrectly. *Please not, this is a significant amount of it.*\n\n****\n**Part 2 - The Replication Crisis and P-Hacking/Data Dredging**\n\nSo, if you cast your mind back to how the scientific method works, you will recall that you:\n\n1. Have a hypothesis\n2. Eliminate variables\n3. Test the hypothesis\n4. Replicate findings\n\nThat's roughly it for the needs of this. The problem is in a lot of areas this is close to impossible. Most social sciences have difficulty with this, but I'm not dogging them all. It is what it is, as they can't do lab studies. In education, however, this means a free-for-all where none of this is bothered with. *AT ALL!* The standard is incredibly low.\n\nA lot of large scale education research involves grabbing a huge amount of data, then finding things from it. This is terrible practice because with large enough, non-targetted data you can find many patterns which don't exist (coincidences).\n\nAlso, you don't get to write books and do tours if you don't publish, and academic education journals (especially ones in Australia) post things that show big effects, or confirm what is generally believed. The bigger the effect, the more likely you are to be published. \n\nThis is what leads to [\"p-hacking\" or \"data-dredging\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_dredging)  and it is very easy. We used to play this game at an old job where we would cherry pick statistics, or heavily control for certain effects to argue various bog-average players were the Bradman of their sport, or make world-beaters look like they should be dropped. \n\nFor this reason, along with the lack of proper peer-review, we have what is called a [Replication Crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis). This is a problem in many areas of research, but is particularly acute in areas, like education, where you are dealing with things which are more nebulous, and nearly impossible to quantify.  This process further means that this amazing research by the brains trusts at Australian universities [**IS NEVER FUCKING REPLICATED, SO WE DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW BAD IT IS!**](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13803611.2021.2022315). That is a British study, if anyone would is able to find a similar study (even a list of replications) conducted in Australia I would genuinely love to see it. [Here's an article.](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/08/14/almost-no-education-research-replicated-new-article-shows)\n\n****\n**Part 3 - What the Lack of Replication, Combined with Bias Towards Big Effects Means**\n\nEvery study like the ones you do in education have involve chance. Think, a team winning a game, the favourite doesn't always win. If those teams played in the exact same conditions over 1000 games, the favourite would almost certainly win. You can beat the casino in one game, you won't win over a thousand. That is why replication matters.\n\nImagine a group of Education Researchers with 100-sided dice, wanting to find a big number so that they can get published and write a book with a snappy title. They will roll this dice and if it returns less that 95 or so, shut their mouths, because nobody cares (Journals don't usually bother publishing null-results unless they are surprising, sexy, etc, think about \"man bites dog\" as a news story). If they *do* roll 95 or above, they scream it to the high heavens. Nobody rolls the dice again to see if this always happens, it is now just accepted that rolling a 100-sided dice gets you more than 95.\n\n****\n**Part 4 - PUT IT IN THE MATHS MACHINE THAT WILL MAKE LEARN GOOD**\nThis is where John Hattie comes in. A meta-analysis is a powerful tool that has mostly been pioneered in medicine research. It has it's benefits and it does do a good job if the person conducting it knows what they are doing, acts in good faith, and are using research which isn't significantly warped. It doesn't make things **more accurate**, anymore than taking an average makes data **more accurate**. If you watch cricket, think about all the great cricketers with middling averages who stepped up in pressure moments, etc. They only tell a general story, not how good your opponent was, conditions, etc. In research you also need to account for the fact that they are testing different hypotheses, at different rates of accuracy. Like comparing averages and strike rates of batsmen playing fourth drop for a a third rate T20 comp and a Test match opener. You need to be incredibly careful.\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0039368121001849?via%3Dihub\n\n(Paywall) https://www.jclinepi.com/article/0895-4356(94)00110-C/pdf\n\nWikipedia article is quite fair, imo: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis\n\nJohn Hattie was like having an innumerate chainsaw enthusiast attack a pile of numbers. The following is the crowning turd. \n\nhttps://mje.mcgill.ca/article/view/9475/7229\n\nThis is an article written by a statistician who looked at his \"maths\" which was the thing which confirmed many alarm bells at the time. I will present then translate the following:\n\n* **Methodological errors**\n\n*Fundamentally, Hattie\u2019s method is not statistically sophisticated and can be summarized as calculating averages and standard deviations, the latter of which he does not really use. He uses bar graphs (no histograms) and is capable of using a formula that converts a correlation into Cohen\u2019s d (which can be found in Borenstein, Hedges, Higgins, & Rothsten, 2009), without understanding the prerequisites for this type of conversion to become valid. He is guilty of many errors, but his main errors correspond to two of the three major errors in science cited by Allison, Brown, George, and Kaiser (2016) in Nature:*\n\n*1. Miscalculation in meta-analyses*\n\n*2. Inappropriate baseline comparisons*\n\n*His most blatant calculation error is the case of the common language effects (CLE), which take the form of a probability. Noticed in 2012 by Norwegian researchers (Topphol, 2012), it is flagrant to the point of giving negative probabilities or probabilities superior to 100%. Hattie only had to put together a small table (see Table 1) to help the reader (and himself) see the relation between the effect size and CLE.*\n\nSo, the first thing you should note, is that John Hattie has no fucking idea what effect size means. None. An effect size is a number of ways of trying to calculate between two data sets. [This article is quite good at explaining this.](https://visablelearning.blogspot.com/p/effect-size.html) Most of the time, when you calculate an effect, you are in laymans terms finding the difference between doing the thing, and doing nothing. You need a **CONTROL GROUP** to do this properly, because otherwise how the hell do you know what nothing is? John Hattie's \"nothing\" is the middle of his data table, full of inflated results. \n\n**Brace yourself, probabilities greater than 1, and less than 0**\nThis is fucking stupid. There are no other words for it. Think of the chance of someone doing a standing quintuple backflip while juggling three supernovas. The chance of this happening is **FUCKING ZERO**. The chance of rolling a number from 1 to 6 on a standard dice **IS FUCKING 1, ie 100%, you can't not fucking do it!** John Hattie, the brain genius, apparently thought that some things had a chance of somehow nonhappening, multiple times over in the same event. Like, I rolled a 6 sided dice and got two... I don't even know what, it has no way of being thought about. Negative values wouldn't even make sense. This it **YEAR 6 FUCKING PROBABILITY**. \n\nHe is also claiming that, for example you rolled a 6 sided dice **ONCE**, you could get **SOMETIMES OVER 2 RESULTS WITH CERTAINTY**. Like every time you roll you'll get 2.5 *6's*, and 1.5 *un4's* and then a chance of the other stuff.\n\nIf you think of a probability table, it always adds to 1 (ie 100% as a decimal). Coin Flip:\n\nHeads | Tails | Total\n-----|-----|-----\n0.5 | 0.5 | 1\n\nDice roll:\n\n\n1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | Total\n-|-|-|-|-|-|-----\n0.167 | 0.167 | 0.167 | 0.167 | 0.167 | 0.167 | 100\n\n*Total off by a touch due to rounding repeating decimals, every one is 1/6.*\n\n**He Spreads Pseudoscience, then Lectures Teachers About Knowing Their Students**\n\nThis is John Hattie's [*Visible Learning and Effect Size Tool, lol. Excel file, btw.*](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwij6dD378KAAxXSZPUHHXJ2DzsQFnoECBoQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.visiblelearning.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2FVisible%2520Learning%2520Progress%2520and%2520achievement%2520tool_0.xlsm&usg=AOvVaw18lg0PwuObb8zg0OlUX0KL&opi=89978449)\n\nThis apparently measure the \"effect size\" in terms of **years growth** for anything! Teaching rocketry to PHD students? Are you trying to get children to remember numbers 1-10? This will tell you how many years growth you have achieved. The Magic number is 0.4, apparently one years growth. I made a table where 10 students got 20 on a pretest (out of what and on what, who gives a shit poindexter, a year is a year). The second time, they all got 40 except for 1 kids because the calculator returns a null result for identical changes. the kids who went from 20 to 40 achieved a score of **132.66**, the genius who got 41 got 139.3. bear in mind ones years growth is less than half of 1, and you begin to see how much I have achieved.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/bTMl50P\n\nHere's another one, let's say you are teaching 10 kids, and you give them a test on words in Ancient Hebrew. They know none of them. You proceed to teach 9 of them 1 word in Ancient Hebrew on the test, and another kid 2 words because otherwise the calculator stops working.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/JUxAXfk\n\nCongratulations, On the child who now knows two, you have given them over 33 years growth in Ancient Hebrew and may make them a Rabbi. The other, stupider children had the meager growth of 16.5 years growth. Back to Rabbi school for them.\n\nThis is taking the calculator to the extreme level, not because that is what he advocates, but to show how fundamentally stupid it is. If you got two years growth out of a C student every year from Prep/Kindy to Year 6, they should be able to sit the HSC and get a sound mark at the end of it. That is not how learning, or the brain, works. The reason this calculator is stupid is that to calculate an effect size you need a **CONTROL GROUP**. How many words did students taking the same course learn? \n\n**Other Points**\n\nThese are just some, that I can tell you with any manner of accuracy. There are others:\n\n1. Some psychology researchers have pointed out that the insane effects he is claiming are essentially saying that he can take a child with an IQ below 75, and within a few short years have them operating at a university level IQ. Basically he can cure the cognitive effects of Downs Syndrome.\n\n2. His claim that students who are smarter should be learning *faster* is shows a fundamental misunderstanding of how the brain works. Similary to this: If you were to train an Olympic gold medalist 100m runner and an obese person who has not participated in sport previously, whose time do you think you could improve by the highest amount? Exponential growth has a limit, that's why companies like Google don't double in size as fast a small start ups can.\n\n**Conclusions**\nThere is also the problem that he dodges all of this. He has pulled his numbers, claimed to have fixed them, and said when he did it nothing changed. The numbers are FUNDAMENTALLY THE SAME. Fucking HOW? Can we see it? No.\n\nHe further uses shifty language to ignore the central point: He got famous by throwing a table of values out there. They are completely wrong. He now tries to handwave away criticism by saying people are using it wrong because that is how he is presenting it!!! He is using it to sell books, speaking tours and get cushy Department of Education gigs to justify large class sizes and administration in the form of pointless PL on things which don't work.\n\nHe has never shown his work fixed, with actually mathematical rigor. He's never had to face a proper please explain (the conspiracy theorist in me says because he said that governments shouldn't worry about class size). All his \"new\" numbers are hidden away, but we are assured they are fixed and nothing meaningfully changed. \n\nYou cannot perform a statistical analysis of any size, let alone over 50,000 varying studies, without understanding probability, and anyone who thinks that negative probability exists would fail a Stage 3 chance test. \n\nHis quackery is so far beyond the pale that if he did it in an area that people gave a shit about, like sports gambling or finance, he would be immediately fired. If he had run his numerology to show that small class sizes (ie expensive to government and private interests) were the most important thing, he would have been immediately discredited by the IPA, Business Council, etc. He showed the opposite, so he doesn't need to answer to anyone, and every cost cutting government will give him a gig when he wants it. \n\nI'll leave you with some laymans tidbits from Pierre-J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bergeron's article quoted above called *HOW TO ENGAGE IN PSEUDOSCIENCE WITH REAL DATA: A CRITICISM OF JOHN HATTIE\u2019S ARGUMENTS IN VISIBLE LEARNING FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF A STATISTICIAN *\n\nIf you, or someone you know has been taken in by this numerology, [please read this whole article in full.](https://mje.mcgill.ca/article/view/9475/7229) You don't even need to know high school statistics to understand that he fails at every single hurdle or mathematical rigor. He simply has an appalling understanding of pre-algebra, for starters, and not ability to conceptualise what he is doing when he puts numbers into excel. He is the equivalent of a 5 year old with a calculator.\n\n>Unfortunately, in reading Visible Learning and subsequent work by Hattie and his team, anybody who is knowledgeable in statistical analysis is quickly disillusioned. Why? Because data cannot be collected in any which way nor analyzed or interpreted in any which way either. Yet, this summarizes the New Zealander\u2019s actual methodology. To believe Hattie is to have a blind spot in one\u2019s critical thinking when assessing scientific rigor. To promote his work is to unfortunately fall into the promotion of pseudoscience. Finally, to persist in defending Hattie after becoming aware of the serious critique of his methodology constitutes willful blindness. \n________________________________________________\n>The effect of class size (under the \u201csignificant\u201d bar according to Visible Learning, which is 0.4) is positive and we suppose that we are comparing small classes to larger classes (smaller classes have greater academic success). We could have compared larger classes to smaller ones, and the effect would have been negative (larger classes are less successful than smaller ones), and Hattie\u2019s interpretation (class size does not have a significant impact) would be completely different, since a negative impact is considered to be harmful.\n________________________________________________\n>Basically, Hattie computes averages that do not make any sense. A classic example of this type of average is: if my head is in the oven and my feet are in the freezer, on average, I\u2019m comfortably warm.\n________________________________________________\n>The examples above describe but a small fraction of the fundamental reasoning errors found in Visible Learning. We could spend ages dissecting each meta-analysis, evaluating to which extent there are calculation and interpretation errors, and describing the actual limits of the original analyses. There is also a lack of space to explain the complexity and subtleties of proper modeling of intervention effects calculated from different observational or experimental studies, including questions on dose-effect relationships, geographic locations, and time. All of this is completely lost when one decides to reduce everything to one single number, because it is insufficient to represent reality.\n________________________________________________\n>In summary, it is clear that John Hattie and his team have neither the knowledge nor the competencies required to conduct valid statistical analyses. No one should replicate this methodology because we must never accept pseudoscience. This is most unfortunate, since it is possible to do real science with data from hundreds of meta-analyses.\n________________________________________________\n>Statistics and modern data science offer an array of rigorous tools that allow for a better understanding of collected data and to extract useful and applicable conclusions. It goes without saying that the development of the education system must be analyzed in a scientific manner, and for this, the solution remains the same as the one proposed by Fisher many decades ago (cited in Allison et al., 2016): we must consult with a statistician before data collection. And during data collection. And after. But mostly, at each step of the study. We cannot allow ourselves to simply be impressed by the quantity of numbers and the sample sizes; we must be concerned with the quality of the study plan and the validity of collected data.\n\n>For this, we must call upon experienced statisticians who will know how to keep a watchful eye and to think critically. Every self-respecting university offers a statistics consultation service to support scientific research. It is also possible to obtain these services from private companies or consultants. There is no reason why faculties of education should not call upon such services. It is imperative to do so, because, as we have seen in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, the consequences of choosing the wrong Grail are tragic.",

Education research can be good, but it's mostly bogus. I guess there's a reason why teachers speak about unis and academics with a lot of disdain.",

A good educator will take aspects from Hattie's research, and from other researchers, and apply it to their particular situation. It's not just Hattie - I remember when I did my placement, the new principal at one of the schools absolutely worshipped the work of Carol Dweck - and again, there is a lot of merit to her work, but you can't just blindly follow the recommendations of one researcher when it may not necessarily be best applied to your situation. \n\nAlso thank you for putting this analysis together, it's incredible!",

Nope, you want to learn what you want to learn of course.\n\nIts why talented and gifted students are given simple questions that allow the possibility of complex answers, so their intelligence can manifest itself. Its not the answer to the question that matters per se, its how its answered. The idea then is to try and steer that rare intelligence into and through established frameworks of education."

            "selftext": "When I was a kid I went to an elementary school in Brazil for a little bit. I remember that every day was essentially a minimum day. School started around noon and ended around 4. As a little kid I just thought that this was because Brazil was cooler than the US. \n\nNow that I am older I\u2019ve heard that the reason why this was was because many schools in Brazil just lack the resources to function properly, like a lack of teachers or something. My question is. Are shortened school days common around Brazil and is it really because there isn\u2019t enough teachers and stuff?",

                "It depends on whether it\u2019s private or public and it\u2019s improved a lot since you were a kid heheh. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen a school do 4-hour school days.",
                "depends a lot.\n\nin my time at school it was common for schools to have 2 shifts per day: morning (7am-noon) and afternoon ( 1pm to 6pm ). it was common in both private and public schools.\n\nyou would choose to go school only in the morning or only in the afternoon.\n\n I always studied in the morning. but I remember having friends that studied in the afternoon.",
                "I think what you are reffering to is what we call \"Ensino Integral\" wich is when you spend both the mornings and the afternoons at school. It happens here, but it's no the norm.\n\nUsually the kids go to school either in the morning, from 7ish am till 12ish, OR in the afternoons from 1:30ish PM till 5:30is PM. That will give you 5 or 6 classes everyday. \n\nIt has nothing to do with resources or funding, even some of the most posh private schools work this way. For us it's stranger to see a kid going to school the whole day.",
                "Don't know what you're talking about, when I was in public school (about 40 years ago), class started at 7:30 and ended at noon.",
                "Teacher, Coordinator here. I worked with \"full-time education\" for half a decade, coordinating 4 schools in my city (from budget to hire teachers, tutor students, buy materials, food, etc).  \n\n\nFirst, there's no \"shortened school day\" for one simple reason: a full day is not our standard. However, we often try to extend the period from part-time to full-time through special programs, like [Mais Educa\u00e7\u00e3o](https://teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/48/48134/tde-17122014-103428/en.php).Some of the reasons that could help explain why we can't guarantee a full-time education in our country:\n\n1. Lack of resources - this is the main issue, but not the only one;\n2. Mindset;\n3. Working culture - departments of education struggle to guarantee the teacher's schedule, which could mean shorten the working hours with students or extend the time teachers spend in the building + pay accordingly, without being unfair or unlawful + hire more people/teacher/tutors;\n4. Families and social dynamics - much of our school's structure (society, to be fair) are built to be functioning with traditional Work and Job hours, so we will need a huge change in things like transportation, for example. In many US cities, families pay nannies/sitters/caregivers to fill the gaps... Here, this is luxury.\n5. Weather - counts, but you could fix the issue with resources. I personally canceled school days due to heat or heavy rain.\n\n\\----\n\nOf course, this is public school. There's private institutions working with full-time periods without issues. Also, there's also public schools doing the same. In general, we face many problems (as cited above). Money is our biggest problem, that's for sure. But a huge change like going from part-time to full-time in a State or even Federal scale will not work only with a raise of budget.",
                "Studied in private schools all my life, that's the normal duration. Generally means kids' parents have enough money to have kids taken care of while they work, so the school doesn't need to hold the kids the entire day.",
                "I study in a good private school and have 4/5-hour school days, it's a common thing.\n\nSchool time isn't proportional to education quality btw, look at Finland",
                "We dont need no education\n\nWe dont need thought Control\n\nNo dark sarcasm in the classroom",
                "Where I'm at in MG school is split 7am to 11am for the older kids and 12:30pm to 4:50pm for the younger ones, both public and private. I think there are some options for full-day but it's not the norm in our region.",
                "This thread is weird. Yeah I know some schools who would have 6h school days but most schools I know of are 4h days, starting at 8am/13pm and ending 12pm/18pm, just as generalization. They would make cuts on class timing, intervals or change the time the classes started. For example, my elementary school used to start at 7h30am, but then they changed it for 8am. Class time used to be between 45min to 1h and intervals were cut in half if I remember correctly\n\nI live at Porto Alegre, RS",
                "It\u2019s because Brazil is in fact much cooler than the US. Not because of resources, Brazilians do a lot without resources everyday.",
                "Thats regional, most if not all public schools in my state are full day schools, the school day starts at 7:30am and goes to 5pm. The school also provides 3 free meals, this is important because in some rural villages some kids can eat only one or two meals a day its another reason for teenagers not to abandon their education to become cheap labor.",
                "Lack of teachers and space. To accommodate as many students as possible, half of them have classes in the morning and the other half in the afternoon. Some schools have classes at night for older students (16-18) that might have jobs during the day.\n\nBrazil never changed this model because it would require all schools to double the amount of classrooms and teachers in the entire country.\n\nSome schools have been trying to change into full day classes but they are still rare.",
                "they typically have smaller school buildings so splitting school day between younger and older students makes more sense for the space.. \n\nBut from my memory it's closer to 8-1pm and 1pm to 6pm.. so a good 5 hours which is pretty close to US system that is like 6 hours with a 1 hour lunch break/recess.\n\nand of course there are after/before school programs...highschool students go to class in the morning and then might study a language in afternoon or whatever..",
                "It's not really that they lack money, it's just that that's how it works here. The 7-12, or 1-6 routine is the conventional schedule schools organize their curriculum around.\n\n I'm not sure about the history of that, maybe it is the case that it became the most popular format because of a lack of resources like you say. But the schools themselves I can tell you with a good amount of certainty are not choosing to have shorter days in what would otherwise follow a US-style 9-4 (what we call \"integral/full time schooling\") model.\n\nThere are schools that follow the longer model, and in fact, just a little while ago this year, a bill to expand the amount of students in full time public schools by 1 million got approved, but I think even still to this day most schools will have separate morning and afternoon schedules that different grades will attend. Out of 4 schools I went to, 2 of them being private, just one public school worked with a full time curriculum",
                "In Brazil we don't adopt the integral sistem in the elementary  school because studys prove that in this stage of life the child is forming the bond with family... So keep her in the school for a vast time is detrimental for her/his personal formation.\n\nYou will find the integral school in the elementary Years just in private schools. \n\nAnd more, here in Brazil we follow the European method of schooling, but there's a moviment to addere the American method.",
                "1- School needs to be full-time in the US cause daycare costs a fortune, and child protection services wouldn't allow children to spend half of the day unattended.\n\n2- In Brazil, babysitters cost pennies, grandparents are more willing to care for their grandchildren, and the child protection service is almost non-existent.\n\n\nThe issue has little to do with education quality and resources since the best and most expensive private schools in Brazil don't necessarily go full-time.",
                "I love seeing people suggarcoating thr situation and trying to portray the education in Brazil as 'good'. Lol",
                "Well, my friend,  I'm a mother of 3 , and before my kids estudied abroad, I was the crazy mother at school in Brazil.  \nAll started when a teacher send a homework , saying to find in a paragraph some words. \nAnd there are no paragraph. \nSo, I perceived that our teachers sometimes don't have the bare minimum to teach. Especially at inicial years. That's so sad. \nTe quality of public schools changes from place to place. It depends on administration. p\nWe don't have homeschooling,  and adaptation to sistem must be done.\nI can talk  for hours non stop about education, but there are no one to listen. \nPoliticians ask for women in politics, but don't give 8 hours to us. We work for 8.They are at schools for 4 or 5 hours /day. So no women with kids aren't free in this country, always dependent upon one to care about de infant, because of the disparity about hours/day to both, parents and children. \nI think that you got the picture. Reading the curriculum bases of education,  I found that the content are similar in volume and competences than other countries,  but in 4 hours, it is impossible to learn all content. For sure. \nMy kids learn the same \"volume \" of content in 8 hours. And learned. At 4 hours, fixes nothing in the mind. There's no time for a kid to learn.\nAnd what a teacher says about? Nothing. They don't have knowledge to see how a teacher is formed in England,  for example. They fight everyday to be at workplace. They buy things from their  own pockets to give a small gift tho their kids at class. \nAnd the paycheck of teacher says it all. \nSo, if your country have homeschooling,  bring it, because we don't know the future of our kids. I did coming back to Brazil,  enrolled at the end of the year just to finish the basic years in Brazil,  to both of my kids.( I don't recommend either,  this practice is exhausting to the kids) \nSo, welcome,  I hope that all come to a reality smoothly,  and you and your family be happy here. \nHugs.",
                "Several comments suggarcoating the situation. To sum up:\n\n- Lack of resources, teacher shortage and poor quality. \n\nAmerica is not among the best education systems, but it is far superior than Brazil in that regard. \n\nYes, in America there are extra curricular activities, and someone put 'in Brazil parents prefer doing it at home'. Buuuuuuuulsh*t. Parents are not professionals, and not every neighborhood has infrestructure for sports, music, etc. I doubt even 30% of kids have classes with actual professionals. \n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=-bzuW6osFOs",
                "As of my personal experience, most public schools had 4:30h/day(07:00 to 11:30 or 13:00 to 17:30) until 2019, mostly due to the lack of infrastructure in less developed/smaller areas.\n\n But since then the government is changing its system to \"tempo integral\", and even building bigger schools(one started working in my city last year)\n\n\nAnd the whole high school(the 3 last grades) was restructured with the project \"novo ensino m\u00e9dio\"\nAlthough this project was not as successful as they thought, so they are re-restructuring it lol\n\n\nIs it better now? I can't say, my school is not integral, and I'm not in high school yet",
                "the usual i see is around 4 hours\n\ni studied in private schools from early 90s to mid 2000s, my younger brother from late 2000s until late 2010s, other friends and family members, we all did on average 4hrs and a bit\n\none 20 min pause for eating, playing etc right in the middle",
                "Normal time is around 4 hours and 30 minutes. You probably had school from 13:00 to 17:25. It doesn't feel short for us, at least for me it used to be an eternity. But I just googled it and apparently many countries have the whole day, that's wild, how do these kids get time to do things they want, like swimming or learning a new language or an instrument?",
                "whaat? no.. at any age, in most schools the kids study half period only...",
                "When i was 10 i stayed on school at least 6 hours plus 1 hour of basketball and swimming 2 times a week each. It was a private school.\n\nMaybe you spent less time there because your parents choose to.",
                "School time is not full time like in the us. It\u2019s early in the morning OR in the afternoon. Always \n\nThe part of lack of funding is about some public schools but even fully funded schools don\u2019t have a full time program if they are not international",
                "Both of my kids started school at 7 and would be released from classes by 12 at the latest. Then there were extra curricular activities like music, capoeira, etc. Older kids like what would be middle school in the US started at noon and would be done before 5. This was a public school in our very rural vila.",
                "School days are generally from 7:30-8:00 to 12:00 - 12:30 and 12:30 - 13:00 to 17:00-17:30. It is supposed to be 5 hours, but it really depends on the place and school.\nWhen I was a kid, Friday was a half day (elementary school), so 3 hours. That practice seems to have died out.\nIt could have to do with lack of resources and overpopulation, but I am not certain. But, it has gotten much better, we do have full day schools now and assistance for special needs kids.",
                "When I was a kid in S\u00e3o Paulo, my public school (and I think most of them) had 4 hour turns, so they could fit 3 different classes along the day: 7-11am, 11-3pm, 3-7pm. Some schools had supplementary classes for adults from 7pm to 11pm. Public education was a notorious crap back then, so the efforts have been directed over the years to turn public schools into full-time schools.",
                "I went to a private high school and we had the same time amount in class as you did. It's because we don't make school the center of kids' lives and thus don't have as many electives and school activities as in the States.",
                "You're wrong and biased. It's not that Brazil lack the resources and funding for schools, it is because the schooling system is different. That's it.\nUS schools focus not only in academics but also in after school activities, clubs, sports, arts, etc. In Brazil it is only school.\n\nI studied abroad in the US for a year in college and was shocked by some really basic questions some students would ask. Some were things that we learn on year 7-8 in Brazil (at ages 14-15) and they didn't know. That's because in the US you can choose the classes you take in high school so some students just don't know basic things about everything because they didn't take some classes and in Brazil everyone studies the same things. We at least know the basics of everything when we get to college.\n\nOf course, private and public schools are vastly different and students from private schools are better prepared for college, know more things in dept and etc, but every school HAS to teach the same things, following the Federal Government Guidelines for Junior, Elementary and High school.",
                "It\u2019s just a different time schedule. Less hours a day, more days with classes",
                "BTW, Brasil is away cooler than US.",
                "Usually school ranges from 1pm to 5:30pm at that age \nThen it goes to 7am to 12am when you get older.",
                "Mine started at 7 AM and would end at 1 pm. \n\nIt was like that all the way until the very last grade when we start prepping for the college admission exams. Then school would be from 7 am to 7 PM . \n\nIt was a private school.\n\nIt was a pretty good school with plenty of teachers so I'm pretty sure lack of resources was not the reason. Its just not common to have kids at school for so long. The school did have extra curricular activities and those were at noon so I suppose if you wanted to join one you'd be at school for a longer period.",
                "When my now wife was in high school and i was in Brazil visiting she would go to school at 7am and finish at 12pm (this was a private school)",
                "Ok, lets go into a bit of history\n\nLong time ago (when my 60 years old mom was in school) the few public schools were very good, but they existed in very small quantities, concentrated in rich/middle class neighborhoods and a small percentage of the kids had access...\n\nSomewhere around the 80's the government started to universalize it, trying to give 100% of the kids at least some form of education.\n\nOf course the money wasn't enough to build and maintain this expansion, so for some decades it was absolute chaos, even the old good schools suffered a lot with cuts in budget.\n\nThis last decade (with some hiccups) at least a lot of the buildings and infrastructure is done (but still not complete), so the budget is being transferred again on the \"maintain\" mode, so the number of teachers is slowly expanding, qualification is getting better etc.\n\nSo lets say that probably your memories are from this chaotic expansion period that is slowly getting more organized.",
                "I studied in priv all my life and... 6 hrs of class + more classes after lunch until 5pm(the ones after lunch u dont NEED to go but it counts as a class)",
                "I'm a high school teacher, we start working at 06:40AM and end up 11:05AM. And yes, we lack resources, like textbooks...",
                "states public schools, atleast in my experience starde at like 13:30 and ended 5:30\n\nor 7:30 and ended 11:30\n\nsomething around those times, there is also a night time, but i dont remember",
                "That's depend and changes considerably. I had all my education in the S\u00e3o Paulo's state public system, and the elementary shifts were between 7 to 11 AM and 1 to 4 PM; 1st to 4th grade was up to noon and 5 PM, and then from 5th to 8th grade was only between 1 and 6 PM. On high schools, there were shifts between 7 to noon and between 7 and 11 PM. On college, the shifts were even more varied.\n\nWhen I was a kid, there were also schools with only one shifts, from 7 AM to 3 PM, all from 1st to 8th grade and when I went to college, the high schools started with this system too. The general rule was: pre-1st grade is on one school, then 1st to 4th grade is on another school, and usually from 5th to 8th grade and high school on another one (these ranges separed by shifts to not mix the ages and prevent bullying, for example).\n\nThe thing is: there was always at least 40 students in the same room, designed for no more than 25 students; sometimes were even more than 50. And these schools are pretty much like prisons in which you can't go anywhere once you entered, only after the shift. The result is a sea of kids and adolescents with some teacher drowning in them.\n\nSomehow the things work. The difference is very clear once you get into college.",
                "It varies a lot on the region. I only have been on public schools, and at elementary school we got home early at least 2 times a week. On the high school, we got home early almost everyday.",
                "It isn't about lack of resources, it's that we don't feel the need to have our kids endure such long hours of study",
                "I speak for public schools mostly. They were very very common up until about a few years ago, when they implemented \"integral\" which became living hell for students in the start. And still is hell for them. I believe it is 8 or 9 hours when they implemented it (I was lucky to be in highschool during this time). \n\nNot only does it annoy the students, it disturbs smaller rural cities. The city I grew up in was very rural, with only 20k population in total. Majority of the students were working and helping their family businesses and farms. The afternoon classes were perfect, which allowed them to work in the morning, study in the afternoon (when they would have been napping and taking a break), then whatever else is needed, settling things, putting whatever away, etc. Now that it's longer, a large portion of my school actually ended up quitting and refused to show up due to the schedule.\n\nIt's an amazing idea for bigger cities such as SP or BH that are urban and very populated. But the state forces all schools to follow the same rules (excluding schools ran by the city)."

For example, in May in Cherkasy, law enforcement officers detained the director of the Cherkasy Vocational Lyceum , who was enrolling men who, according to the law, received deferments from mobilization. Despite their status as students, the men did not attend classes and returned the stipend they received to the director and his accomplices.",

The enhancing of physical attributes through the insertion of artificial limbs, organs, and chemical enhancements into one's body.\n\nThis process is extremely diverse, ranging from a simple increase in durability via Veranite-infused bones, to entire bodies reconstructed with Artifical arms, legs, and skeletal structures.\n\nSome groups oppose such transhumanism, such as the radical \"Blackwatch\" group, but all in all, most see it as a natural progression of science.",

Three \"races\" exist in this world and worked to rebuild it: humans (same as normal, except everyone has one of a few forms of magic), chimeras (essentially humans with a few physical animal traits), and dragons (humanoid reptiles around the size of train cars with wings and ice magic, which is unique to them).\n\nIt is split into three countries: On the west side of the continent lies the Kingdom of Gaela, founded by the \"Goddess of Darkness\" Eclipse, and populated about equally by humans and chimeras. On the east side of the continent lies the Kingdom of Fierte, founded by the \"Goddess of Light\" Solaris, with a similarly split population which developed more advanced technology due to the lesser average magical prowess of their citizens compared to Gaela. To the north of these countries lies the Yarostian Empire, a frozen tundra founded and populated almost exclusively by dragons. Additionally, a small island called Perdix sits in the Carved Sea separating Fierte and Gaela, unclaimed by any nation, and populated by a mix of people with nowhere else to call home who use strange technology far more advanced than anything the other countries have to offer.\n\n(BTW, since you said you'll be in-character as someone from your world, should I respond in-character as someone from my world?

A major character found that spaceship and read its central computer, which, by some miracles, was still operable and learnt about our demise as a species. She called us dumbasses. Yet her country packs *planet-killers* on cruisers no bigger than the Richelieu.\n\nOn another note, Medvedev was Russia's president in 2022 instead of Putin and he starved Ukraine's economy by building a new pipeline through Turkey, all the while maintaining the status quo and leaving NATO in a disarray debating its reason for existing.",

                "I like nomadic people's, I also like the salt road and scifi, so now we got tribes in space. \n\nAfter leaving the gravity well many cultures and tribal people persisted with the most notable of these groups being the nomadic Kadeshi. With white hair, red eyes, and skin tones which range from pale to gray these 'humans' were not suited to the nomadic lifestyle they lived on the desert planet, and much of their lore speaks of them being a people from the stars. This has caused many gynecologists to look into their genetic record and discover many artifacts in their DNA which suggest they are an off-shoot of humanity which got slowly absorbed into the population similar to how Neanderthals were in our world.\n\nNonetheless after over a hundred years since the age of space travel began, and slower than light starships have spread humanity to other stars, the Kadeshi nomads remain. As passed down by their elders now plugged directly into ship systems, the Kadeshi people are to roam the stars in search of the great song of the universe.\n\nThis style of living almost perpetually on spaceships with low gravity have made Kadeshi excellent pilots, mechanics, and soldiers in 0g environments with many innovations into sustainable ship and life-support technology being invented by them.\n\nOther than that, the Kadeshi are usually discriminated against for making technology that doesn't have planned obsolescence involved, and heralded as genius engineers for the same reason. They often wear metal plates inlaid directly into their skin, often welcome new peoples into their tribe which has led to a large amount of reformed pirates and gangsters being in their number by using their diplomatic sway to avoid prison.",

However, artificial stars known as Cradle Stars were found as early as the 1200s, and it wasn't until centuries later that the technology to investigate the inside of these stars were developed, only to reveal a megastructure containing impossibly ancient artifacts, dating *older* than the known universe. \n\nDecades were poured into researching these primordial technologies, the most notable ones being Prometheans. They are best described as large, mostly humanoid exoskeletons entirely composed of self-replicating machines the size of *quarks.* Only a few of these were able to be activated and used through a physical and neural connection, each one with their specific individual: their \"chosen\" pilots. It was discovered that these Prometheans also have their own sentience and can operate independently.

However the largest groups of Native Martians are the \u00d1\u00e1za, who are spread across the North, the \u00d3chi \u00c1nthropoi, who are mostly around the South East of Mars and who adopted Greek Culture and Language (including converting to the Orthodox Church) and the \u012an\u014d, who are Nomadic. \n\nThe largest Human Martian Cultures would be the Astronautes, descended from French Colonies, the Chavic descended from British Colonies and are mixed Welsh, Northern Irish, Scottish, English, Cornish and Manx in origin, the Hombres Estrellas descended from Spanish Colonies and the Ummat al-Marikh, descended from Saudi Colonies.\n\nMars itself is filled with lots Realms from small Counties to large Empires, and a very small amount of Realms are either successor States to Martian Colonies or, even if using different names, are the Martian Colonies outright such as the Republic of New Dijon in the South (now just called Dijon because most People don\u2019t even know there\u2019s a Dijon on Earth).\n\nReligions have gotten weird as things from Earth have became misinterpreted due to the lack of context surrounding them, such as the descendants of the Americans, the Columbians, worshipping the Founding Fathers as Gods and using the US Constitution, or the French who\u2019s largest Religion, R\u00e9volutionnarisme, outright worships Robespierre and Madame Guillotine. The largest Religions brought over from Earth is Hellenism which slowly took over the Human Greek Population, intern founding the Kingdom of Olympus and expelling the remaining Orthodox Martians and Humans out of the Realm, Haredi Judaism, with the largest Haredi Realm, the Duchy of Haifa, ruled by House Rothschild. Islam also managed to gain popularity and now most of the South is dominated by Wahhabism and a Caliphate, the Abdullah Caliphate.

Known amongst the people aware of it as the Shrine of the Untamable, it was built during the early days of the Illumina Empire by a young, ambitious Maishomian entrepreneur-architect named Endecall that sought to be the first to settle Sareia\u2019s Moon and possibly mine the satellite for its rich metals.\n\nHe commissioned a Jasean rocket company using a significant sum of Zirco he stole from his wealthy uncle to build a small ship for one living individual and seven artificial lifeforms. He also approached a small Decatensae factory, relatively new tech at the time, and commissioned a series of mining-specialized androids that were protected from acid. He calculated his course while the ships were being built while his tools were being constructed.\n\nHis uncle nearly put the kibosh on the whole thing when it was about 40% complete, but Endecall was undeterred. While he was being served a Cease and Desist, he made a doorway pitch to his uncle that it was an investment and that he had a plan to split the revenue 50/50 with his uncle. Unfortunately for him, his uncle was bloody ruthless in business, and whittled Endecall\u2019s share down to a paltry 12% finder\u2019s commission without ownership rights while waving the CnD around like a drunk wrecking ball operator on LSD in Manhattan. Endecall was also forced to concede naming rights and colonial control to his uncle and pay him a 2-zirco \u201clesson fee.\u201d\n\nThe empty shrine was ultimately the only part of the colony that was built. An errant acid splash destroyed most of the engine and a good chunk of the hold that housed the Decatensae on landing approach. This left only one Decatensa and Endecall. They salvaged enough material to build that shrine, finishing just as a massive quake shook their region, sending a massive acid tsunami crashing into their landmass and sweeping the shuttle, Endecall, the supplies, and the Decatensa away while dissolving them into nothing.\n\nFour others have tried since.

Soon, humans came to the island and settled there, which then lead to sentient animals that became anthropomorphic, and a new city made of robots. The planet that lentodia takes place in has a giant powerful eldritch dragon creature named Imova that sleeps within it, and one of its scales became dragon ridge, a place where a lot of dragons live.

It would not be until the 1700s when the idea of it being it manifesting as a full-fledged country would come in to play, leading to a divide between the so-called \"modern fathers\" of Marakovanism; Vincent Staarman and Klaus van Ophemert.\n\nOphemert, a Dutch noble, reportedly had a \"dream\" that a meteor was coming to Earth so he consulted a close friend, an astronomer named Vincent Staarman. They predicted when it would land on Earth and they were the first to find it, discovering its unearthly powers and sought to use it for their own gain, manipulated by the alien concept of \"Marakova\". However, human nature had taken over and the two were divided by their beliefs; Ophemert sought to establish his own empire using this valuable but extremely powerful energy, meanwhile Staarman believed that this was a biblical sign of the coming of days and humanity should be subservient to their other-worldly overlords. Staarman was murdered, however his consciousness lived on as a puppet of these unknown extraterrestrials, meanwhile Ophemert managed to live long enough to figure out how to extend his life with this energy, so much so he lived to see the Russian Revolution unfold.  \n\n\nAnd when the Russian Revolution finally happened that was the (at the time) small group of Marakovans to take over, the Bolsheviks assassinated the Romanovs, and the Marakovans assassinated the Bolsheviks. Instead of the USSR, we got Marakova.  \n\n\nThousands of years of bloodshed over intangible energy that is ultimately rare even in the infinite expanse of the universe, likely only existing not as an actual resource sought by these unseen alien invaders but as some form of weapon.

            "selftext": " **Rewatch sessions #54**:\n\n* **Title: Sex Education**\n* **Network:** Netflix\n* **Released:** 2019\n* **Genre:** Sex-comedy; Teen-drama\n* **Stream:** Netflix\n\nNow, it's been awhile since I've done a show that I didn't really like on first viewing for this *write-up series*. I didn't expect to like it any more than I did the first time around either, so I knew what I was getting into jumping back into Sex Education. I don't have disdain towards the show, I watched it for what it is, and at certain points even enjoyed it for what it is, but given that it is a highly rated show by critics and one widely beloved by viewers, my opinion is that Sex Education is, for lack of a better term, is *overrated*.\n\nOff the bat, I have to give Sex Education praise for certain aspects of its production, specifically setting and costumes. It's actually set in modern day UK, but its retro aesthetics which can be seen in fashion, decors and sets, gives the series a 80s/90s high school movie vibe. It's an intriguing blend 80s/90s style amongst modern technologies, and though this aspect becomes less noticeable in the latter seasons, it is one of the more unique things about this show. Another unique thing is the premise itself. Sex Education is a sex comedy where an erotophobic virgin boy with a sex therapist mother, Otis, and a misfit outcast who's strap for cash, Maeve, start up secret sex therapy clinic at their sex rampant high school to help students and make money. But, my issues with the series begins with this premise, or to be more specific, it's handling of it, especially in the first season. \n\nOtis is good at talking to people *like* a therapist, but given his naivety and his own sexual troubles, it is clear from just watching the first episode that Otis shouldn't be giving advice on sex to *anyone*, yet alone gullible teenagers. That is fine in theory, but the issue is the show doesn't make it convincing enough that it is self-aware of that. Interesting sexual topics and conflicts are brought up, but in a lot of cases the show takes a left turn, gloss over any technicalities of said sexual conflict, and introduces some underlying emotional issue, basically saying \"*hey, this is the real cause of the problem!*\" For instance, in the very first episode, Otis' first patient is one with a *strong gag reflex*, and after a lot of dilly dallying, near the end of the episode, Otis sits down with her and asks \"why do you feel you have to give your boyfriend blowjobs?\" before the scene fades out. We didn't need more than that to know where that conversation was heading, or how it ended even, but what if the girl had said she wanted to give her boyfriend blowjobs as it's something she enjoys doing herself... how could Otis have helped her? He couldn't, he doesn't have that kind of knowledge. \n\nIt's even worse when Otis watches porn or uses a simple search engine to try and treat a patient... which raises the question 'why the patients, who are suppose to be computer literate teenagers, couldn't just do that themselves?' I guess if you want to suspend your disbelief you could tell yourself that having a sex therapist for a mother gives Otis just enough knowledge to discard all the bullshit you can find online? But the show doesn't doesn't send that point across. Another case of the show lacking self-awareness, is in the 4th episode when Otis' advice to a lesbian couple, who were initially shown scissoring but having a major lack of sexual chemistry, seems to be... *get better at scissoring*? 'Scissoring' can be a complicated way to have lesbian sex. It takes a lot of time to get right, and sometimes it just can't be done depending on the body types involved. So if a lesbian couple is having a lack of chemistry in the bedroom, the obvious advice would be to... *fuckin' do anything else*! It's ok for the teen characters, especially Otis, to not know this, but the issue is, the show gives no rebuttal on that issue. Again, it takes a left turn and the underlying conflict is that the couple never wanted to be together in the first place. Even if that's the case, that alone wouldn't stop sex from being enjoyable... (*I mean, once you do anything else but fucking scissoring that is*). And another instance of this show seemingly not understanding how lesbian sex works, is in the 2nd season when another lesbian couple can't have sex together because one has vaginismus and can't be penetrated... YOU DON'T NEED PENETRATION TO HAVE LESBIAN SEX! How is this series written by mostly women!?\n\nIn regards to all the issues I raised, season 2 is better. Though Otis never really faces any consequences or repercussions for his actions, putting his actual sex therapist mother in a similar situation that he was in, made things more convincing without the writers having to change the way they went about doing things. It also gets a bit better at giving actual *sex education*, and the writing does less diverging from the sexual issues at hand. But one issue continued to plague Sex Education in season 2, with even more damning effect... BORING STORYTELLING! Besides a couple, most of the storylines and narratives in Sex Education play out like they were written by an AI who scanned through the scripts of every low-budget and uncreative high school teen drama. They're overly familiar, clich\u00e9, and predictable. There's just nothing about the stories here that standouts in anyway, not in the ideas themselves nor the way they are executed. It heavily relies on love triangles and *will-they-wont-theys* for conflict, and this is especially the case for the 2 main characters. By the time we get to the 3rd season, this reliance has detrimental effects on both their developments. Character development is more fortunate to side characters. Adam, Aimee and Mimi are all characters with interesting narratives and development throughout the 3 seasons who've all shown growth in their own ways, but unfortunately at some point or another they too find themselves connected to uninspiring or just bad storytelling.\n\nOn top of all that, Sex Education has such an unnatural way of going about things. I know it's a sex comedy that's purposefully over-the-top, but its silliness sometimes clashes with its sentiments. Sentiments I always agree with wholefully by the way, but rarely ever get any emotional impact from, even though the show insists on knocking viewers over the head with it every single time! Throughout rewatching 3 seasons of Sex Education, I also grew tired of almost every conversation, plot, and every other little thing revolving around sex. I know it's essentially the premise of the series, but it's always so forceful and in-your-face about it, that it makes sex come off as the lamest fucking thing ever. I don't know, it just feels like there's something missing here when it comes to sex, and even though this series has numerous amounts of sex scenes, almost one per episode, it's probably one of the most unsexy shows you could ever watch. \n\n    rating:\n           season 1: 6.3 out of 10\n           season 2: 6.7 out of 10\n           season 3: 6.7 out of 10",

Others had turned their backs to the stage. Now more were chanting, \u201cPay your writers,\u201d as Zaslav, a studio head, was one of the oft-invoked villains of the striking Writers Guild of America.\n\n>He tried to press on with his story, continuing to quote Welch: \u201cSome people will be looking for a fight.\u201d The booing continued.\n\n>Zaslav later issued a statement thanking BU for the invitation, and insisting, \u201cas I have often said, I am immensely supportive of writers and hope the strike is resolved soon and in a way that they feel recognizes their value.\u201d But he had been humiliated, openly and unapologetically, and while he was duly kowtowed after the fact\u2014BU President Robert Brown publicly apologized for the incident, blaming it on \u201ccancel culture\u201d\u2014he must\u2019ve wondered, somewhere in the back of his mind, how it had come to this.\n\n>In a relatively short period of time, David Zaslav has become perhaps the most hated man in Hollywood.

Zaszlav had been CEO of Discovery Communications since 2006, where he oversaw the transition from, in his words, \u201cno longer a cable company, (but) a content company.\u201d What that meant, from a viewer\u2019s perspective, was Discovery\u2019s transition from educational programming to reality slop\u2014which is, of course, a much more lucrative business model.\n\n>In his (slight) defense, there were considerable challenges awaiting the CEO of the new Warner Bros. Discovery conglomerate, whomever that might have been. Warner Bros. had, like most motion picture studios, struggled considerably during the pandemic. Their decision to simultaneously stream their entire 2021 theatrical slate on the HBOMax streaming service upset other filmmakers, including those whose films were impacted by it (and theatrical chains as well). One example? Christopher Nolan, who\u2019s enormously profitable relationship with WB began back in 2002, was so pissed that he took his new film Oppenheimer to Universal out of frustration by the company\u2019s poor handling of his 2020 feature Tenet.\n\n>In retrospect, the right person for the job of healing those wounds and reestablishing relationships with filmmakers might not have been the guy best known for shepherding the likes of Naked and Afraid, Dr. Pimple Popper, and My 600-lb Life. And, to be fair, figures from the world of reality TV are often seen with suspicion, if not outright snobbery, by those responsible for scripted fare. But Zaslav did himself no favors, and did little to blur that binary, when announcing the merger of the HBOMax and Discovery+ streaming services in a quarterly earnings call\u2014which included a much-derided infographic deeming HBOMax\u2019s scripted programming as \u201cmale skew,\u201d \u201cappointment viewing,\u201d and \u201clean in\u201d (?), while Discovery+\u2019s unscripted shows were \u201cfemale skew\u201d \u201ccomfort viewing,\u201d and thus \u201dlean back\u201d (?!?).\n\n>More distressingly, in that same call, Zaslav announced that two nearly completed films that had been greenlit and produced under the previous regime for streaming on HBOMax\u2014the DC superhero story Batgirl and the family sequel Scoob!: Holiday Haunt\u2014would not be distributed on the platform or released in theaters. Instead, they would be essentially wiped from existence and used as a tax-write down.\nEagle-eyed subscribers subsequently noted that several other Max originals, including the Seth Rogen comedy An American Pickle and Robert Zemeckis\u2019s remake of The Witches, had been quietly removed from the service, in a further attempt to save money. The service proceeded to remove several dozen series from its library, from HBO originals like Westworld and Vinyl to family programming like The Not-Too-Late Show with Elmo to animated series like Infinity Train. \n\n>Even episodes of Sesame Street weren\u2019t safe. Several other streaming services, including Paramount+, Starz, Showtime, Disney+ and Hulu, have followed suit, disappearing their underperforming originals for tax purposes, creating giant swaths of shockingly recent yet bafflingly \u201clost\u201d media.\n\n>Meanwhile, the merger of the HBOMax and Discovery+ services continued apace, with a bizarre rebranding to simply \u201cMax,\u201d consciously choosing to remove its most prestigious and identifiable piece of branding. (It was akin to Disney+ renaming itself \u201cPlus.\u201d) It was almost as if the reality-skewing CEO was ashamed of the streamer\u2019s affiliation with high-quality, high-profile scripted programming\u2014a perception further confirmed when Max launched in May.\n\n>On the \u201cdetails\u201d tab for film and shows on the service\u2019s new interface, writers, directors, and producers, no matter how they\u2019re credited in the work in question, are lumped together (in no particular order) under the nebulous designation of \u201ccreators.\u201d (That means, for example, that according to Max, the film Raging Bull was \u201ccreated\u201d by Peter Savage, Martin Scorsese, Mardik Martin, Robert Chartoff, Paul Schrader, Jake La Motta, Irwin Winkler, and Joseph Carter.) A joint statement from the Director\u2019s Guild of America and the Writer\u2019s Guild of America West criticized the \u201cunilateral decision by Warner Bros. Discovery to change the long-standing individual credits of directors and writers in the new rollout of Max.\u201d Max quickly promised to \u201ccorrect the credits, which were altered due to an oversight in the technical transition from HBO Max to Max.\u201d More than a month later, the \u201coversight\u201d has not been corrected.\n\n>That backlash, however, was nothing compared to what happened recently. In mid-June, Warner Bros Discovery cut loose five of the most senior executives (\u201cthe people who\u2019ve been the architect of the brand for decades,\u201d according to one insider) at Turner Classic Movies, the cable network beloved among cinephiles\u2014and high-profile filmmakers. Steven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese, and Paul Thomas Anderson quickly released a statement, noting, \u201cTurner Classic Movies has always been more than just a channel. It is truly a precious resource of cinema, open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. And while it has never been a financial juggernaut, it has always been a profitable endeavor since its inception.\u201d And while they insisted Zaslav had assured them \u201cthat TCM and classic cinema are very important to him,\u201d subsequent reporting indicated that TCM\u2019s staff had been cut from 90 employees to a skeletal 20.\n\n>Nearly lost in the hullabaloo was yet another of the company\u2019s exhaustive attempts to squeeze a profit from its assets: a $500 million deal to sell around half of their film and TV-music library. In a perhaps too-good-to-be-true detail, the sale would reportedly include \u201cAs Time Goes By\u201d from Casablanca\u2014the musical fanfare that plays before every Warner Bros. feature film.\n\n>Barely a month ago, Graydon Carter was hosting a party in Zaslav\u2019s honor at Cannes, all but crowning him as the heir apparent to Jack Warner. But there\u2019s a crucial difference between Zaslav and the old-school moguls he\u2019s attempting to emulate: They loved movies, and cared about filmmakers. Zaslav sees movies as \u201ccontent,\u201d sees filmmakers as \u201ccontent creators,\u201d and is only interested in maintaining, preserving, and presenting \u201ccontent\u201d that can make him and his stockholders a quick buck. Anything that doesn\u2019t, he\u2019ll happily gut. He\u2019s closer to Logan Roy than Jack Warner and there is a genuine, understandable fear that his bean-counting represents not just shrugging indifference but outright hostility to cinema and its rich history.\n\n>In Pretty Woman, Richard Gere stars as Edward Lewis, a corporate raider who buys companies \u201cthat are in financial difficulty\u201d and sells off their pieces. \u201cSo it's sort of like stealing cars and selling them for the parts, right?\u201d asks call girl Vivian (Julia Roberts), when he explains what he does, and it\u2019s hard not to think of Lewis when looking over Zaslav\u2019s reign at Warner Bros Discovery, stepping into the distressed conglomerate and stripping it for parts.\n\n>Edward Lewis, however, is at least honest about what he does. \u201cYou don't make anything,\u201d Vivian notes, and he agrees; \u201cYou don\u2019t build anything,\u201d she continues, and he concurs with that as well. And perhaps that\u2019s why David Zaslav is earning a concerning reputation so far. He\u2019s out here carrying on like a mogul, but based on his performance to date, he\u2019s only good at breaking things.\n\n[A back up link](https://archive.is/2023.07.03-160323/https://www.gq.com/story/david-zaslav-warner-bros-discovery-ceo-tcm-max)\n\nAnd an article [discussing this strange decision by GQ](https://www.allyourscreens.com/en/component/k2/item/3874-gq-editors-rewrite-then-pull-david-zaslav-profile) EDIT: Not strange upon finding out GQ's owner Conde Nast has an 8% stake in Warner Bros/Discovery.",

If you actually look at his plan, you can see that Cartman had Scott wrapped around his finger and no matter what direction Scott, Cartman was getting revenge one way or another and in the end, Cartman's revenge payed off because he killed Scott's parents, FED THEM TO HIM, and showed in front of Kyle and Stan that he's not to be underestimated and simultaneously got Radiohead to embarrass Scott in front of everyone.  This is usually seen as one of the best scenes in South Park history.\n\nSo across TV media, has there ever been a revenge plot this clever? Where the revenger has the revengee wrapped around the finger and it would've been a win-win no matter what choice the revengee went with? Where the revenger showcased to everyone they shouldn't be messed with and it's a scene that sticks in your mind to this day.\n\nWhat is your favorite revenge plot like the Cartman v. Tenorman revenge plot? Where it was clever and satisfying?",

It's a story about a guy who dreamed of escaping his dark past and blamed others when he couldn't escape it when the reality is he is the one who kept himself tied to it. He wanted to live a different life, and he finally got it. But in the end, every single time he had a choice to say \"no, I'm not that person anymore,\" he didn't and fell back into his old ways. Consistently. Repeatedly. Even after 8 years of living the closest thing to the life he wanted to live, he still couldn't actually let it go. He put his family in danger and trudged off to go kill someone for a grudge he couldn't let go. \n\nThe irony of the ending is that despite being such a despicable person, the world - and even his son - remembered him the way he wanted to be remembered - a whitewashed lie resembling the person he wished he was. The only person keeping Barry from being the person he wanted to be was Barry. Not Fuches, not Couseau, not Hank, not anyone. Barry wanted to be someone else, and he could have been (he dabbled in it!) but at the end of the day when he was given a choice to *do the correct thing to become a better person*, he never did.\n\nBarry was a fraud.

The scene was shot over four days in Dubrovnik, Croatia at a cost of $50,000 per day. That adds up to $200,000 just to shoot nudity outside. Despite the expensive price tag for a scene without VFX, Game of Thrones is lucky that the scene moved forward and was shot, at all.",
                "I think what you\u2019re experiencing is the prosthetics are good enough these days, that it\u2019s practical to have them for dicks. \n\nSex education and Pam and tommy was the other big one, use prosthetics rather than actor nudity. \n\nShows like game of thrones is all really and kinda apart of the shows culture for male and female actors. \n\nThat\u2019s a factor if there isn\u2019t much of another explanation. I don\u2019t think the rules or laws around it have changed. Nudity use to be way more common than it is now.",
                "There is a wide push within certain parts of the industry to balance the scales between all the historical female nudity and lack of male nudity.  I'm not making a judgement statement on if that is good or bad, but I'm not sure how you can deny it is happening.\n\nWestworld season 2 was where I first noticed it though",
                "You can show male genitalia, but not an erection. That seems to be where they draw the line. A lot of what you see is also prosthetic.",
                "I would say it\u2019s a mix of a) audiences being more comfortable with male nudity now and b) women having more power on set to say what they are and aren\u2019t comfortable with.  \n\nBecause of things like the Me Too movement, there is a shift now with women speaking up if they\u2019re uncomfortable with certain things on set, as well as intimacy coordinators becoming a common thing. Like it or not, women are likely to face more publicity, backlash and disturbing fan interactions if they go fully nude on screen, especially on popular shows. I would surmise more are opting out of going nude to protect themselves from unwanted attention. Emilia Clarke in GOT refused to go nude in later seasons, Ana de Armas recently came out saying she worried what response she\u2019d get from her nude scenes in Blonde. Sydney Sweeney has talked about feeling less respected for her acting because of what she shows of her body on screen, and asking Euphoria\u2019s creator for less nudity unless it was necessary to the story. While in the past they may have been more hesitant to speak up, there are systems in place nowadays to ensure actresses are comfortable in the spaces they perform in. And if there\u2019s no need to do it, then why would they?\n\nAlso, a lot of male nudity on screen uses prosthetics these days so that\u2019s one thing. But I also think men are more likely to go full-frontal because their nudity isn\u2019t as \u201csexualized\u201d as the women, and they can get away with it (mostly) without much media attention. It\u2019s a brave thing to do, and I think it\u2019s great if it\u2019s serves the story but we should never expect anyone to go nude if they\u2019re uncomfortable with it.",

It might very well break suspension of disbelief.\n   \nInstead we've got two memorable moments linked together by their sheer polarity, good direction and REALLY good music.

Adam it was really just more since last season he had a bit too, but he felt much more prominent here. I think they handled this season so amazingly with how they took the focus off of Maeve and Otis and put more of the driving story elements in the other cast members. They could have easily just done another season of the main story being their relationship and how it gets messed up again. But instead they sort of turned it into the background thing, where we get most of its progression through how it effects their relationship with the people they were with now in Isaac and Ruby.\n\nI think they did a great job not focusing on them and making a majority of the other cast very interesting to see. It wasn't perfect, there were some that either didn't get enough screentime to flesh them out or they weren't entertaining enough to keep my attention compared to others. But overall it was such a good season with so many great examples when it comes to tackling important issues in not only teens but society as a whole.",

The chemistry between the two was so unexpected but incredible. They really grew off each other only for the writers to push the clich\u00e9 narrative and dump her. I've waited 3 seasons for Otis and Maeve to get together and when they finally do I felt nothing, the spark is gone between them and I just feel like its forced at this point.",

                "(some spoilers in here) \n\nI agree that season 3 was absolutely amazing, the writing was so good! They wove such beautiful character arcs together, and I came to really care for all of them. I also loved how much it emphasized the reality that sometimes the most loving thing to do is to break up. \n\nI do wish there would be some representation of polyamory though. I think Eric is clearly polyamorous, and it would have been nice to hear him say to Adam that just because he enjoyed his experience with someone else, doesn't mean he loves Adam any less. \"many parts complete the whole of me\"\n\nSpeaking of Adam,  I think the actor who played him did such a great job of softly integrating the emotional depth the writers ultimately gave him. Over the course of the series, his expressions went from being dumb and vacant to genuine warmth and feeling in a way that didn't make his character development seem like a sudden switch.\n\nOMG and LILLY!! I was so so so so glad that they included aliens and kept those sweet queer kids together. That part really warmed my heart. \n\nAlso completely agree that Ruby's character was so sweet and I came to love her and I do think her and Otis would be better together. But she should also learn how to not be such a jerk to him. Why would he \"love\" her when she has mostly put him down their entire relationship, instead of expressing her attraction and support. \n\nI love that Maeve ended up getting out of that town and away from her toxic family. And Maeve's acceptance of Aimee's encouragement was a real high point for me. Feminism baby!\n\nIt was also a journey for me watching this season because Aimee's story was triggering. But I so appreciated the writer's treatment of PTSD. It was very affirming for me to watch Aimee go through the same issues I've been going through. There was even a moment during her therapy session with Jean that I felt like Jean was my therapist, and she was telling me just what I needed to hear. The show was very sensitive about this topic and I hope it will raise awareness to others about how challenging PTSD and sexual assault are. \n\nJust such a fantastic show, all around. I hope there is a season 4, but I also kinda don't cause the last episode was just so perfect. (but they sure did put in a hell of a twist right at the end!)",

Literally paint the sets grey and put all the students in uniform. Apart from their after-school outfits (which started to get seriously repetitive) and Jean's maternity wear, there was no longer any interesting fashion and the fun colors of the school were eliminated.\n\nWe binged season 2 before watching season 3 since we couldn't remember anything from the recap, and it was fun and easy to binge. But season 3 felt like such a slog. Plots and setups got recycled over and over, it felt like everyone was making the worst and most selfish choices until I couldn't be bothered to root for anyone because they all just sucked as people (except poor long-suffering Adam). Plot points were abruptly terminated, opportunities were completely shoved aside. Interesting character development was dismissed when the writers got bored or wanted to add more penis and vagina costumes.\n\nAnd while the previous seasons felt pretty grounded in realism, this season was completely illogical. The whole open-day performance had me rolling my eyes and cringing hard. The writers seemed to be initially making Hope more of a sympathetic figure, or at least one whose motivations appeared to make some sense, but then decided she'd be better off as a moustache-twirling villain who uses the same discipline techniques on her students as abusive \"troubled teen\" camps, with no pushback from teachers.\n\nAnd *how old* is Isaac? We're supposed to find it just tickety-boo that a grown ass man pursued a teenager with sexual intent and was constantly watching her and her family out his window? His character was disgusting and creepy and yet he was rewarded for his actions. That was repulsive.",
                "I kind of hated it, was bored out of my skull for a lot of it.\n\nIt felt like the writers had no idea what to do with any of the characters so everyone is just left meandering about. What reason is there to show the ex-principal floundering? Why show the new principal having trouble conceiving? Why have Jean go into emergency surgery when everyone watching know's she'll be okay? Why give Lily's alien fetish a backstory?\n\nTo fill time cause they didn't know what to do.\n\nAnd the Maeve/Otis will they won't they is so played out by now that you just don't really care. Especially since they delved more into Ruby who clearly cared more about Otis than Maeve ever has.\n\nAnd the ending was obvious from the second episode shen we learned about the America trip for the first time.",

                "Although most of you think I was inspired by the character \"Otis\", which is not true btw, I really like to talk to people and help them out. It actually arrives as a rush to connect with people and share warmth or bitterness they may have been holding on for a really long time. \nSo If any person needs a friend or a person to talk to about their feelings, I'm always ready to connect.

And while the events \u201ccovered\u201d here are very broad and well-known, I think the subject matter played a role in my enjoyment.\n\nThe jokes are really funny, often brilliant in their simplicity. There were a ton of writers on each episode, but it was the same writers for each one, which might be the reason for the consistency across the series.\n\nAnd Diane Morgan is just hilarious as this character. Despite saying patently ridiculous things, she imitates the cadence of actual BBC reporters remarkably well. If someone wasn\u2019t paying attention, I almost think you could trick them into thinking this was a real documentary, at least for a bit. And much like the work of Sacha Baron Cohen, I was amazed how she was able to avoid simultaneously laughing and cringing during the interviews with the experts like I was.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not actually completely devoid of educational value.

A lot of them are already making the transition into young-adult autonomy and getting up to no good. Not to mention there's all the old books and notes left over. Even so, there are only a few places that are really thriving beyond the level of subsistence and barter. \n\n> vaccine research\n\nYeah... no spoilers, but that will make a lot more sense later on. One thing you should note though is that in the scene where Jeremiah is talking to the vaccine researchers? One of their computers, out of his sight, has \"VS\" emblazoned on the side.

It's not like this show hasn't shown other controversial things in prior seasons (like institutionalizing cousins in homes and throwing out the key). Yes it's fictionalized with some speculation, even with some grains of truth thrown in. I don't see how Season 5 should be any different.",

As if that weren't bad enough, the fact that due to the set design and props it appears at first to be set in the 1980s (even with old cars from the 80s and early 90s, which are exceedingly rare in the UK), but then you see them put on a DVD on a flat screen TV and realise that it's actually present day.\n\nThese factors combined were just so irritating and distracting that I couldn't continue any more.

Which often makes these sort of things hard to be invested about. Is it worth continuing?",

Even in Skins\u2019 more somber stories, the kids found a way to be hopeful for the future as they left university.\n\nEuphoria doesn\u2019t have this and I don\u2019t think it makes the show more grounded or realistic. \n\nAs for the nudity, none of it really bothers me. It doesn\u2019t even feel sexualized, per se. Even Cassie\u2019s nude scenes feel sad, because her whole perspective on intimacy is messed up.",

It just makes me question the people behind it and why they feel the need to do it over and over\u2026 like are you guys okay? YALL are choosing to film scenes like this, over and over, about teenagers\u2026?\n\nObviously I don\u2019t think HBO really cares about this because sex is what has always gotten them their viewership.\n\nBut this doesn\u2019t change the fact that most people like watching movies with friends/family, and we all dread sex scenes, as we\u2019d rather not consume porn-esque content on the couch with our mother\u2026\n\nBut r*** scenes are a whole other beast, because now we\u2019re seeing an act that\u2019s supposed to be fun and consensual, turned into a traumatic spectacle\u2026 for our entertainment..?\n\nLike sorry, no I\u2019m not entertained and I definitely won\u2019t be able to get off for a while because of this, so thanks for that. \n\nThen there\u2019s the way the men characters in the show talk about women, like it\u2019s reality on steroids to the highest degree. Hearing men demean women and equate them to objects, that are either whores or prudes or nothing more. Then how this mentality gets forced on the few good guy characters \ud83d\ude2d it\u2019s realistic to a major extent, I know because I\u2019ve seen it. But it\u2019s horrifying and not entertaining at all.\n\nWe all have different limits and stuff, so no judgement. Maybe it doesn\u2019t bother most people, but that\u2019s mostly what puts me off. \n\nI can only watch 1-2 episodes of Euphoria in one sitting, and then it can take me weeks to return to it.

Euphoria is easily the one of the best just because of the cinematography, camera work, lighting, music, color pallate, acting, framing and visual appeal alone. Even if the premise and plot are below average the production value and visual appeal is good enough for it to cement its place as one of the best teen dramas. \n\nWe Are Who We Are(SKY ATLANTIC) is the only teen drama which is better than Euphoria. Normal People(HULU) is also on the same level imo.",

                "I see tons of people complaining about the whole Otis Ola situation at the end of season 1 (which is totally understandable, i was pissed too).. BUT, you don't want to see Otis with Maeve yet, here's why:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\[Spoilers\\]\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Otis has obvious problems sexually. Witnessing his father cheat and the chaos that ensued thereafter has seriously messed him up psychologically and it is putting tons of pressure on his sex life, or lack thereof (Especially with himself). If Maeve caught up to Otis before he kissed Ola and that relationship started there would be a huge discrepancy in sexual experience between the two, making the relationship impossible. Every time she looks at him he gets flustered not only because he really likes her but because he doesn't have the experience with females yet.\n\n\\- Otis with Ola gives him a kind sweethearted girl who he can 'experiment' with, gain some much needed experience and eventually pursue Maeve again. We already witnessed in the winding seconds of season 1 that Otis is starting to come out of his shell a bit after successfully 'experimenting' with himself. That's a huge step for him. There is also clear reason to believe Ola is Bisexual. I theorize Ola will fall for a female during her relationship with Otis, or shortly thereafter.\n\n\\- Season 1 couldn't end with Otis and Maeve getting together because they still need to run their sex clinic operation at school. If they were in some sort of relationship you would completely lose all of the great sexual tension between the two and the clinic operation wouldn't really feel same. Also, we get a sense that their friendship is blossoming and they are getting closer in that aspect, which in-turn equates to more sexual tension. I'm also going to predict at the end of season 2 they STILL won't be together, but at the same time I don't think Otis will lose his virginity to Ola. I think they will attempt to (Like he did with Lily) although this time instead of not being able to follow through out of fear i think he won't be able to follow through because it's with the wrong girl. MAEVE WILL BE HIS FIRST. Put it to the bank.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll in all I like where season 1 ended. Instead of Otis swooning over Maeve I think were gonna see moments of Maeve swooning for Otis mroe in season 2. Especially after she witnessed him with Ola. Jealousy will set in and something drastic will happen. I.e She will make a move, kiss him, etc. Season 2 will be a good one. Can't wait!",
                "Just finished binge watching it, I think a bit of suspension of disbelief is needed because I presume the mashup of British and American culture was entirely intentional, and really, being a really awkward teenager that doesn't really know a lot about sex is kinda universal no matter what culture you were brought up in.. \nReally enjoyed it, I liked that every character was flawed and some of them frustrated me but I still liked them, except the headmaster, he's a dickhead. ***Spoiliiiesss***Saw the Eric and Adam thing coming from the beginning****, i really hope there's a season 2 and that somehow I'll see even a smidgen of a redeeming quality about Adam's dad and they start to understand eachother at some point because their dynamic is just heartbreaking to watch. I understand why Maeve is so cagey but it's really frustrating how she always managed to manipulate Otis into doing things \n",

Adam's storyline felt wierd to me.  Pretty much halfway in I guess that he probably is gay because there was nothing happening with him except his interactions with Eric. Otis ending up with the other girl was a good choice because I felt like it would be so cliche if he ends up with Maeve. It sets up a good season 2 also because it continues the whole clinic thing and also him getting Maeve in better circumstances. \n\nOverall the show was enjoyable to watch and I'll definetly be hoping for a second season.

Then I saw a 70s Austin Allegro (or some other UK shitbox car) on the show and then it hit me, it's not trying to do a realistic depiction of any time period because those cars were absolutely shit back then and people got rid of them in less then 5 years because they were rusty shitboxes and there's absolutely noone who would keep one up untill the 80s. Jokes aside, I think it's the show trying to tell us that it's not only the current generation going through the teenage sex-ed phase but it's something of all times. I like the show, has something really quirky about it. Also, great soundtrack.",

As a 17 year old male I can obviously relate to a lot of what goes on in this show, but I could see it easily appealing to a much broader audience. Great soundtrack, loved the creative cinematography, and it kept me genuinely interested the whole time. I found myself surprisingly attached to all the characters and cringing right along with Otis.\n\nTo complain a bit, the writing is just okay. Interactions between characters, especially between Otis and his mother are odd at times. Conversations don't feel natural. I'd forgive this in a more traditional high-school drama **cough** ^riverdale **cough**, but to me a show that deals with such personal and real themes should have dialogue to match. Foreshadowing was too obvious at times, though not egregious. The worst thing I can say about this show is that it has its fair share of clich\u00e9s.\n\nThese are just nitpicks, though, and they could easily be improved in a second season. Overall I had a great time with this show and I would absolutely recommend it. It starts off slow but keep watching, I promise you'll get into it.",
                "Personally, I'm undecided whether the Americanisation of the british school experience was a positive or negative. I went a British sixth form and this show is absolutely nothing resembling the school experience I or any of my friends have. However, the american-esque setting did allow the plot to ease along the traditional coming of age notes, from the school dance to locker room conversations. School dances in Britain do not hold the same prestige as the one in the show, for example. But ultimately I liked that episode quite a lot. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n I read an interview where the producer said they didn't want the negativity, grey skies and, quoting, 'bad teeth' of British school telelvision series. Honestly, if I hadn't read this snippet while deciding whether the show was for me, it probably wouldn't have urked me so much. But then I started wondering why the hell they didn't just set it in America. They could export the British writing talent no problem, but they decided on Wales with almost no one having the accent. Hell, even the weather is sunny 24/7, as if to make a statement. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOverall, I thought it was very good. Characters were solid and mostly consistent. Occassionally it leaned a little heavier into the drama than what I was expecting, but I roled with it by the end. As a lot of people are pointing out, the only thing that irked me was the setting. I really wish it didn't, but it kept chipping away at me every episode. ",

Otis is an intelligent nice guy who gets in troubles in high school, but eventually gets some jackpot. His friend is a cliched black LGBT guy     and comic relief. Maeve is a smart \"bad girl\" (like Emma Stone's character in *Easy A*) who is also kinda \"a whore with golden heart.\" There are a jock (the Russians would also say, \"a [gopnik] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopnik)\") who abuses his schoolmates, rich privileged bitches with some \"wannabe,\" liberal parents (a mother in our case), you name it.

It's the problem with Netflix currently is they've gone from giving everyone free reign to try and recreate the Stranger Things formula.\n\nNow the show seems well shot and well made and has an interesting premise and might even be good but it's a shame that it abandoned its Britishness for non artistic reasons.\n\nBut watching the viagra scene in episode one it's got some good dialogue and acting.

            "selftext": "Sex Education was a pleasant surprise for me. Teen-based shows aren't always the best and the title of the show made it seem that it would be a cheesy show about teens and sex. Sex Ed is exactly about that but it takes a much more mature perspective. But where it shines is in its setting and how it creates an extremely likable cast of characters.\n\nSE has a fairly unique setting mixing American school culture as depicted in pop culture with the British. The characters use smartphones but the cars, furniture and even clothing feel like they belong in the 80s/90s. It can be confusing at first but I guess it lends a timeless and unique feeling to the show. You can easily distinguish it from other school based shows.\n\nSex Ed also features a variety of fully developed characters. Many of us can relate to Otis and his awkwardness. Maeve is arguably the best character on the show. 2 seasons on, it is still difficult to fully understand her. It is not shy to take the spotlight off the main characters and give the supporting characters room for development. By the end of season 2, you are invested in about 8-10 characters, all bringing unique issues to the table. \n\nAs explicit as the title is, SE is warm, heartfelt and very funny. It often subverts typical cliches and does so smartly. Aimee's bus trip in season 2 is one great example. What do you think about Sex Education?",

            "selftext": "I think this is a very underrated and fun TV series. I remember in 2008 when prepping up for 'Kingdom of the Crystal Skulls' they released the DVD sets and aired showings on History International (miss that channel). I, as now, had a big interest WWI and the air war so in a time where WWI content was scarce, I was excited. Overall I thought it was a fun and educational series. Sure it seemed corny that he keeps bumping into about every important figure where he went but part of its charm was all the locations and historical events that Indy goes through. \n\nWhat I liked of the series is that they seemed to have done quite a good bit of research when writing episodes. For example, \"The Phantom Train of Doom\" where Indy and Remy gets lost in Africa and they bump into an armed band of older men that range from cowboys to a circus clown. I thought that was made up for the episode but as it turns out it was a real battalion. They were the *25th (Frontiersmen) Battalion, Royal Fusiliers* and indeed there were quite a mix of characters in that group, including a clown. Also in \"Attack of the Hawkmen\", the Germans develop a giant triplane bomber set to fly long range to drop propaganda on New York. This was also based on history and was called the [Mannesmann Giant Triplane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mannesmann_Giant_Triplane) which was allegedly intended for New York to drop propaganda leaflets. I also thought it was great that they did episodes on the African and Middle East front which doesn't get much attention than the Western Front. \n\nOverall I thought Sean Patrick Flanery did a great job as young Indy. There are also some actors in the show that stared before they were more well known such as Daniel Craig and Catherine Zeta Jones. The locations, production, and stories were great, especially for a TV series. Sadly the series was canceled due to costs and ratings. It was good for what is there and I highly recommend giving it a go!\n\nEdit: Spelling and punctuation",

                "It was a great series and one of my favorites. The first two seasons aired on ABC and didn't get the ratings they were hoping for. It was not a cheap show and filmed all over the world. I think viewers expected movie-like adventures (Harrison Ford did play Indy for one episode) instead of a coming-of-age story.  Family Channel took it over and aired the final four films. Lucas envisioned it as an educational project which could be shown in schools to get kids interested in historical figures. \n\nWhen they brought it out on DVD, they included a lot of supplemental material and reworked and paired the episodes into 22 two-hour movies. They added some new clips to make some episodes work together. The youngest version of Indy, Corey Carrier, had grown quite a bit by this point, so they digitally shrank him to make him look younger in the new footage. They dumped the series' George Hall as elderly Indy bookends and that was okay with me. \n\nIn the fourth Indiana Jones feature film, Indy mentioned that he rode with Pancho Villa, a direct reference to the two-hour premiere of Young Indy. Most didn't get the reference but it made me smile that the show hasn't completely been forgotten.",

At first I thought it would only be funny because of the shock factor but I was laughing out loud in every episode. It also tackles some serious themes very well. \n\nThe characters are very real and no one is flawless. The mistakes they make and them being assholes might anger the viewer but once you remind yourself they're teenagers and the situations they're in they almost feel like perfect mistakes. Isaac comes in mind. \n\nThe show is very open on sex and lgbt, as one would expect but in good way. I only had a small problem with the two nonbinary characters in S3, it feels like they got added just so the show has some nonbinary characters too.\n\nEric needs to face repercussions for his actions in S2 and S3. \n\nI'm pretty okay with Groff and Hope being borderline comic villains in a teen drama. \n\nGood foreshadowing for future events. \n\nOtis and Ola were so weird together. \n\nAimee didn't feel affected at all, only after Maeve helped her. \n\nI was hating Viv until she stood up to Hope. \n\nOtis and Ruby was amazing and I feel so sorry for her but... \n\nMaeve is easily the best character in the show by far. I WILL DO ANYTHING FOR YOU MY QUEEN. \n\nOtis and Maeve are the pairing a show like this not only needs but relies on. The two people that are made for each other. The love that will ruin great relationships because you can't get over the other. Ruby may have deserved it but it would never have been right if Otis didn't end up with Maeve.\n\nS1 > S3 > S2 but all three are excellent. \n\nNow for S4. \n\nMaeve may not like it or struggle in America and return very soon. \n\nI really hope Otis or Maeve don't slip while waiting for one another. \n\nI read comments saying that Groff's brother might buy the school and employ him as headmaster. It's a very logical prediction both in the show and irl with budgets. If the students went to other schools they most likely wouldn't all go to the same. So it would be pointless to show e.g. The Untouchables if they went to a different school than Otis. \n\nThe show I think will spend half the time in the last term in school and the other half in summer. \n\nI would like to see Otis and Maeve enjoy themselves in a relationship. \n\nI would be 'eh ok I guess' if the show spent the whole season showing their struggles and reuniting them right at the last minutes of the last episode. \n\nI am burning Netflix headquarters if Otis and Maeve get in a relationship only to break up because they go to different universities.",

We didn't have uniforms in our 6th form. \n\nThe show mentions a 'year 9', which implies it's not exclusively a 6th form college. So the school students should be in uniform, but I'd say we never see an extra that could pass for being 14. So I guess that's a creative decision they made, cos a lot of the clothes are brightly coloured and influenced by fashion from across the decades, so it's clearly a design choice. \n\nBut in our school we had the American style lockers. We had a prom. We consumed a lot of American media (Dawson's Creek, Buffy, The OC) etc. I imagine it's only increased in the past decade. So US pop culture heavily influenced us all.\n\nIf you want to see a more typical UK depiction of school, then I'd say The InBetweeners is the one. There's Skins too, but that's certainly not realistic (Sex Education maybe stylised and heightened, but it feels more real to me). Fresh Meat is a good choice for the UK Uni setting.",

What\u2019s confusing is that even with widely known content, like Hamlet or Of Mice and Men (to name a couple of productions I\u2019d love to own), they don\u2019t release them to own, even though filmed versions exist (Andrew Scott\u2019s Hamlet on BBC, James Franco in Of Mice and Men was a one night only cinema screening.) \n\nI\u2019ll check it out when it releases, but I\u2019m expecting most of the content to be decades old.

It is disingenuous. In fact, it's not even sped anymore. It's kids with severe autism mostly. So go work with extremely difficult children and everything will be peachy. To me special education seems like a calling within a calling. I think for subject teachers like me you get drawn to the subject then drawn to teaching not to special ed teaching. I just really loathe being a para right now and it is ruining my desire for teaching. I don't like having any control over the pacing and what is taught in the classroom, nor do I like making minimum wage for performing an extremely emotionally draining job. Tech salaries make me pissed off even more. I'm thinking this might be remedied by becoming a teacher, it will be my own classroom, I'll make more money, etc. I don't know though. I think they should do away with alternative teacher certification altogether and require all teachers to get a degree in education. Love for your subject should be the last reason for anyone to get into education. I have a history degree and am now stuck either teaching or working at Walmart.",

                "Before I entered college, one of the high schools near me had a history position open. They had 575 applicants for it. I went into special education instead and got $17,500 of my student loans waived for doing so in a Title I school. \n\nI love history too - I love it so much that I created \u201cSouth Cook Explore\u201d to share history online during my lunch breaks. Now I\u2019m about to be a published author, have been on the front page of a Chicago newspaper and began creating free historic events. \n\nI really thought special education wouldn\u2019t be my thing, but my K-22 certification means I can use sign language with kindergarteners, work on reading and writing with specific learning disability middle schoolers, mathematics with intense emotional and behavioral disorder high schoolers (that\u2019s what I do now!) or work with 18+ lower functioning life-skills and transitional students with Down syndrome and autism. It could also mean I co-teach calculus and chemistry for an honors class\u2026it\u2019s disappointing that special edu positions aren\u2019t really listed in detail and I could always be moved around, but special edu is a big field with needed roles all over. \n\nI know I could not work with non-verbal low incident special education kids - you\u2019re right about the calling part, and I wouldn\u2019t try to convince anyone to do emotional disorder work, but opportunities to do what you like are a lot more available with an LBS-1.\n\nThe year after I graduated, my college began requiring any elementary education majors to double major in sped. That\u2019s the way education is going, and I qualify for an extra $3,000+ annually a special edu stipend because of it",

I don\u2019t know if she wants to get out of sped, But she\u2019s been there for several years now and keeps having to physically restrain students who are twice her size maybe even three times. She\u2019s very small. As a result Nobody ever stops these kids from hitting someone, or breaking school supplies, even if the supplies are in a separate Gen Ed  teacher\u2019s room.",
                "At least in my state, doing away with alternative certification pathways would mean 50 student classes for everyone. Between the number of teachers in job-embedded certification programs and those serving on emergency credentials with no license at all, we're just not in a position to change anything right now, even if a lot of those teachers are not well-prepared for the job.",
                "I tell new teachers NOT to get their sped cert! You will never get out! Even if they try to give you a gen Ed position, they will fill your room with sped and/or all the students who haven\u2019t been assessed officially. Also, when the district doesn\u2019t have enough sped teachers they\u2019ll move you back! Don\u2019t do it!!",
                "A couple of schools in my district were over-staffed at a grade level. They moved two teachers. One went from young primary to an older grade, the other was moved into EBD because she had a SpEd endorsement. She refused to go to her new assignment. I am not sure how that played out but that right there, was an aha moment for me. Nope. NEVER.",
                "I think it\u2019s great you\u2019re getting some sped experience before getting a gen ed degree. I don\u2019t think you meant it but you made it sound like sped kids are difficult by default, which is a generalization that isn\u2019t fair. \n\nSo all those tricks and tools will come in handy in the gen ed population. \n\nI agree that being drawn to the content is important but I\u2019d argue that a teacher with really good teaching skills trumps a teacher with better content knowledge. Your first few years of teaching will revolve mostly around management and pedagogy skills, before you can really let your love of the content shine through. \n\nWhat do you love about history?",
                "As someone who feels particularly called to sped I would definetaly not recommend sped to those not interested. It's not good for the teachers or for the children if they don't actually want to do that job.",
                "I have a Masters in Teaching and am working on my second accredited specialist title.\n\nI haven't taken a spec ed class since university. I don't want to get stuck with admin dumping a bunch of IEP kids on me because I'm \"more qualified\" than a colleague.",

                "A degree in History is not very useful if you're not trying to teach. Have you applied to museums to be a tour guide or other type of employee? I think you'd have better luck there.\n\nI definitely agree on not pursuing sped. I feel for sped staff. Their content can change at any moment, the kids can be really difficult and draining, and there is a heavy workload with IEPs. It's not fun and doesn't have much reward.",
                "I was told the same thing. Luckily, I started off as a special education teacher at a therapeutic boarding school, giving me two years of special education experience without ever having been certified or licensed. It allows me to say in interviews, along with having para experience, that I have special education experience -- and I'm not licensed. That looks appealing to employers and is not a lie: they get someone with the experience of working with these types of kids, but not someone they can just force into working in a special education classroom (at least not legally or ethically). \n\nI refuse to get licensed in special ed for that reason. I've seen the public school special ed classes for what they are and they're honestly insane, especially at my school. Even the inclusion classes at some places I've worked at, with one or two challenging students, become hell.",
                "All alternative programs aren\u2019t bad, just like all traditional teacher prep programs aren\u2019t good. It just heavily depends on the program and how they structure it. My college offers an alternative pathway where you come out with a masters degree, and the way it works is, you are a teachers assistant and work in your certifying area as a para for 1 school year. You get TA pay and benefits, and that\u2019s your student teaching year the entire year with whoever you\u2019re assisting who is your mentor teacher. The following school year you are the teacher of record with full teacher pay and benefits, and you have to work in the hiring district for 2 more years. \n\nIn the alternate program im currently enrolled in, you have to have coursework in education to be able to do\nIt. My bachelors is in educational studies, so I\u2019m only eligible to be certified in early childhood or elementary Ed. For example, my program wouldn\u2019t let me do art education, or secondary history through this alternative pathway because I don\u2019t have enough coursework in those areas. My classes in educational studies are the same classes early childhood/elementary majors have to take, it\u2019s just the non certifying track. I have already passed all praxis exams needed for licensure. I will not have student teaching, I\u2019ll be directly in the classroom next school year as a 2nd grade teacher with full teacher pay and benefits and I have to do it for 3 years before I get my professional license. But for this program you have to have education experience, and I\u2019ve been a para in gen Ed and sped (moderate-severe profound self contained is my FAVORITE out of all the sped categories) for the last 5 years, and a sub for 3 years prior to that.\n\nYou *might have to make a compromise somewhere, or maybe you\u2019ll get a job right off the bat. History teaching positions are notoriously difficult to acquire because they\u2019re so competitive. I would definitely not get certified in sped if you really don\u2019t want to do it, but keep in mind some districts strongly prefer dual certification. The district I grew up in gives preferences to those teachers due to the amount of students that are on IEPs, including in the general education setting, so chances are you will at some point have kids on an IEP in your class and you\u2019ll need to know how to work with them.",
                "Sped is job security",
                "I\u2019m a para right now and I know that there\u2019s a time limit for it being sustainable. I don\u2019t understand how anybody stays in the field long term but if you aren\u2019t one of those people you should get out as soon as you can. Burnout can last for years",
                "I thought my SPED degree would have value as another certification area. I now wish I had done my Master's in science education instead.i could have taken courses to earn more science certifications outside of my current area (biology).\n\nAll that being said, my program still had value. I felt like I had a much bigger tool belt that has helped me work well with struggling kids, and had been beneficial in my co-teaching relationships.",
                "Schools in my area do this so they can either put you in a SPED classroom, and then you can\u2019t leave, or depending on the way students\u2019 504s and IEPs are written, you can single handedly do their minutes, interventions, whatever during your history class time for no extra pay.",
                "I have SpEd and ESOL cert but teach STEM courses.      Just having the certs doesn't mean someone has the training or temperament, though.    They would have be pretty desperate or dramatically increase salary to make me switch.  Last year they offered a $6k bonus to switch, but I thought it was a joke.  They also made it clear they would not switch out hard to replace teachers like me.  Probably on 10 people in Maryland teach my courses.",
                "Lmao, I actively tell people not to get certified in sped unless the actually want to teach sped. \n\nMy current sped coteacher followed the recommendation of teach sped now, so you can get hired, then they\u2019ll move you to history and 17 years later, he\u2019s teaching sped math.",
                "Agree. I am one of those teachers who got certified in special education to get hired. And now I'm struggling to get it. The lack of support and resources makes the job impossible. I'm burnt out at only year 2. My students deserve better. They deserve someone knowledgeable. And they deserve someone who actually wants to be there",
                "One of the colleges near us had every student get both general and special education certified. There was no choice. One teacher who was in a leave replacement the same time I was student teaching was lamenting the same comments here-that they would never get a general ed job. As the mom of a special needs child, I would want someone who wants to work with my child, not take it as a last resort. It was very obvious to tell over the years who was in the position because they wanted to be and who was there because that was the only way they could get a job. Luckily my child had more of the former and we were grateful for everything they did.",
                "Sped is not for everyone just like teaching any specific age/grade level isn't for everyone. Paras are underpaid and under appreciated - more so than teachers IMO. \n\nGet certified in what you want to teach but take the market where you want to teach into account. I was warned off history because there is a glut of history teachers here (NJ). I teach science in middle school. I am getting my TOSD/SPED cert because that is where I feel my calling (my school is mostly SPED). It DEFINITELY is not for everyone but it feela me with joy and purpose. I wish that for you in whatever you choose. \n\n Set your course for what makes you happy.  Good luck!",
                "My district gives stipends for having ESL and SPED certification, so over time it ends up paying for itself. The risk is you will apply for a job, and admin may move you from one job to another in an emergency opening. I have held a SPED certificate along with my area, but I have never been reassigned.",
                "If you\u2019re not interested in getting a SPED secondary certification, what secondary certification would interest you? History alone isn\u2019t enough.\n\nAlso would you be able to get a history, government, etc masters? Dual enrollment is really big in my district and trending nationally.",
                "I only ever wanted to teach SPED and I recommend against anyone doing it. It\u2019s what I like and I hate it",
                "In my area, preschool/pre-K teachers are required to have a SPED cert. in fact, the ECE program at the local college has the requirements built into the program.",
                "I substitute in a school district that has a lot of student teachers.  Every one of them, without exception, and no matter what grade level/subject is seeking licensure in their chosen area and special education.",
                "I didn\u2019t choose the sped life, the sped life chose me",
                "Better is get an economics/psych cert in addition to history to snag a spot on an SS team",
                "The issue here is really that it\u2019s a bad idea to get certified in something that one is not actually willing to teach. It\u2019s fine to not want to teach special education, whether that be classrooms for students with autism or emotional impairment programs or be the service provider of record for students with SLDs. It\u2019s really okay, as long as general educators are willing to implement accommodations and work with special educators to provide access to the general curriculum, it\u2019s okay to want to teach your content area, the thing you know best.\n\nSeasoned teachers and school districts, it\u2019s not okay to try to coerce new teachers into becoming special educators if that\u2019s not a path they want to follow. If you have 500 applicants for a general education ELA job, then congratulations, hire the best person. Don\u2019t try to talk candidates into \u201cstarting\u201d in special education with the promise of moving into general education. Even if that\u2019s somehow a realistic path in your district, don\u2019t do it.\n\nNew teachers or teacher candidates, it\u2019s not okay to \u201cget your foot in the door\u201d with an additional license in special education if you don\u2019t actually want to work with students with disabilities. Students with disabilities deserve teachers who want to work with them and have the knowledge to do so effectively.",
                "Special Ed is the very last certification that anyone should ever think about.    If my worst enemy told me they were getting a sped cert I\u2019d slap the taste out of their mouth and say \u201cI wish that all the bad things in life happen to you and only you, but a person has to have some type of morals!\u201d",
                "I still don\u2019t get why sped teachers aren\u2019t paid 100k minimum",
                "I've seen many coworkers (past and present) be pressured to go back to sped after getting out or being told they're going to sped after getting out. I had been told that even having a minor in a special education area could have gotten me put temporarily in sped and so I dropped that quick. I make my art room as accessible as I possibly can and I work well with students of varying accommodations but I want to teach art.",
                "The best advice I received was teach 5 years before considering a supplemental sp. ed certification unless that is 100 percent your calling.\n\nI didn\u2019t. I ended up taking a detour into research and higher ed teaching and coming back to k-12\n\nI\u2019m a curriculum supervisor and yes: a sped certification will 100 percent pretty much guarantee your hire: but that\u2019s also where you will need to be placed",
                "By all means get certified to teach in history, but consider adding English or another subject onto it.  Usually it means you just have to take an extra test or one more course and it highly increases your chances of remaining employed. For example, four people on my team are credentialed to teach history, only one actually does lol",
                "Getting hired in History, English, or Elementary are the most difficult areas (not major shortage areas). Yes, you are more likely to get hired in Sped. However, you are also very likely to get hired if you teach math or science. I teach middle school math and science and I have never had difficulty getting hired, and in fact I have had to decide which job offer to take. I have also been able to change schools or districts when I have needed to, no problem.",

                "Before teaching k-12 I was a preschool teacher who got her infant toddler cert just to be more desirable if a hire (I got all the extra cents I could to increase my pay potential and hire ability). Then I got stuck in infant toddler doing what was essentially daycare and not teaching pre-k which was not what I enjoyed.\n\nWhen I went back to school for my k-12 certification I almost did a did dual gen Ed and sped cert but I didn\u2019t finish my sped certification because I didn\u2019t do a second student teaching placement in sped. Best decision I ever made. I do not get \u201cstuck\u201d in sped but I am more skilled with my sped push in students from the classes I took and thus I have the ability to do my job with my inclusion students and have a skill set to help me but since I\u2019m not certified in sped I get to stay in gen Ed.",

                "Maybe standard educators should be educated on neurodiversity, especially when it comes to preventing the abuse of autistic students by their normal peers, and even some teachers. \\[Really, as a moral thus ethical rule, a healthy and safe future should be *every* child\u2019s fundamental right, especially considering the very troubled world into which they never asked to enter.\\]\n\nThere could also be an inclusion in standard high school curriculum of child-development science that would also teach students (without being overly complicated) about the often-debilitating condition.\n\nIf nothing else, the curriculum would offer students an idea/clue as to whether they themselves are emotionally/mentally compatible with the immense responsibility and strains of regular, non-ASD-child parenthood.\n\nIt would explain to students how, among other aspects of the condition, people with ASD (including those with higher functioning autism) are often deemed willfully \u2018difficult\u2019 and socially incongruent, when in fact such behavior is really not a choice.\n\nAnd how \u201ccamouflaging\u201d or \u201cmasking,\u201d terms used to describe ASD people pretending to naturally fit into a socially \u2018normal\u2019 environment, causes their already high anxiety and depression levels to further increase. Of course, this exacerbation is reflected in the disproportionately high rate of suicide among ASD people.\n\nAs for my own autism-spectrum-disordered brain, I'm sometimes told, \u201cBut you're so smart!\u201d To this I somewhat agitatedly reply: \"But for every 'gift' I have, there are a corresponding three or four deficits.\" It's crippling, and on multiple levels.\n\nThere could also be childrearing/parenting instruction in regards to children born with ASD, with the rate of such births increasing. Low-functioning autism is already readily recognized and treated, but higher-functioning ASD cases are basically left to fend for themselves.",

            "selftext": "Originally posted by u/aitagiftedschool in r/AmItheAsshole on April 11, '23 updated on April 19, '23.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMood Spoiler: >!Infuriating!<\n\n\n---\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**[Original](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12j4vto/aita_for_not_sending_my_daughter_to_a_different/)**\n\n\nApril 11, '23\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nAITA for not sending my daughter to a different school district so she could be in gifted education?\n\n\nI have 3 kids, Michelle (7), Juliet (6), and Leo (2). Michelle and Juliet are in kindergarten and first grade at our local public school. Juliet, however, is very gifted. She came into kindergarten reading chapter books and was doing math at a 2nd grade level. She\u2019s obviously doing great academically but struggles socially at her school for a couple reasons. Firstly, she doesn\u2019t understand that other people\u2019s brains don\u2019t work like hers and tends to get frustrated when people take a bit longer to figure things out. Second, she\u2019s just a huge bookworm and would rather spend recess reading instead of playing with the other kids, then she gets upset that she can\u2019t talk about her books with them.\n\n\nI was recently called into a meeting about Juliet with her teacher, the principal of her school, and the superintendent. They basically said that they don\u2019t have the resources to support Juliet in her school or any schools in the district but there\u2019s a school 2 towns over specifically for gifted students from 1st-10th grade, then for 11th and 12th grade, they have a building at a community college and she would be taking college courses for high school and college credit. She would have to test in to the school but her school will provide the testing. The school sounds great for her but it\u2019s close to 30 minutes away from her current school. It starts and ends 45 minutes later than her current school so I\u2019d still be able to get her and Michelle to school on time but it would eat up at least 2 extra hours of my day and I don\u2019t have that kind of time for school drop off and pickup, nor do I have the patience to deal with a 2 year old in the car for 2 hours per day. My husband works in the opposite direction and wouldn\u2019t be able to drop her off. We could ask my FIL, he sometimes drives the kids around for me but I don\u2019t want to have him do drop off and pickup 2 hours per day.\n\n\nMy husband does not agree with me at all. He thinks I should be willing to make the drive for her and insists that I have the time because I\u2019m a SAHM. I brought up the issue of having Leo spending that much time in the car but he says that I could just have his parents babysit.\n\n\nI still don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth the 2 hours per day that I\u2019d have to put in to take her to this school so I went through with enrolling her in our local public school for next year and my husband is furious with me for \u201cignoring her social and academic needs\u201d.\n\n\nAITA for not enrolling her in the gifted school because it would take too much time to get her to and from school?\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*In the comments:*\n\n\n>What does Juliet want?\n\n\nOP: Juliet doesn\u2019t know about any of this.\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n>Can the school offer school bus options?\n\n\nOP: They don\u2019t offer school busses\n\n\n.\n\n\n>YTA, sorry but we sacrifice for our children first and foremost. The \u201cI don\u2019t have the patience\u201d comment pushed it over the edge.\n\n\nOP: Do you want to sit in a car with a 2 year old for at least 3 hours per day (10-15 minutes to get Michelle to school, 30-40 minutes to get Juliet to school, 45 minutes to get home, then doing it all again a few hours later)\n\n.\n\n\n>You are a SAHM have you considered homeschooling? You could easily fit a curriculum to meet her needs and you would not have to spend all the time driving. I don't think YTA for not wanting to drive but you are a little bit for not considering your husband's wishes or looking for other options that will support her needs.\n\n\nOP: We tried that for a year with preschool and I couldn\u2019t handle homeschooling her.\n\n.\n\n\n>what is your plan to help her get the support she needs if she stays in her current school?\n\n\nOP: she works with a reading specialist 2 days a week and gets 2nd grade advanced math work to do in class.\n\n\nFrom what I understand, she doesn't go to the second grade class. Her teacher gives her the work to keep her occupied while she deals with the rest of the class and she goes to her teacher if she has questions.\n\n.\n\n\n>Why don't they just skip her a grade or 2? \n\n\nOP: Schools don\u2019t like to do that now.\n\n\n.\n\n\n>Honest question, what does your day look like? Do you run a business during the that occupies your time? What is an activity that is so productive and useful to you that you believe it is a better allocation of time instead of investing into your very gifted daughter\u2019s education?\n\n\nOP: Keeping a 2 year old boy alive.\n\n.\n\n\n>Is there any way they\u2019d accommodate Michelle too?\n\n\nOP: No. This school is just for gifted kids. I asked about sending Michelle there too and was pretty much told that she doesn\u2019t have a snowball\u2019s chance in hell of getting into that school.\n\n\n.\n\n\n*A bit more info from OP:*\n\n\nShe gets 2nd grade advanced math (what they give to the advanced 2nd graders) and works with a reading specialist twice a week.\n\n\nCarpool would be possible for Michelle. Juliet likely wouldn\u2019t be able to carpool due to the size of the school and the distance.\n\n\nI'm not denying her an education. I just don\u2019t have the time to take her to this school.\n\n\nMy husband won\u2019t be able to change his work schedule.\n\n\nI\u2019m not moving for an elementary school\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n*Judgment: Asshole*\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**[UPDATE: AITA for not sending my daughter to a different school district so she could be in gifted education?](https://www.reddit.com/user/aitagiftedschool/comments/12sgu2h/update_aita_for_not_sending_my_daughter_to_a/)**\n\n\nApril 19, '23\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\nI found out that my husband took Juliet to get tested for the gifted school behind my back and she got in.\n\n\nAfter he found out that she was accepted, he let our housekeepers go (we have housekeepers come twice a week) and canceled my gym membership to pay for a service to drive her to and from school, all without telling me.\n\n\nAs a result of his actions, I\u2019m currently staying with my parents and we will be getting a divorce.\n\n\nJuliet will be starting her new school in July (it\u2019s one of those year round schools) and my soon to be ex just had to tear our family apart to make it happen.\n\n\nI hope you\u2019re all happy with the outcome.\n\n\n\n*In the comments:*\n\n\n>So you want a divorce because your husband figured out the best way to help your child?\n\n\nOP: He can\u2019t make decisions about my life without consulting me\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n**Reminder, DO NOT comment on the original posts or contact the original poster.

            "title": "AITA for not giving my daughter her education fund money?",
            "selftext": "I (54M) have two children (23F and 21M) with my wife (52F). When the kids were young, my parents set up education funds for both of them, which was very generous of them.\n\nMy wife and I always expected our kids to attend college and then graduate school, as we have done. I have a PhD, my wife has a master's. Because of this, we decided not to use the funds for our kids' undergrad degrees and did not tell them about the money.\n\nMy daughter has always been more into the liberal arts, while my son is more of a STEM guy. My wife and I worried about her ability to find a job, but she insisted on studying music and film in college. She was accepted to some top schools and chose to attend a rather expensive one, but she had scholarships to cover almost all of her tuition. Everything else, plus living expenses, was her responsibility. She lived in a very small apartment shared with friends in a not-so-nice area far from campus, but she was fine and learned how to budget effectively. After graduating, she luckily found a job that doesn't pay extremely well but she enjoys, and scrapped the idea of grad school.\n\nMy son decided to do engineering, and he also expressed that he had no interest in grad school. My wife and I were disappointed, but accepted it since at this point he is already all set up with a very good job when he completes school. Since he did not receive as many scholarships as his sister, we decided to use his education fund to cover his tuition and living expenses. He was able to get a large and nice apartment of his own close to the school, which is important since his classes are so demanding and he needs a comfortable space to work.\n\nMy daughter was confused and asked how he could afford this, and he told her about the education fund. She called us and asked why she didn't have one, and we told her she did, we just didn't use it because we hoped she would attend grad school. She seemed hurt by this and asked if there was any way she could have the money now. We explained that there would be a fee to simply withdraw the money for non-education uses, and if we chose to do that it would belong to her grandparents so they could put it towards their own use. She's been quiet and short when answering our texts, and hasn't answered our calls at all since then. I know that it seems unfair to her, but it's not really her money in the first place and she's no longer in college. Plus, her brother only received it for educational purposes and it wouldn't be right for her to just have it to spend now. AITA?\n\nUPDATE: I understand the consensus is that my wife and I are the AH. I texted my daughter to ask if she wanted us to withdraw the money for her/what she wanted to do. This was her response: \"I don't care. Maybe they can transfer it to \\[other grandkid who is 5\\] if the fee is seriously too much. Idk about grad school I haven't thought about it much recently. If I do apply it wouldn't be for another couple years and I hadn't been counting on having any financial help in the first place so it really doesn't even matter. Thanks for asking tho.\"\n\nUPDATE 2: My wife and I are discussing our daughter's response and our next actions to resolve this situation. For context, my wife has always had a strained relationship with my daughter and did not approve of many of her life choices. She believes we should take our daughter's words at face value and assume she no longer wants the money. From some of the responses here, I fear that my daughter's response was out of resentment and I suggested taking out as much money as her brother was given so at least they received the same amount. She could use it responsibly towards rent, groceries, transportation, etc. or in some other way to further her career, so it would still be for \"educational\" purposes in a sense. My wife is standing firm in her opinion, and we will continue talking it through tomorrow. \n\nMany have asked about where my parents stand on this. At this point, they are not mentally aware enough to really participate in the discussion. They did know about our grad school stipulation and thought it was fine. They also knew that we took out some money for our son once we were certain he was not pursuing an advanced degree, and were fine with that as well. They said it was our decision as parents what to do with our daughter's fund, and they would support whatever we decided for her. It wouldn't be useful to ask them what to do with it now, but I have always said that whatever is unused will go back to their care. I have tried to call my daughter with no luck, which is why I sent the text. Despite what many have said here, I hope this does not end our relationship. ",

We always planned for our son to study abroad in a western country fo university since he was a child and this is expensive due to the high international tuition fees. This went as planned for my son.\n\nHowever ever since I got a laptop and phone with Internet, I have used it to learn new things on my own from sources like MIT courseware and youtube and I really wanted my daughter to be an educated woman. I also stopped believing in my religion while my husband is devout. I pretend to be religious and follow our customs for the sake of the marriage. I only have high school level education.\n\nThe plan for my daughter was to find a boy from a nice family for her to marry, and not go to university or to go to a local one if she wanted to.\n\nI convinced my husband that these days boys from good families want an educated woman for status reasons even if she does not work and that if our daughter had a western degree she could marry into an elite family. It worked and he paid for her to attend a top university which she got into which is actually better than the one my son went to.\n\nMy daughter after leaving also confided to me that she does not believe our religion anymore and started living a different lifestyle, one I can never have. She recently graduated, got a work visa and stayed in the western country and has a good job there.\n\nMy husband got really angry when he heard and is feeling really cheated and blames me as I pursuaded him to pay for her education and let her go. He even found a picture of her online of a university competition she did where she won a prize and posed for a picture without head covering.\n\nI am feeling a little guilty since it is his money that let her go to university and now we may not get to see her again. AITA?\n\nSorry for any mistakes, my English is not the best.",
