Much more common at the bottom though! These would be because of their sheer skill level, or even because of kindness or wholesomeness. \nThose would be the ones to stick with for sure. They would help you through any issues. And life would be okay.\n\n-\n\nSince you have a budding celeb, you probably won\u2019t know for a bit. \n\nOne indication that isn\u2019t good is your level of upset. There may be more you\u2019re not saying.\n\nOne indication it\u2019s just fine is that you mentioned mainly the actions of other people and women being the issue. That\u2019s not his problem.

Let's run through the major objections:\n\n1. \"I can't handle the jealousy!\" I'm not somebody for whom fidelity is an absolute deal breaker. \n\nIt's something I'll happily do for a partner, but if my partner wants/needs strange, I would only ask that they're safer with me and that we have a conversation about pregnancy before pregnancy becomes a thing and that they talk about it when they come home to me because that sounds hot.\n\n2. \"I don't want to live in my partner's shadow!\" I feel like I have a decent-sized profile in my own life and under my own name that a celebrity relationship or marriage would be comfortably shady, rather than an overpowering shadow. I do work that I enjoy that is in no way connected to performance or visual arts or music in *any* way and collaborating would likely be way too unwieldy to bother with. \n\nI'm my own person, and I'd do fine slightly more private. Hell, a little online discipline might even be good for me.\n\n3. \"They have easy access to whoever they want.\" Yeah, cool, bet. They want me, though. And if they don't, I get to move on with my life and with the added ego boost that I pulled a celebrity. How awesome is that?\n\n4. \"The power differential is so big!\" Refer to point 2. I think we can keep it civil for both of our sakes. We're both ambitious people who rely on our reputations.\n\nLike, if I was uncommitted and managed to have a meaningful connection with anybody, I would *love* to see where it went, and I have an established weakness for ambitious women.\n\nLike I'm not saying I can charm Taylor Swift, but if homegirl wanted material for her next album, I would absolutely volunteer as tribute.",

So I was serious about it and couldn't imagine ever doing anything else.\n\nLooking back I can't thank heavens enough I found another passion in a traditional corporate field. I could never handle being famous, always needing security to go anywhere, have people track my every move, having to give up my personality and dignity to be more marketable, travelling all the time, the disgusting comments on social media or tabloid gossip.

Not to mention the amount of praise they get and how people idealise them - when you know who they _actually_ are behind close doors and how they treat people. Neither of these men were a \u201cbad person\u201d, but if their fans knew how narcissistic, entitled and selfish they are irl they\u2019d feel a lot  of cognitive dissonance.

And you'd be seeing them everywhere too.  Hell, at my office, two people are dating each other and if they break up, it's going to really suck for them because the gossip mill is atrocious and they work together.

I took a very light touch- I was terrified of seeming too keen so played it very cool. I thought that she was entirely used to being fawned over for her looks so took care to praise her intellect and humour more- as a way of marking myself as different from her fans. I think I also stopped myself from ever imagining that the relationship would last as a self defence tactic against getting hurt. From my perspective, it was just cool that I got to see her naked when people were buying magazines with her picture in! Probably helped that she actually wasn\u2019t as attractive as my ex and often expressed insecurity herself. Ended on good terms when she moved cities.

Some of the riffs and ideas of the album are super cool. I mean, just listen to the outro and solo on \u201cWhite Walls.\u201d That entire sequence is fucking sick. It\u2019s also clear that, throughout the album, BTBAM\u2019s got chops. They play fast, they play technical, and they play tight. As a musician, myself, they\u2019re considerably impressive. BUT\u2026\n\nOne thing I can\u2019t extol is the way they string along these cool ideas: Every sequence seems as though an Island\u2013miles apart from each other concerning continuity despite their contiguity. It doesn\u2019t help that they don\u2019t adhere to verse-chorus structure. Now, mind you, it\u2019s not a downside to not adhere to verse-chorus structure; hell, one of my favorite bands Deathspell Omega (check the flair buddy) shirks any semblance of verse-chorus structure. What BTBAM fails to do is to justify this type of songwriting because they fail to leverage great use of dynamics and continuity. Most of the time, the songs of *Colors* have little contrast in dynamics. Everything tends to meander and blend together especially when BTBAM is indulging in tech-death riffing and when they do create sections different and contrasting to their tech-death/core riffing style, they make sections and interludes so tonally dissonant and unjustified that I can\u2019t help but be frustrated by it. Just look at the hoedown/western bar section close to the end of \u201cAnts of the Sky.\u201d It\u2019s not fun, it\u2019s tone-destroying and thematically-compromising (concerning musical themes, not lyrical themes though I doubt the lyrics somehow justify this either) and I can\u2019t believe that we give *Colors* a pass but vote out Mr. Bungle for being \u201cquirky.\u201d *Colors* has the exact same problem and it should be treated the same way as Mr. Bungle.",

I cannot stop drinking it and it all started with a Chuu ad. Oh my god their plan worked exactly how it was supposed to. \n\nAND THE COCOMONG DRINK. Cocomong is a kids show. Only kids would want that drink. The solution? Collaboration. Cocomong collabing with Loona was just done for orbits to like Cocomong and vice versa. Now that Cocomong has become a meme in the orbit community, and that is what drove me to buy that drink, THEY DID EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANTED ME TO DO. COCOMONG USED LOONA, TO REACH ME, AN ORBIT, TO BUY A DAMN DRINK MARKETED FOR CHILDREN.\n\nAnyway has this ever happened to you with kpop ads :) it\u2019s similar to the Twice qoo but not really. only another orbit would know why there are bottles of pocari sweat all over my room. :) it\u2019s basically unofficial merch I think kinda",

                "I'm extremely stingy with my money so advertising just doesn't work on me. I buy what I need and that's it.\n\nIf I had more money and it didn't matter, I would 100% buy a lot of clothes idols wear. There's so many outfits I see that I love and wish I could have too. Idk if this really counts cause it's not a direct advertisement (usually), but I guess they are sort of modelling for them too.",

Can't say all of them worked for me, but there are some I added to my skincare routine. \n\nThe only time I deliberately decided to buy something because of an idol was when Suho became the brand ambassador for Montes Wines. Turns out it's a very good wine within my price range, so I still occasionally buy it.\n\nBut also this whole topic reminds me of the time [Baekhyun shoved a box of tissues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVtkUWEFBqM) off his sofa when a fan joked that those tissues will be sold out now.",

Or when I need a new phone or shoes e.g. I'd consider a brand they're endorsing (my BTS puma shoes were great, or my Samsung buds), but whether I buy anything depends on whether I genuinely like it. They're endorsing a lot of ridiculously expensive brands lately, so that makes the decision easier (I did consider a Bottega Veneta bag because of Namjoon, but eventually decided I didn't like the brand all that much to be spending that much on a bag).",

I found it in a small Chinese market when I was on vacation, so I bought it. It was fine. \n\nI tend to really only buy advertising when it's for foods or drinks. For example, I bought those self-heating hotpots and Meco tea due to constant PPL in Chinese dramas. I actually really enjoy Meco tea though (the pomegranate and grapefruit one), so I consider it a win. \n\nAlso not kpop and not me, but my mom is such a victim to PPL in K-dramas.

                "I would walk past a MAC store everyday when going to work, and there was this huge picture of Lisa in the window. Her lipstick was super pretty. If it had been anyone else, or a random model, I probably wouldn't have paid attention. But because it was Lisa and I do like Blackpink, my eyes always went to Lisa, it was almost like she was greeting me on the way to work ahah. And she looked soooo cute on the picture. You guessed it : at some point I stopped and went in to buy the lipstick (if anyone is wondering it's the Powder Kiss lipstick in shade Mull It Over). I don't regret it because the colour looks very nice on me too and I love it. But yes, Lisa made me buy lipstick.\n\nAlso, when the 1st teaser for Jihyo's solo was released it was just a picture of her hands on the driving wheel, but her nail colour was soooo pretty that that the next day I went to the shop to buy a similar one (I don't have it with me right now but I think the one I got was OPI's Charge it to their room). It's not \"Jihyo's nail polish\" or anything because it wasn't an ad and I don't know what actual product she used but still : Jihyo created a need for me to immediately go and buy blue nail polish (I don't regret it either, it looks lovely!)\n\nI think a lot of people believe celebrity marketing = I want to wear the same thing as my favs. It's probably true to an extent, but I belive it's more about the exposure : if a random model was wearing it you wouldn't look at the picture twice. But because it's someone familiar, someone that you like and admire, you notice and pay more attention to it. You think \"what a queen, that looks sooo pretty on her \ud83e\udd70\"... until a little voice in your head starts whipering \"maybe that would look pretty on me too???\"",

They might be rich, but they're not magic.\n\nJust like some of the scammy fundraisers popping up, gotta take time and make sure money and help is going to the right place, otherwise it's wasted anyway.\n\nFrom a logistics standpoint, even if I had a billion dollars, I would say I'd have to talk with the Accountant, a lawyer, and maybe someone connected in the Aid circles. Talk it over, and see what's the best/most efficient way to help. Plus move money around so that you can donate effectively. Believe it or not, most billionaires dont have all their money just chilling in a checking account. All of this would take at least a day.\n\nThere's more to it than just \"throw money at it\".  That's one way to help.  But what if a better way to help might be to set up a trust fund of some sort for victims?  Or find out where each donation is going so you can properly allocate money to get the aid to where it's needed ASAP, rather than it funneling through a general fund or something.  Or even use their connections at retail companies to solicit donations/products for the affected people.",

And even if the recipient is well-connected in community, it\u2019ll take them days if not weeks to assess the damage and figure out where to move that money effectively. \n\nIn the time that takes, Oprah will earn back WAY more money via her investments in the stock market \u2014 which are likely largely invested in major corporations that are disproportionately responsible for the colonialism and climate change and inequality and over-tourism that led to the fires in the first place. \n\nShe literally cannot give money away fast enough even if she wanted to. \n\nMost of these billionaires aren\u2019t even evil people, but the health of our people and the \u02bb\u0101ina should not depend on them being angels.",

Got to pitch some YouTube ideas to Matt Cutshall (who had organized the entire event).\n- I rode the elevator with ~20 band members\n- I played blackjack with probably 15 of the band members.\n- The last person I talked to (in the parking lot) was the lead singer of New Found Glory.\n- The Plain White Ts concert overlapped with Hawthorne Heights one night\u2026 so I came in late and was standing in the back of the club for Hawthorne Heights. A couple members from Plain White Ts ended up doing the same. Ended up jamming out with the Plain White Ts for 30ish minutes.",

By night 2, he found a groupie almost old enough to be his daughter to hang out with him the entire week.\n\neta: At this time in our lives, we took cheap vacations.  This was on the Paradise, an older ship built before balconies were common, and I think our ocean view room was probably about $1000 all in, including 2 young children.

She gave me the title of one of her books and I bought it, showing her how easy it was to buy books on a kindle. About a month later her publisher decided not to sell on kindle.

Another near miss was an off the grid camp in AK, where we saw Secret Service arriving to do security sweep for former POTUS Jimmy and former FLOTUS Rosalyn ahead of their visit the week after we left. \n\nSpeaking of politicians, Hubby literally ran into Mitt Romney coming out of a restaurant on a narrow north end Boston side walk, luckily it was before he\u2019d been assigned SS, so he just apologized. \ud83d\ude33\n\nI think most people who are widely recognizable wouldn\u2019t be able to relax if they were on a mass market cruise ship.

It\u2019s still funny, but it is the start of the decline where great episodes become less and less frequent.

What we mean is that nothing can truly be taken out, the mythology is fluid and often contradictory, you'll get a million origin stories but no resolution.   This episode is clearly the beginning of that.  Up to this point,  simpsons story telling had been consistent, nothing really contradicting or retreding origins that had already been explained.

We should not care if they are just living their lives and not trying to persuade everyone they're good, worthy people to emulate. If they are trying to do that, we should care.\n3. We should extend this list beyond cheating on their partner and applying the rule to most things about celebrities. I don't care that Tom Cruise is a scientologist as long as he's minding his own business. Once he starts trying to sell the idea of himself as a brand representing an awesome, cool person we should emulate and buy products endorsed by, and listen to - then I would care a lot what kind of demented and warped things he believes.

Most celebrities don't do that because they know they're pieces of shit and their lifestyle goes away once the populace finds out.\n\nSo yea, out them every chance you get.

This also includes accounts that post explicit content anywhere else on Reddit.\n\n\nPlease do not SPAM the group with reposts. This means posting a new pic when you've recently posted, or deleting your old post and reposting a new pic a day or two later, especially if you've not interacted with guessers in the first post (aka you're farming karma). We do notice, and that will result in a temporary or permanent ban, depending on how grouchy your mod team is that day.\n\n\nPlease REPORT comments on your post that are creepy, insulting, harassing, comment on your appearance (positive or negative) or otherwise shitty. We do take them seriously and will ban people who behave like this, with no exceptions.\n\n\nWe will delete any posts where we suspect you are posting someone else's photo. You will be banned and asked to provide a verification picture to remove the ban. (Screenshots are a big red flag).\n\n\nDo not engage with trolls - two wrongs do not make a right.

Gaga and other celebrities have been seen and photographed at events with occult leaders such as Marina Abromavic acknowledging satanic occult activity. Marina has been photographed with Rothchilds posing in front of portraits depicting Satan commanding his legions while openly discussing ritual blood sacrifices. There are images of her \u201cart\u201d depicting this. \n\nThere are interviews from many celebrities such as Mel Gibson, Dave Chappelle and countless rappers depicting Hollywood parties and underage teens being handed out like party favors on YouTube. Reports from former child actors from Disney, Nickelodeon and others describing abuse they took and witnessed throughout the years in books.\n\nThere are images and reports from related military and political figures that tie in government programs and agencies to these Hollywood activities. While much of it has been scrubbed, some does still exist, yet many here chastise or mock the info along with those that share it.\n\nWhat about events such as the Olympic Ceremonies, Super Bowl Halftime Shows and CERN Ceremonies?

Also, most people who are willing to put in that kind of time and effort into a religious practice are not going to be using it to procure small children to eat.

I think it's really hard for people to identify money as evil because in America, most anybody has the idea that they can become a rock star or a millionaire if they try hard enough. I don't remember who said it, but there's a quote about poor and average americans all being temporarily embarrassed millionaires. Most middle class people have more in common with a homeless person doing heroin in the middle of the street, then they do with Lady Gaga or Bill Cosby.

I see people telling her that she should be gracious and grateful that she still have fans, that she'll be nothing without her fans. Excuse me, she's Lea Salonga.",
                "social media has definitely created a warped sense of access.",
                "I think social media just lets some fans feel closer to strangers than they should, as if they're an actual part of their lives. It's really not okay, and it sucks that it makes some people feel entitled to more and more of whoever it is they're following's lives",

It\u2019s manipulative on the part of celebrities to encourage the idea that their fans are their friends and unhealthy for fans to feel like they \u201cknow\u201d them, no matter how much exposure they might get.",
                "What people are missing is that there is simply no place or air to have this conversation or shift in the culture done politely and maturely. Is Doja being an asshole about it? Absolutely, 100%. Is she pushing in the right direction? I think she is, all things considered. \n\nHowever, this is not a conversation that you can have politely with your fans (or *any* fandom at all) without people absolutely melting down crying that an artist owes absolutely everything to their fans and that therefore they are obligated for eternity to play the smiley and affably compliant meat puppet role whenever they meet/interact or else. \n\nThe nature of the artist-fan relationship is of course transactional: I produce this content you like, you pay me for it. You should respect me and my art, and I should show a certain amount of gratitude for enjoying it. But above everything else, you are two absolute strangers that know next to nothing about each other, and thus your boundaries should be fairly similar to dealing with an absolute random on the street: you are owed basic respect, but you are not owed a selfie or autograph or anything beyond a polite smile and thank you.",
                "Omg as if a customer service role is anything like being a celebrity \ud83d\ude02 \n\nPutting oneself in the public eye makes one a public commodity for better or worse. This isn't new, it's the double edged sword of human nature.\n\nIf celebs are unhappy or lack the grace to understand this aspect of their careers then maybe they should get different jobs \ud83e\udd37",

It\u2019s just always seemed disingenuous but people ate it up and would get mad if a celebrity didn\u2019t announce their undying love for strangers who are obsessed with them. Not that celebrities should be rude to fans, but there can be a healthy balance of appreciating your fans without trying to create a parasocial relationship.",
                "Hmm while i do understand the hate of stan culture. These celebs are using our love for them to buy merch, tickets and support them. If they didnt have that kind of love they would not be as wealthy or famous as they are. People like you and i dont have careers that are so dependent on people truly caring about us. So i think its a bit unfair for people like Doja to complain. For me as long as fans are not physically harming/harassing anyone because of their love, theres nothing wrong with being a stan.",
                "I agree/disagree. It\u2019s one thing to be private. You don\u2019t share anything about your life. You don\u2019t have social media, or you have your social media accounts private. But when you are actively on social media, where you get paid/rewarded for having followers etc you can\u2019t also tell your followers you don\u2019t care about them or owe them anything. Idk. If that\u2019s how you feel then go private. Jennifer Lawrence did that for example. But if feels exploitative to want more fans/followers then belittle them. Of course there are the extreme fans that need to be set straight but I\u2019m talking about regular fans.",
                "How does this work? If people don't care about them, how do they become celebrities?",
                "I'm with you. People, particularly stans, have gotten used to celebrities bending under their will. It absolutely bothers ppl that they can't control Doja with unfollowing/threats of not listening to music/bad press/etc. Doja really doesn't care and her last song release still did well, tour still sold well, and we'll see how much she's been affected with her upcoming song release later this week (I think it'll do fine). \n\nSure, she didn't do it in the best way, but people need to realize that she doesn't owe anyone anything and she fully understands that you are not obligated to support her, either.\n\nI love her music, don't know her as a person, but I'm still going to listen.",
                "I don't really care that they don't give a fuck, but when they're like really disrespectful, and bite the hand that feeds them I just think that is just a reflection of their character and an ick one. Like we can all clown on Taylor Swift for example --- but you'll never hear a bad story of Taylor ever taking it out on her fans, or ever being rude to them. I noticed the more they respect the fans too (like Taylor) the more those celebs are rewarded and succeed.\n\nDoja gave me major ick, and that's all for her goofy predator Minecraft head boyfriend.",

Same goes to customers. Once I\u2019ve clocked out, I don\u2019t know you.",
                "I do think we have entered an era on the flip side of celebrities not taking their jobs as seriously for the price paid. While there are some celebrities who will do everything they can to make sure fans have a great experience, we are also hearing a lot more about musicians cutting shows short, showing up late, not showing up at all, and giving a really low-energy performance. While you don 't owe anyone anything outside of your job, if you're charging $500 a ticket, you better be giving a performance worthy of that price point. You don't owe fans anything outside of your job, but there is a bare minimum that some performers are not meeting performance-wise. I'm not saying everyone needs a 4+ hour meet and greet post show, but showing up on time and doing your job should be the standard.",
                "I mean, ostensibly, I get it... but they're not regular people and this is not regular work. They thrive because of people's parasocial attachment to them.\n\n Like, no offense, but there are a bunch of white women who have equable talent to taylor swift and could make her art no problem with the right resources. People love TS because of who she is and the life she has lived publicly. There are a bunch more weirdo/internet obsessed Black girls that could do Doja easily. Go to a church in the south and there are plenty of choir girls who can sing like Beyonce. A decent high school theater program could produce another Ariana. These women are special for reasons beyond their art. \n\nI do not think this is solely an issue of art because people like celebs for more than just their art. Arguably, many are attached to the person, more than the art itself.",
                "There might tremendous bad will from their fan base, like Doja Cat, & not sell albums eventually. Might take a few years, but people will get turned off.",

                "I think with celebs there's a difference between love and appreciation. I believe all fans want is to be appreciated for spending $$$$ on concerts, merch, music etc. \"Love\" isn't really the right word. Value, appreciate, cherish, acknowledge, all words that would work better than love.",
                "She could've just gave a generic reply, like I love that all my fans support me so much, thank you. How hard would that have been? Don't shit where you eat, Doja.",
                "I absolutely love this switch in our culture too. The only people who have a problem with this are people who lack empathy. Sorry, but it\u2019s the truth",
                "I blame the Gaga/Katy Perry/Taylor era where they made their fans believe they were entitled to more and had a relationship of any sorts with them. The reality is that this isn\u2019t the case. \n\nIt worked for their brands and allowed them to have a really loyal following but now looking at it as an adult I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s healthy. Love the music, go to the concert, watch the video, but it doesn\u2019t go beyond that",
                "Artists have always been there. And we\u2019ve had a lot of artists like this. No one is sad about that. What they\u2019re sad about is the disrespect the artist is throwing their way.",

If you are a genre fiction fan who hasn't read any Cormac, you have got to read this book. Gripping, disturbing, deeply emotional, and hopeful all at once!",
            "selftext": "The Road is an unforgettable story about a man and his son trying to survive nuclear winter. Talented doesn't even begin to describe McCarthy as a writer - If you love to read, I truly believe you have to add at least one of his books to your bucket list, and this is one of his best.\n\nNo spoilers setup (but still in spoiler tags in case you like to go in totally blind): \n\n>!The bombs fell, and the world ended.\r It grew darker, and colder, and more violent. The new world was grim and grey and relentless. \r!<\n\n>!A man and his young son had to set out on the road, alone, heading south.\r The road, though, is dangerous. Cannibals and slavers and men driven mad with hunger roam the hills.\r Even if the man can avoid marauders, will he be clever and lucky enough to find food and supplies in the picked-over remains of civilization to feed his son?\r And every day that they survive, they have to ask themselves if it is worth surviving. What awaits them in the south, on the coast?!<\r\n\nFirst off, I have to talk about McCarthy's writing style. He just gives you a feeling. Somehow the spare writing and short sentences fill you with a feeling of grey and wet and cold that will never end - it's so much stronger than any book has a write to be. (This is also one of McCarthy's hallmarks - it's different feelings in each book, but you can't read his books without feeling it).\r\n\nHe also writes incredible, hyper-realistic dialogue that on its own is totally enough to understand the characters in a very deep way. Interestingly, he doesn't use quotation marks or tell you who\u2019s talking (e.g., no 'so and so said'). Sometimes it can be confusing for a moment, but like a lot of literary writing, just keep reading and let it wash over you - it usually comes clear soon (and it helps create that crazy sense of immersion).\n\nCormac is probably my favorite writer of all time, and I hope you can check him out and experience what he's like. The Road is dark and terrifying and beautiful and full of grit and hope all at once. He\u2019s a genius.\n\nPS Part of an ongoing series of posts about the best sci-fi books of all time for the Hugonauts.

                "I definitely need to give him another try. Tried reading *The Road* and could not get into it at all. Read all of *Child of God* and hated it.",
                "And read it now in summer when we have lots of sunshine! Reading The Road in the winter is just signing yourself for depression in my opinion.",
                "As I've said here before, The Road left me so completely disturbed and unsettled that I stopped reading fiction for nearly a decade, and novels for even longer.",
                ">The bombs fell, and the world ended.\n\nIs that from the book jacket blurb? McCarthy seemed to go out of his way to not explain what happened; it's seemingly not of interest to him, or he didn't want the reader focusing on it. The only line in the book describing what The Man witnessed:\n\n\u201cA long shear of light and then a series of low concussions.\u201d",
                "Literally finished the book a few minutes ago and then I saw this! Also weird that I went to look up where Cormac McCarthy was from when I started reading, only to learn he had died a few days prior.",
                "I couldn\u2019t stand this book. It\u2019s so pretentiously written with unnecessary, over the top descriptions. The lack of quotation marks for dialogue is just annoying. Would not recommend this book.",
                "I read No Country when I was in jail (as already a fan of the movie and could essentially quote it line for line) and I was GLUED front to back. I think i cleared in less than a few hours. I got home and immediately purchased Blood Meridian which ive not sat down and read yet. Only two chapters but you can tell its got all the hallmarks of McCarthy",
                "\"He walked out in the gray light and stood and he saw for a brief moment the absolute truth of the world. The cold relentless circling of the intestate earth. Darkness implacable. The blind dogs of the sun in their running. The crushing black vacuum of the universe. And somewhere two hunted animals trembling like ground-foxes in their cover. Borrowed time and borrowed world and borrowed eyes with which to sorrow it.\"",
                "Yo what. This is how I find out Cormac passed? I just looked him up last month or so and he was alive.",
                "\"hyper-realistic dialogue\"\n\n(sources needed)",
                "This book made me *feel* so cold I had to finish reading it in a hot bath.",
                "He died a month after I read The Road, it was the first book from him that I read. Amazing book. I already have Blood Meridian also in the pile. Rest in peace.",
                "The novel is a challenge to the idea that all a novel needs to do is entertain its reader. \n\n*The Road* is an uncomfortable read, challenging not in its complexity but its premise and tone. Even its style, spare of punctuation or quotation, fosters in me a desire for order, for things that are not possible anymore in the situation his characters are stuck in. Nor does it undercut itself, offering an unambiguous hope, a colony of good folk, or anything like that. \n\nI often compare it with *The Postman* by David Brin. Brin is a straightforward SF novelist. *The Postman* contains a clear plot that offers a lot of detail about how the world fell, how its factions (including the Holnists, the survivalist militia) have shaped the present, and how its main character and the groups he encounters can band together to make a new future. Brin highlighted the resilience of community and of narratives - even untrue ones like the *postman* persona and the *Cyclops -* against the forces that would try to tear it apart. That was fresh in the 1980s, when the dominant image of the post-apocalypse was basically societal disintegration.\n\nMcCarthy's vision is more dour even than the Mad Max versions of the apocalypse, where maybe small communities can preserve themselves and win the day. For McCarthy's characters, the pieces cannot be put together again. What hope there is is small - the man must protect the boy, the boy must believe there is something to being good even in this broken world, and *maybe* the family he meets at the end isn't all bad and can keep him - them - going a little longer.",
                "Honestly the ending didnt do it for me >!the deus ex machina feeling of it all just kind of felt cheap as fuck to me. I would have liked it better if the book just ended when the dad died, or if they had literally any reason to believe there was some good still in the world !< McCarthy is now 2/2 on books endings that I fucking hated. No Countries, while I understand what he was trying to do, just fucking sucked. >!70 pages of an old man rambling about this country going to shit after an absolute thriller of a novel that precedes it!< I am going to give him one more go with Blood Meridian, and hopefully something is there, because otherwise I'm just gonna drop the author",
                "I felt like this book was severaly over-hyped. The writing style wasn't as profound as I expected from McCarthy, it was something anyone could do. His imagery and prose were phenomenal for sure but the content of the book itself was super lackluster. It was the most benign \"journey\" I've ever read. Parts of difficulty immediately followed by parts of solace. Finding a completely unused bunker in the middle of an apocalypse with enough water to last for like 2 weeks, conveniently when the plot point of running out of water was starting to reach a head? Wow, really gripping. Then the ending, for a \"science fiction\" book having the main mcguffin in the \"Fire\" be a nothingburger just felt out of place. There are some things that stick with me about this book but for the most part I really did not enjoy it.",
                "I read the entire book within a day, I was so hooked. And as a function writer student it made a huge impact on my future writing.",
                "I am reading this right now. It is unreal!",
                "Yes.\n\nThe Road stayed with me for a long time after I read it - 3x - God he was great.",
                "The Road is like when you play Fallout and you spend half the game rummaging through empty houses picking up cans of beans and screwdrivers, and in the next house you find a can of tuna, and there's a guy upstairs so you shoot him. And the annoying part is, you have a kid with you, so you have to find twice of everything because he keeps opening his mouth and eating.",
                "Sorry, but he is very overrated by usofans. He is not that popular outside US of A. I do not think that he is bad, but I saw some comparing him to Thomas Pynchon and Don DeLillo and that is absurd, because these both are kilometers better than McCarthy.",
                "> First off, I have to talk about McCarthy's writing style. **He just gives you a feeling.** Somehow the spare writing and short sentences fill you with a feeling of grey and wet and cold that will never end - **it's so much stronger than any book has a write to be.** (This is also one of McCarthy's hallmarks - it's different feelings in each book, but you can't read his books without feeling it).\n\n> **He also writes incredible, hyper-realistic dialogue** that on its own is totally enough to understand the characters in a very deep way. Interestingly, he doesn't use quotation marks or tell you who\u2019s talking (e.g., no 'so and so said'). Sometimes it can be confusing for a moment, but like a lot of literary writing, just keep reading and let it wash over you - it usually comes clear soon (and **it helps create that crazy sense of immersion**).\n\nYea, I'm just going to have to disagree with you here.  What's the opposite of immersion?  Because whatever that is, McCarthy delivers in spades.  His style in no way promotes immersion, rather it takes you out of immersion because it's very different from common writing styles.  His staccato style of stream of consciousness works for spoken word and some poetry, but, honestly, it doesn't do McCarthy's imagination justice",
                "Never in history has any author heaped so much abuse on the word \"and.\"\n\n\"He got up from the bed and he put on his boots and he lifted the coffee cup and he drank and he swallowed and he found he had swallowed a dead fly that had drowned in the cold cold coffee sometime in the night. The fly was his penance.\"\n\nIf Cormac McCarthy had ever discovered the thing called *punctuation*, I might agree with you. Instead? Pretentious and insufferable.",
                "I read this book in one sitting over a grey Sunday afternoon and it absolutely WRECKED me. That was before I had kids and just the thought of reading it again with that added connection is enough to make me want to throw my copy in the river when I get home today.",
                "Dude was a hell of an author for sure.\n\nSadly I had to toss my copy of Blood Meridian, it had almost no punctuation, surely some kind of typographical error on the part of the publisher.",
                "One of my favorite quotes from The Road is,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We forget the things we wish to remember and remember the things we wish to forget\".",
                "The Road is one of my favorite books!\n\nIt's amazing how descriptive McCarthy was in describing grey!",
                "I saw half the movie until the DVD crapped out (bootleg DVD).\n\nI wanted to see the rest of it, although it seem depressing as hell. I have the audio book, might give it a listen.",
                "I got so pissed off that there were no names.  I stopped reading it.",
                "I have a hard time visualising scenes from books while reading, with the exception of McCarthy's books. No extra words.",
                "I have read The Road, and I just read the Passenger. Such a strange but enthralling read; I\u2019ve never read anything like it. Rest in peace.",
                "I wish I could read his books for the first time all over again.",
                "Is it a pretty tough read?",
                "I am about the finish \"Blood Meridian\" and can't recommend it enough. I also recently re-read \"No Country For Old Men\" after, probably over a decade and it definitely hits harder as I am now older.          \nI read The Road probably over a decade ago too, and I have seen the movie. That one....I love it. But, personally, after having my own Father pass on, it's extremely difficult to touch again. Sometimes I'll catch a bit of the movie and it's tough.          \nMy own Father had a certain Midwest Sensibility and \"Folkiness\" that I feel, IMO, McCarthy touched on.           \nI want to read \"Outer Dark\" but I think I need a Cormac break once I am done with \"Blood Meridian\".          \nHis prose is very poetic, quite literally especially when he doesn't use or uses very little punctuation.  It's descriptions, it's painting a scene with words in a way that I can't think of from another writer.                \nI'm glad you are enjoying him OP. He certainly comes up frequently in here, lol.",
                "I read The Road all in one shot on a flight from Dallas to Seattle. It's one of the best books I've ever read.",
                "The scariest book I ever read",
                "Great read. First one I read. Surprised how spare his style was after I went back and read Suttree, which is way different and funny as hell in parts. It's like Joyce, Proust, and Faulker had a love child. His vocabulary is off the charts.",
                "Oh I didn't even know he died, I only just read Blood Meridian, didn't like it much but I was going to look into the Road next. I guess that explains why his stuff has been front and center everywhere I looked for books to read lately.",
                "Why didn't they leave the road? Because everything was on fire.",
                "He's also my favorite author. I bought and started reading Suttree when he passed, Blood Meridian is probably my favorite though.",
                "That was a brutal book. Very disturbing.",
                "I read this book on a trip home to the UK with my son\u2026. Shook me to my core. I still feel I have some trauma from that book even after like 12 years or something.\n\nGreat read! Lol",
                "This is the only book I have read twice",
                "If I were to recommend a McCarthy book to someone who'd never read one...\n\nMy first was also the road, but when I read it, I did not not understand it fully, and it just seemed like a horrifically depressing book. but due to my own personal eccentricities, i was drawn to his writing, because I wanted to understand it. and so i continued with his books.\n\nnow, if i were to recommend a book... Suttree. it is a relatively lighthearted story, with some very funny moments, but an overall sad tone. it gives you a better chance to connect with his style of communication and writing. watermelons!\n\nanother good first book is all the pretty horses. it's a more plot driven book, but it does two important things: viscerally strong characterization, and exposure to weird language you don't hear today. and its a fun read.\n\nif someone perhaps wants to venture deeper into the darkness... one can only recommend blood meridian.\n\nthe road is a good story. but i still think, even after reading it years later, that it is even more depressing than blood meridian, no country for old men, or any of his other books.",
                "I'll definitely have to look at this for my next audiobook.  Since cancelling Audible, in the past two days I've gotten offers for both a free title to come back, and another for $.99/mo for 3 months 2 days later.",
                "A man I met on Postcard app suggested me this book and I loved it.",
                "I\u2019m glad you mentioned hopeful. The hope was my big takeaway from the book. I felt like the movie missed the mark.",
                "Incredible book. I have no desire to read it again. I felt this book for weeks after reading it.",
                "I hate this book with a passion; I also love this book with a passion.",
                "Is there a best book of his to read first?\n\nA friend suggested Suttree, which I tried, hated and abandoned after about 20 pages. \n\nI found it absolutely dripping with adjectives and adverbs. Are all his books like that? \n\nIt's subjective. I just didn't like the style.",
                "William Gay. Nocturne.",
                "McCarthy's death hit me pretty hard too. His books aren't always easy to read. Sometimes they are hauntingly beautiful. Frequently they are sharp and brutal. Every word he put to paper seems set as firm as if it were carved in stone.  \nThe Road is especially hard. It's not a reality easily dismissed when Canada is on fire.",
                "I would add it\u2019s not necessarily a nuclear winter. It don\u2019t think it specifically says that ( I could be wrong) but leaves it vague and unexplained, Which makes it all the more horrifying.",
                "I just went to libby to reserve the audiobook and it says \"18 weeks\" to get it.\n\nAfter I finish my current one I may just have to buy it.",
                "When I finished this book I fell into an evening of sadness that took me days to climb out of. Beautiful and moving read, and I dare not re read it as a father now.",

                "His last two novels are definitely worth reading. He basically wrote his own eulogy.",
                "The Road is such a great book and I recommend it to everyone. I lent it to my dad and it creep the \ud83d\udca9 out of him, although it did get him to become a fan of McCarthy.\n\nI plan on reading The Passenger next month.",

It\u2019s honestly the only thing I\u2019ve read by him.\n\nAn acquaintance mentioned that he believes that him getting the literary Pulitzer for it was more of a lifetime achievement award and that he really deserved it for Blood Meridian. Tbh, I\u2019m working a lot (1 FT, 2 PT) but I\u2019ve been trying to find time to read Blood Meridian.",
                "The Road was harder for me to read (emotionally) than Blood Meridian, and that's saying something. It's devestating but so well-written.",
                "I'm not saying this to be a dick at all, but this is really weird for me because I thought he died years ago. This is some more Bernstein bears shit.",

                "I watched the Road when i was in my 20's. I remember it being an amazing film, but one that i never wanted to watch again because of how devastating it was.  \n\ni imagine the book is even more powerful.",

When I was in high school, one of my teachers (who was  either pregnant or had just given birth) brought it in and told me to take it because she couldn't finish it... something about it horrified her so much she threw it across the room. I was very into fantasy at the time and it seemed way out of my genre/style, so I barely even cracked it... but any time someone brings it up, I kick myself a bit.",
                "Oh wow... I didn't know he died...\n\nI definitely like *The Road*. I read it in two different college classes and enjoyed it both times. As you mention, a lot of emotions all at once.",
                "I think I watched the movie based on the book which is a real shame. Great movie I really enjoyed it but I was disappointed that it was from a book as I feel that books really are light years ahead of movies and would love to have heard about then read the book first before watching the film.",

                "Years ago I went to see EQUUS (with Daniel Radcliffe) on Broadway. \n\nIt was a SENSATION at the time. \n\nThis was the first real role that Daniel Radcliffe had taken on after the HARRY POTTER movies, and no one was sure if he was a real actor yet. And the play itself is VERY challenging; it's very emotoinally charged, and complex---sick, in a number of ways---and it also (notoriously) requires Daniel's character to be totally naked on stage for some time. \n\nSo combine all these things---Radcliffe himself at the height of his HARRY POTTER fame; the challenging nature of the play; the big question about Daniel Radcliffe's acting chops; and Radcliffean penis dangling and bopping around stage live and in real time---and you have quite an intoxicating cocktail of obsession for his fans. \n\nThe sidewalk outside was thronged with  crowds of people waiting for Daniel Radcliffe to come out of the theater afterwards. \n\nIt was like Beatlemania.\n\nI just so happened to be friends with his co-star, Richard Griffiths (who also played the execrable Uncle Dursley from the movies). \n\nAfter the play (which was AMAZING---Radcliffe was just fantastic; it was one of my favorite Broadway experiences) I went backstage to meet Richard and his wife. \n\nWe shot the shit for a few minutes in the dressing room then we decided to leave for dinner. We had a car waiting for us. \n\nNaturally, we used the same stage door that Daniel would use. \n\nBut we left first. \n\nOr I should say:\n\nI left first.\n\nI just happened to be the first guy out the door. \n\nAaaaaaand . . .\n\nI happen to look a bit like Daniel Radcliffe. \n\nI'm 5'10\".\n\nI'm white.\n\nI have short brown hair. \n\nI have a similar build. \n\nIf you saw us side-by-side in a well-lit room, there would be no confusion; you'd know who was who.\n\nBut if you were a rabid Radcliffe fan, and your brain was awash in chemical excitation at the prospect of seeing your guy, and you had been waiting for hours, and you knew he was going to come out of THAT DOOR THERE, and it was dark . . .\n\nAnd then a semi look-a-like u/TheGeorgianWelshman walks out . . .\n\nWell, you go NUTS.\n\nAnd they really did. \n\nI don't know how to put a number to the crowd. It felt like 1000 people but maybe it was only hundreds. \n\nThey filled up the entire sidewalk for most of the entire block, though. \n\nAnd when I stepped out of the theater in to the shadowy alleyway, with Richard right behind me (maybe making me persuasively a Radcliffe look-a-like?) all those people just absolutely ROARED for me.\n\nI didn't understand what was going on for a second, but then I did, and I was already drunk (big drinker back in the day), and I felt like having fun, so I raised both my hands over my head, Rocky-style, and I jumped and cheered and waved and just basically adored that crowd right back.\n\nI high-fived people.\n\nI hugged some. \n\nI cut a mad jig.\n\nAnd that crowd just LOVED it.\n\nThen, as I was nearing the car we had waiting for us, I heard someone go, \"Hey! THAT'S NOT DANIEL RADCLIFFE! THAT'S JUST SOME ASSHOLE!\"\n\nAnd then I had one of the scariest experiences of my life. \n\nThe crowd just booed and hissed and spat hatred at me. \n\nI mean:\n\nHATRED.\n\nThe cops held some people back.\n\nThe crowd surged. \n\nRichard tried to sneak past me to evade the worst of it. \n\nSome security guy grabbed my arm and yanked me towards the car, going, \"Into the car! Into the car!\"\n\nAnd I got into the car.\n\nAnd the driver blasted out of there like Jason Bourne.\n\nIt was a hell of a night.",

This also includes accounts that post explicit content anywhere else on Reddit.\n\n\nPlease do not SPAM the group with reposts. This means posting a new pic when you've recently posted, or deleting your old post and reposting a new pic a day or two later, especially if you've not interacted with guessers in the first post (aka you're farming karma). We do notice, and that will result in a temporary or permanent ban, depending on how grouchy your mod team is that day.\n\n\nPlease REPORT comments on your post that are creepy, insulting, harassing, comment on your appearance (positive or negative) or otherwise shitty. We do take them seriously and will ban people who behave like this, with no exceptions.\n\n\nWe will delete any posts where we suspect you are posting someone else's photo. You will be banned and asked to provide a verification picture to remove the ban. (Screenshots are a big red flag).\n\n\nDo not engage with trolls - two wrongs do not make a right. We do take action when comments/posts are reported... give us the time to review, we're not here 24/7.\n\n\nAny other questions? You can always send your mod team a mail message.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

This means posting a new pic when you've recently posted, or deleting your old post and reposting a new pic a day or two later, especially if you've not interacted with guessers in the first post (aka you're farming karma). We do notice, and that will result in a temporary or permanent ban, depending on how grouchy your mod team is that day.\n\n\nPlease REPORT comments on your post that are creepy, insulting, harassing, comment on your appearance (positive or negative) or otherwise shitty.

I truly dont understand why he is considered to have been the first celebrity president. Maybe he was more well known as an actor than as a governor prior to being elected president, but that doesnt change the fact that he did have some experience in the government prior to being president. Compare that to Lincoln, who was a nationally known figure due to the Lincoln-Douglas debates, and could rightfully have been considered a celebrity in those times, but his two years serving as a state representative before being president are enough for him not to be considered a \u201ccelebrity president\u201d?",

Lots of actors and musicians will start turning down interviews and skipping out on promo tours, hosting gigs or guest star type appearances once they reach a certain level of fame or success. \n\nRita attends every promo interview, will walk every red carpet, will be at every photo call, will take every well paid hosting gig she is offered and will absolutely accept that small acting role in a major film. I don\u2019t know her personally, but if I had to guess I would say she is a woman who knows how to work and maintain her level of press coverage. She avoids over exposure because she doesn\u2019t flood your social media feeds with every thought that pops into her head. But she knows where and when to appear - an interview with British Vogue here, a tv hosting gig there. This isn\u2019t all her doing - I dare say a fair chunk of it is down to her agent, management, PR person etc. But that woman works for her image, and that part of the celebrity machine certainly gets overlooked by the public.",

She was always kind to guys, and girls, - even when she became famous and I saw her on the street she would stop for a hug, and take time to chat.\nI think maybe because she came from a pretty humble beginnings she had to hustle, in whatever way needed to get ahead (no nepo connections here), - \nand yes i\u2019m not going to ignore the obvious celeb hook ups that probably helped her along the way, - but I also think being a genuinely nice person made people want to help her move forward, - \nespecially because she got locked in a pretty shitty deal with roc nation where she couldn\u2019t, and they wouldn\u2019t release any of her music as they thought her sound was too similar to Rihanna, - \nso she was basically just in limbo for years! \nI believe that\u2019s why in the beginning she had to use her connections to do random collabs where she was mostly featured on a track, rather than solo projects. Perhaps she\u2019s not a talented song writer, but she definitely has a savvy business mind to manage to stay sort of relevant and famous through all these years.. maybe some of the fame came from let\u2019s say less than traditional ways, - but honestly she isn\u2019t the first, or the last to do it that way.- and she has stayed true to her friends, and supported her family throughout it all.

                "That red dress had to be a well-calculated, well-executed, and well-hidden joke played on MM. My guess is there were no more than 5 conspirators in on the joke. I can think of no other explanation, and I have embarrassingly given this a lot of thought.",
                "Although there is much to dislike Wallis, but still she dressed much better than Madame.\nMadame doesn't have the charm of a Queen Mother or Wallis' sense of style.",
                "Ughh.  The Queen Mother looks like a vision of dignity and grace.  The ILBW is trashy and classless.\n\nETA:  I\u2019ll bet she thinks these red inverted nipple dress pictures are stunning.",
                "I love that she thinks she looks SO amazing.... \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23",

                "How did she fit that thing, look at herself in the mirror, and not said \"What the fuck is that?\"",
                "She pull it off the rack and when the staff about to advise a better option, she lash out. When the staff about to take it from her for fitting, she lash out. \n\nSo the staff pu their hands up in surrender.\n\nLater on: \n\"oh gosh anna why did you let her go out in that\" , \n\n\"I tried, she won't listen\". \n\n\"Guys, guys! is that price tag hanging at the back??\u201d \n\n\"OH MY GO-\u201d",
                "I don\u2019t understand why we still lump her with \u201ccelebrity\u201d. She was a D list actress living and working in Canada, not Hollywood. She was never a celebrity. Harry\u2019s RF rubbed off their celebrity on her for a while, but that washed away when they cut her off. She is a failed D list actress now, nearing 50 years of age, can not work because she is too Royal to slum it, FIL is not open to extortion, alimony or payout from divorce is still far off as she is still peddling the togetherness lies, her charities are failing so she can not pay herself from their coffers, the media contracts will sustain her now but are drying up, she has no major fashion house funding her, all famous friends who hung around her are gone. Why is she still pegged as a celebrity? I reserve that for the likes of hard working and successful celebrities like Jennifer Aniston or Beyonc\u00e9 or Jennifer Lopez .",
                "So I actually have a theory that it takes about 10 years for a royal wives to really adapt to royal family life. If you look back at the early years, the Queen Mother, Sophie Edinburgh, Princess Diana and the current Princess of Wales were all a bit more awkward at the start, and all took a few years to build up their workloads and take on causes that mattered to them. They all took a while to find their fashion footing (QEQM took longer than most, because she didn't have a thin, model-type body and needed to find what worked for her). For all of them this also coincided with them having finished having children and the children starting to grow up. The Queen Mother, like Princess Diana, had the natural advantages of coming from the upper classes, and having fantastic charisma and an ability to talk to anyone. But anyway, this is why Meghan's desire to rush into things, rather than sitting back, taking it slowly and learning the ropes, was a big mistake.",
                "To be fair, though, M will *never* be a Queen Mother, so there's no comparison - and that'd be Catherine's role if she's still alive when George becomes King.",
                "I\u2019m American, but the death of the late Queen really affected me on ways I didn\u2019t expect. As with most, she had been the anchor that was always the most dignified in any situation.\n\nHer passing made me even more curious than ever to understand King George VI. The way that he and QEII approached their duties to UK, and during a world war are not in most mindsets of today.  I can\u2019t imagine how scary being amongst the bombing and the number of lives taken during the War is even beyond my comprehension. I think with the Queen, she was the slow and steady hand because she literally had lived through it.\n\nSadly, most WWII survivors have passed away. I worry about that becoming most people now where not born (me included, LOL) haven\u2019t been able to have heard the atrocities or learn about reasons it happened. This is not to lay blame on any country, rather understanding the past so as to never have it happen again. May God bless us all.",
                "The portrait of the late Queen Mother is gorgeous!! I don't think I've ever seen this one before... stunning!",
                "this is what surprises me the most about meghan, she always manages to look bad with clothes this dress is a great example the fabric on camera shines in a way that looks cheap, it is wrinkled, the fabric does not have a great drape that can stylize it or help the fabric not wrinkle because the wrinkles at the height of her hips are because the dress was not ironed, the neckline is not flattering, the way the fabric in part of the breasts is made in a terrible way that makes it look bad, but the color of his shoes is fine so that everything is not critical",
                "I actually laughed at Megsy in this dress, as it was yet another bad look for her. At the time, I thought the dress was made for her.  Then I learned this was an off-the-rack dress, tailored to fit her. The problem was the bodice was altered to accommodate her short waist figure, and it distorted the entire bodice, causing the lumpy sides and inverted nipples.  Most tailors or dressmakers would tell a client if a dress wasn't the best choice for their figure type.  If they did that Megsy would have pitched a fit. \n\nThis is a zoomed photo of the dress as it appeared on the Neiman Marcus website.

                "This dress itself is so hideous and ill fitting and inapproproate for the ocassion that I had never before noticed all the other horrible aspects of this look. \n\n1. The shoes. Why are they a different shade of red? She should have either gone for the same shade of red, or something completelt contrasting. \n\n2. The snatched up bun. I know that's supposed to be a clean look, but it somehow makes her look more shabby and tacky.\n\n3. What's with the long tail of the eyeliner? It's not a cat eye, it's just a line drawn out too far. Side note, lining the lower water line is definitely not her look! \n\n4. The stacking bracelets again. There's a time and place for wearing jewelery in funky ways. (May I add, there is no right time or place to wear a love bracelet from your ex-husband while still married to your current husband, IMHO)",

                "Ah. The dented tit dress.  Never fails to crack me up.  \n\nGotta love how she thinks she's the height of sexy.\n\nShe walked like that at Hertz and the birthday outing. Swinging those shoulders with the idea of shaking her small boobs around so that everyone could look at them.  She was all turned on. And at Hertz, stupid H was walking behind her grinning.\n\nThe dress is an orange red, but the shoes are a blue red, almost purple. Too bad no one thought to tell her that the colors don't match.",
                "It should be noted that Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon came from a storied noble family and lived in a more formal time. Stately parties, good manners and dress were second nature to her circle.\n\nThat Woman comes from more humble origins. However, looking at similar examples of Catherine Middleton and Sophie Rhys-Jones, she would have gotten the best mentors and advisors to help her transition to royal life.

She was very domineering to the Queen, and Prince Phillip hated how she overly indulged Charles and wouldn't respect the parent's wishes on how he be raised. She gave off this image as a doddery cute old lady, but according to Lady C she was a bit of a handful and very controlling. But she was impeccable in public and always carried out her duties with dignity, especially during the War years",
                "She can not own a full-length mirror to see herself or she wouldn't walk out of the house. I honestly don't know how she could look at herself and think that she looks good. Her ego tells her she's the hottest thing there.",
                "I feel like the Queen Mother was the last British royal to really embrace all the jewels. She wore multiple necklaces at a time, plus crowns/tiaras, earrings, bracelets, rings\u2026 4 parures at once! I miss that level of glam. I know it\u2019d be criticized because of the state of the economy and all, but the royal jewels are already paid for - wear \u2018em!",

He had been serving the Queen Mum some sort of hot gravy or sauce and to his horror a drop of the hot liquid plopped right into her cleavage. He was absolutely mortified and immediately started apologizing profusely and not knowing what to do. He said he knew it was steaming and she had to have felt burned. But he said she didn\u2019t get mad or jump up or anything, she maintained composure and so generously told him no no it was MY fault. It was nobody\u2019s fault of course but he was so grateful that she was able to acknowledge the general awkwardness in a graceful and respectable way despite you know, the mortifying situation for everyone. I mean making someone feel at ease in that situation is just pure class.",

Like the late Queen\u2019s latter years  \u201cgo to\u201d outfit of a dress and coat in bright colours, with a large hat, her mothers \u201cgo to\u201d was a similar dress and coat in floral pastels in floaty fabric, with a flowery cloche type hat. Catherine (and to a lesser extent, Sophie) have the tailored coat dress as their go to, although Catherine rocks a natty suit too!\n\nBut - the big difference is - the Royal ladies have all their \u201cofficial\u201d outfits properly tailored to fit, accessorise them perfectly with gorgeous hats, bags and shoes, and on daytime engagements, discreet jewellery. And their hair always looks groomed too - even when worn loose!",
                "Seeing the shoes, I get even more of a \"prom\" vibe from this look.\n\nThe dress that doesn't *quite* fit right, the weird, overly tight updo, the overdone, badly blended makeup, the smug facial expressions like this is all about her, the tan lines/uneven spray tan, the shoes... ooh, boy, the shoes. Did she buy satin dyeable shoes to match the dress? (Anyone else remember those?) Someone should tell her, they don't match. You've got to check those details out in various lights to make sure they match, or go with a different but complementary color/pattern.",

I just happened to watch the movie on a whim about 6 years ago and it instantly hit a chord with me. Loved the two main characters and loved the stunning background designs. I started painting Trolls fan art- these hyper colored watercolors with a teensy Branch and Poppy hidden in each. They sold really well. I\u2019d always dabbled in watercolor but it never occurred to me that I could make money off my work.\n\nSix years later I\u2019m a full time artist. I absolutely love my job. I know it sounds cheesy but I really believe it\u2019s my calling.

Salt Fat Acid Heat transformed the way I build and balance flavors. Ingredient challenge shows like Chopped and recently Easy Bake Battle have made me be more inventive with mixing pantry items from different cuisines to make fun stuff on weeknights (last night I made spicy truffle quinoa with crispy Chinese sausage and smashed cucumbers and it was amazing). Curtis Stone has a series on the education streaming service Wondrium that\u2019s helped build our confidence in outdoor cooking. \nWhile I love Iron Chef because of the camp and inventiveness, we tend not to watch celebrity chef centric shows that glorify high pressure kitchens or cult of genius that contributes to abusive restaurant workplaces.

It completely opened my eyes about how toxic my attitude was at my first adult job and why I had to quit. \n\nHe was a caricature for new Gen Z graduates and our rocky transition from a competitive environment (college) into a teamwork one (career). We are perfectionists due to academic performance being our only measurement of success, so we take any criticism personally. In turn we come across as defensive and hard to work with, which only causes us to lash out more. It also shows the difficulty of learning office politics and white collar speak as well for many people. \n\nHe was definitely a hyperbole but it was really done well to show the struggles a lot of young adults face. It completely changed my perspective and helped my career development a lot. \n\nIt\u2019s kinda hilarious a cartoon about a death metal red panda did all this haha.

                "This one is a walk but Chris Hardwick. When he originally started his Nerdist podcast around 2010/2011, he talked candidly about his drunk years and his journey to get sober. I was a year out of college and drinking pretty heavily but didn't think it was an issue because I wasn't a raging asshole drunk like family members. \n\nI got his self-help book when it came out and realized his struggles with anxiety and his drinking to cope with the anxiety sounded a lot like how I felt. So after a particularly bad night of poor decision making while drunk, I made the decision to stop drinking and deal with my feelings/anxiety via therapy because of his book.\n\nI stopped following him around 2016 or so because my interests shifted (his podcast became less interesting once Jonah and Matt Mira dropped off and it sounded more like PR stops than conversations with friends) so when the news came out about how he mis-treated his former girlfriend, I lost a lot of respect for him but I still appreciate him for how he helped and positively influenced a younger version of myself.",

That is a bisexual pride movie and I loved it more and differently than before.\n\nBut my biggest one is Waterloo Sunset by the Kinks. It\u2019s a song about so many things, but a major theme is this idea that you can be lonely but you can feel ok too, you can look at a happy couple and you\u2019re not jealous. You can feel a happiness that is not perverse or parasocial, it\u2019s just seeing others happy and enjoying that. You don\u2019t have to feel afraid. It\u2019s the best song ever written, it just says so much. I was a lonesome teenager and young adult, I had a long distance girlfriend, like England to America, so I spent a lot of time alone.

I lost it at the scenes where she tells and old woman at the bus stop that she's beautiful and when she cries because she doesn't feel pretty anymore. I saw my own anxieties so much in hers' and to see her in the end choose a life of vulnerability and humanness over perfection has really helped me. I'm so thankful to Greta for making this movie.",

                "Hairspray (both movies) but particularly the character of Penny Pingleton. As a super shy, socially awkward girl with anxiety it was really nice to see a character like that represented on screen at a young age who wasn\u2019t a total joke (although she is a bit weird and funny at times but it\u2019s in an endearing way) or the stereotypical nerd (she is dorky but not like the stereotypical geek). I also came from a pretty sheltered upbringing so to see that character on screen and goes through that arc of growing confidence, standing up for what\u2019s right, and breaking away from her strict parents (and sexual liberation but 7 year old me didn\u2019t fully understand that) meant the world to me. I would often remember Penny\u2019s growth in the films in times when I was nervous or lacked confidence and it would help me overcome that because if she could do it so could I. The character (particularly Amanda Bynes\u2019 version) was the quirky funny weird girl as well and she taught me that it was ok to be like that and to just be me \ud83d\ude0a. Plus she was SUPER loyal even when she knew it would get her into trouble (particularly the OG. Idk where that actress is today but she needs to know that she is an icon \ud83e\udee1. Leslie Ann Powers honestly was so good in that movie and gets like no credit for it cause she essentially disappeared). It was like I either wanted to be a loyal friend like Penny or HAVE a loyal friend like Penny (as I was too shy to have a lot of friends, which that changed cause I got the confidence after Hairspray so slay).

                "Christina Aguilera. As a Latina who could never pass, we don't look alike, but growing up in the very white early 2000s, it was inspiring to know that she was out there, and I loved her voice. Stripped was a huge turning point for me---it holds up better than ever today. She's had some messy moments like anyone else, but I remember reading a story from her in the mid-2000s (2006ish?) about how Jessica Simpson sent her flowers with a special note saying what an inspiration she was to her, when they were apparently staying at the same hotel. Christina said hats off to Jessica for doing that, and \"It is a beautiful thing to be a woman in support of other women\". I was also touched by her comments when Lady Gaga took down her collaboration with R. Kelly from iTunes. I was recovering from sexual trauma at the time, and it meant a lot to hear Christina speak out in support for survivors.\n\nPeople have often criticized me as \"too much\". My outfits are too over-the-top, I am too \"emotional\", I can't let things go, I am tone-policed and told I get too loud when I get too excited. A lot of people say Christina is too much---an over-singer, too overtly sexual, a diva. I've always felt a kinship there, that she's not willing to compromise who she is for a record label, especially as she ages. For me as a young teen, she really drove home that you can be sexy on your own terms, but also still opinionated, emotionally strong, and pro-woman. I dressed as her last Halloween as a tribute.\n\nThe intro to the Stripped album is essentially a theme song to my life.",
                "Something that influenced me in a way I didn't get until later is Al Stewart's album Year of the Cat.

He played \"Broadway Hotel\" for me at the show that night.\n\nu/VaguelyArtistic mentioned Harold and Maude. I saw it when I was very young (10, maybe?), and it shaped a lot of my outlook on life.

I tried avoiding anything sexualized so thought just watching ABC Family shows like 7th heaven would help. Unfortunately there\u2019s just as much sexualization of women on shows like this. The topic of sex wasn\u2019t avoided, it was talked about a bunch, framed as something precious for you to give your husband- rather than something you should have control over and do for your own pleasure. It did not help me regain a sense of control over my body whatsoever, in fact it likely made it worse.\n\nThen came Pink with her Miss Understood album and videos.

Like they have fame and fortune but is truly soulless at the end of the day. Nobody should be whorshipped and no sport should be a religion. You can enjoy their music, enjoy their art, enjoy their movies, and enjoy watching them play. It shouldn\u2019t be beyond because chances your favorite isn\u2019t the sweet Angel you think they are. Which is okay tbh. I\u2019m not approving of OJ potentially killing his wife, bill Cosby drugging people to have sex, Lizzo abusing workers, or Rkelly sexual tapes with minors. I\u2019m not condoning or approving those things if they did those things they need to be dealt with. However i think people find it easier if they just criticize or enjoy their profession then worry about their personal life. \n\nKeep this in mind that these people have been doing these professions since they were little kids all they know is the entertainment field or the industry they grew up in. They were probably abused or seen alot of abuse coming in their fields which lead to them being abusive. It\u2019s a all lit shitshow just abunch of super talented super villains.",

A person who is abusive towards everyone (partner, children, co-workers, people they hired to take care of ) doesn't deserve anyone's support.  A good indicator of this would be a person fires people at the drop of a hat or people don't want to work with this person and this includes other celebs.

We may be getting close to a point where a celebrity couple can admit they're in an open relationship--but until now, its mainly been viewed as easier to just take the L and be called a cheater and apologize than to say \"My wife gave me permission to have sex with her and sometimes my wife has sex with her too.\" My point here is you really don't know what's going on inside their private lives, even if they are interviewed about it.",

It is then we'll probably see more pictures of them as a family in the UK, making use of the grand security detail as they go about their business in the UK, with noted pixilated pictures of their kids to make a fingered jabbing point of protecting THEIR children's privacy as opposed to William and Catherine. And winning their lawsuit against MGN will be used to cite a clapback response to anything negative said about them in the media, saying that \"everyone, regardless of status, have a right to privacy ... blah, blah blah\" and will be seen as a case of \"you can't believe what the media says as the UK judgement on three cases brought against them... blah, blah, blah\", and of course, I suspect, those pro-Sussex media outlets will be getting high on the sugar rush as a result.\n\nThere is still plenty of road ahead, my fellow sinners.

                "I agree overall.  If they're an actor it's one thing but hamfisted ones (like Abrams) are cringey and just date the material.",
                "Doing it to bring in a friend is ok if it's just as a background character with few or no lines. Doing it for fun is fine. Doing it because it makes sense is better. Doing it just to shoehorn in someone for the views is terrible.",

                "There's really no place in Star Wars for this stuff.  It was bad with Bea Arthur in the holiday special and it's bad now.  It's one thing to have a great actor deliver a great performance for a well-written character; I wouldn't consider Andy Serkis a celebrity cameo in Andor, for instance.  Take the actor and the role seriously, even if it's humorous, and make sure there's a purpose to it.  This isn't Friends, where you get an applause beat when you walk in the door.  This is myth and deserves to be treated as such, and there's zero excuse for getting marginally talented people on-screen roles in Star Wars (which, I'm sorry, that's what Jack Black and Lizzo are).",
                "There's two ways to do cameos:\n\nThe Bill Burr way where you introduce an interesting character with a unique story and just have a talented actor/celebrity play the part.\n\nThe Lizzo way where it's just a *\"yaasss Queen\"* moment meant to generate social media posts of *\"OMG DID YOU SEE LIZZO IN STAR WARS??!\"* rather than contribute **anything meaningful** to the story.\n\nJack Black was just disappointing because he should've been given the Bill Burr treatment considering his love for Star Wars.",
                "Generally I don't think that anyone in Star Wars should bring their existing celebrity with them, except for the classic Alec Guinness 'elder character played by decorated actor' thing. Not even limiting that to cameos. I don't mean that everyone should be literally unknown, but that personalities should be less important than simply becoming the role.\n\nI do think that it would be fun to have musicians show up *as musicians* (in costume/makeup), but as I understanding it Lizzo isn't doing that?\n\nJack Black and Lizzo seem like really fun people to be there, don't get me wrong, but it works against immersion.",

He should have been given a main role in Season 3 yet for some reason he didn't appear at all. In fact, fuck Mandalorian, Mayfeld should get his own grittier show written by Tony Gilroy.",
                "In general I think if you want your show to be taken seriously you should hire actors to act. Non actor cameos are garbage in all forms if you expect a show to be taken seriously.\n\nThis speaks to the poor quality of Mando season 3 though.  Very little of that was written as a serious show.  The whole thing was a live action cartoon and not a good one either.",
                "It\u2019s obvious that Disney has become desperate to get people watching their garbage, and one way to do that is to hire singers and comedians for cameo roles that stick out horribly and never feel like part of the actual universe. Lizzo looks ridiculous standing there in that outfit, and so does Jack Black. It\u2019s just gross and pathetic.",

                "Mick Fleetwood and Iggy Pop made cameo appearances in episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation and Deep Space Nine, respectively, but then again, they played aliens under lots of makeup and masks, so it wasn't distracting.",
                "Tbh I didn\u2019t care for that episode as a whole. Just a space filler",
                "Yeah I hate celebrity cameos too, save them for the sitcoms lol",
                "The part that always feels so weird to me is how the camera always lingers on the celebrity making a cameo. You know, like they are saying \u201csee look! We got ed Sheeran in game of thrones!\u201d Like it\u2019s a reveal that they are there. \n\nI think a good example to show what I mean is in Star Trek Into Darkness, when Benedict Cumberbatch says the Khan thing. We as the audience know who Khan is but for the characters, it shouldn\u2019t mean anything. \n\nWhile Mr. Cumberbatch wasn\u2019t a celebrity cameo, it still highlights how the creators are expecting us to react to something we have knowledge about that doesn\u2019t work in the story\u2026like having Jack Black in Star Wars. The camera lingers for a second longer than it would if that character wasn\u2019t a celebrity cameo. They want us to emote when we see the funny guy we like from Tropic Thunder.",
                "I don\u2019t mind it for characters that aren\u2019t really supposed to be taken seriously. Captain Bombardier and The Duchess would have been just as silly with or without Jack Black and Lizzo. I actually found it worse when Flea was one of the people chasing Leia through the forest in Kenobi. It added nothing to the scenes he was in and was just distracting.",
                "It gave me serious CW/Sci-fi channel vibes. Like how all the actors from Spartacus finds themselves in the Arrowverse. Only Disney can afford \u201cbigger names\u201d \nI think as an audience member nothing takes me out of a story more than seeing a celebrity rather than a character performed by an actor if that makes sense. I don\u2019t see the governor of the moon thing, I see Jack Black. I don\u2019t see what\u2019s her face wife, I see Lizzo. I\u2019d expect to see them in a \u201csci-fi movie\u201d parody of this scene. Not in the actual show.\n\nJack Black is cool. But I\u2019d rather see him voice an alien or somewhere I don\u2019t immediately think \u201cThat\u2019s Jack Black\u201d. I so I suppose I have the direct opposite reaction to what Disney presumably wanted."

                "I took it as be careful who you\u2019re friend with and everyone is not your friend and thats exactly what is should be like. It\u2019s fine to have one or two friends but you don\u2019t need to be friends with everyone because everyone does not have your best interest at heart. \n\nThis is the same advice parents give to their kids and it\u2019s no different at work.",
                "people were saying he's being shady but i think baekhyun gave her a very sound advice, he is just saying to choose your circle carefully : as much as possible make it small and surround yourself with trustworthy individuals. considering she's so young in such a demanding industry it's very important for her to keep herself grounded.",
                "He just means it\u2019s important to not have a lot of celebrity friends to help you stay grounded and to not lose yourself in the industry. He mentioned before that having only his childhood friends and very few celebs in his circle helped him stay sane and humble because of how chaotic the kpop industry is. Also if an idol is close to a lot of celebrities it\u2019s easy for them to be entangled in their business and whenever a scandal breaks out people will try to tie them together and say \u201coh they\u2019re friends with all these celebrities they must be birds of a feather\u201d",
                "I think Baekhyun offered good advice that Eunchae will be able to carry with her for the rest of her career, he\u2019s been an idol for years and clearly has seen/heard things behind the scenes, the idol industry is really competitive so who knows how people really are so it\u2019s best to be on guard",
                "I think at Eunchae's age (teens), it's normal to want to fit in and make lots and lots of friends. As you move into the 20s you slowly realise that many \"friends\" aren't worth keeping at all, and I think Baekhyun (and the other two as well) meant that she should be more selective with who she befriends. The more selective she is, the less likely she is to get into trouble or get hurt by them.",
                "The entertainment industry is full of snakes and backstabbers; he was just trying to give someone young advice not to trust every famous person you meet. Not everyone is going to be genuine and the higher up you are on the fame ladder, the more likelihood you\u2019ll run into people who don\u2019t have your best interests at heart.",
                "I feel like sometimes even people saying \"idols are people just like us\" don't fully get what that means. It means they have many many negative traits that unfortunately get amplified when you're rich and famous. And especially if you're surrounded by other rich and famous people who think alike and enable each other, I think it'll be easy to lose touch with reality and get with a bad crowd, that's why he gave her that advice.",
                "yes, its nice to believe that the kpop industry is full of nice and wholesome people, but she\u2019s a young girl who skyrocketed into fame. she needs to be wary. she has her members to support her, and she has a few friends like kyujin. i think he was looking out for her as someone who knows the industry really well",
                "Choose your friends wisely is the best advice anyone could give, especially to a very young and impressionable celebrity surrounded by older, more experienced celebrities. You gotta be careful and protect yourself.",
                "People are thinking too deeply about this lol\n\nHe didnt say dont make friends. His advice is to choose wisely who you let get close to you because yes, not everyone has your best interest in mind. \n\nBaekhyun has 11 years of experience and he is friendly with everyone but pretty much stays at home or only hangs out with exo members or his childhood friends. We have seen many times how people judge who they are friends with as well. Its pretty solid advice that anyone can use tbh",
                "Kpop industry isn't the cute bubbly world the industry is selling us, it's filled with bad people. Telling a 16 yo to be careful is the wisest thing a senior can say. He was actually pretty brave to say it because some misunderstood his words.\nIn general, this goes for normal people too. I'm sure you don't  like all the people who work with you or all your classmates. I'm sure we're all surrounded by negative people and we know that we have to keep them away. If this happens in our own boring little world, imagine in a highly competitive industry filled with famous young people, not counting all the other workers that are behind the scenes.",
                "I\u2019m sure he meant 1) be careful who you make friends with 2) it\u2019s probably not good emotionally/career wise to only be friends with people who are on the same boat as you. \n\nPeople in the art field should make a variety of friends and network. I hate networking but I think it\u2019s probably important as well for celebrities.",
                "I think Baekhyun and EXO in general are very smart and know who to keep close and who to stay away from. Knowing she\u2019s so young and is currently in the spotlight being approached by so many idols and others wanted to take advantage of her popularity and I think he wanted to give her good advice.",
                "none of us are celebrities too and especially not in an industry that we\u2019re barely privy to. i find it very silly that people have issues with this statement when baekhyun is a top-level industry senior and has seen so much more than we could ever fathom. who are any of us to say that he\u2019s wrong for this? that level of fame is incomprehensible to the regular civilian. celebrities take years and years of their career of achieving a healthy balance and i\u2019m more willing to take advice from him than someone who\u2019s merely shown the industry through a filtered lens\n\nedit: baekhyun is also very well known within the fandom to still be best friends with his childhood hometown friends. that\u2019s his main friend group outside of exo. i think it really has kept his grounded and not surrounded by a bunch of yes men",
                "The industry is shady af. All around the world. Not just in korea. It is known that senior male artists (idols, actor, etc) often prey on young newly debut female artists. I cant remember who said this but the word is like 'those senior wont leave you alone when you a rookie'. I just want to mention this coz i find this cute lol but sakura always told other celebrities on any show she went to contact her through her manager. She might be joking but i dont think so. Good for her. Know how to take care of herself. \n\nIm sorry i cant remember who said this too. She said 'rumor spread super fast in the industry'. Keep your circle small. Image even among the peoples in the industry is important. Sure it might dont go outside the industry, but the industry knows.",
                "He's not saying it's a problem to befriend other kpop idols. He just says don't make a lot of celebrity friends. It sounds to me he's saying to have friends outside of celebrity circle, which imo is a sound advice since celebrities are in a world that's so vastly different than reality that when they no longer become celebrity it is difficult to adapt. Eunchae is also super young so she may have a harder time than other idols who have went to university for example.",
                "if someone who is my senior for 10 years says to be careful with people in the industry, i will definitely take note on that. people won\u2019t say that unless they really went traumatic events related to that thing lol",
                "Considering how many idols get caught being terrible people, I would consider it a sound advice. Plus, she's a girl, she has to navigate around many things Baekhyun does not.",
                "As a Baekhyun fan, I think he means that you need friends outside the industry. I think being a celebrity, especially an idol can have a negative effect on your ego. Also, celebrities are so focused on their image and status that I think it can make them out of touch with reality. Having a lot of friends who are regular people can help keep you grounded. \n\nBaekhyun is still very close to his high school friends, none of whom are in the entertainment industry. I think having friends who are not celebrities helps keep him grounded in reality and helps him to see his fans as the support they are and his idol work as a job. Baekhyun is incredibly talented and very famous but he's also very humble and works really hard to stay connected to fans. I think being down to earth is a part of this.",
                "It has the same vibes of Hyolin saying that juniors should be careful to their male seniors. I trust them since they are an idol and they know the behind the scenes",
                "Seems like good advice. \n\nCelebrity friends will most likely lead to a celebrity lifestyle and it's tougher to stay grounded. You might also start developing a sense of superiority towards \"normal\" people. \n\nAll entertainment industries are also very fickle in regard to successful entertainers, so you never know who would use you for their own gains and who actually cares about the person.\n\nHaving childhood friends (or civilians), especially from a younger age, is definitely worth much more as they keep you grounded, know you before the success and also keep you connected to the life of most people.",
                "I think besides the \"entertainment industry is competitive and full of snakes and backstabbers\", its really vital to have strong friendships with people outside of the industry. Keeps you grounded and sane.   \n\n\nI know a lot of kpop fans are too young/students and might not be working but imagine you work at a restaurant and your **only** friends are other people who work at that restaurant. Who do you hang out with on your day off when everyone else is working? Its nice and important to have friends who can understand what its like to be stressed out about specific restaurant work situations, but when you've been pulling 10 hour shifts 6 days a week and you cant stand to even think about a kitchen anymore, who do you go to? If you get into an argument or fight with a coworker, who can you go to for  an objective opinion? What about when a coworker you go to the bar with after closing gets promoted and now theyre your superior - that can lead to power imbalances that can show up in the friendship weather the two of you intend it or not.   \nYou NEED friends outside of your workplace and outside of your industry.",
                "Tbh I think it\u2019s great advice. Idk why you thought he meant EXO case in specific. Whether you\u2019re a man or women celebs try to take advantage of you. Esp when you\u2019re young and meet older idols. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any difference in what Baekhyun and sistar are saying. They\u2019re coming from the same place of exercising caution.",
                "Didn't know there was this much room for interpretation.\n\nAs a Korean watching, it was just \"if you are closer with your members than you are with people outside your group, the group will naturally stay together longer.\"\n\nThis becomes even more clear if you actually watch the video and you hear Chanyeol say, just before that, \"playing more with your team members both inside and outside work, rather than with other people, is important \\[for group longevity\\].\"",
                "it's a good advice. in the industry you can't trust everyone you meet, some are there to make friend some are there to gain fame. so, if all your circle is ppl from the industry then at some point you might not know who to trust.",
                "I think it's sound advice, especially coming from someone's whose her senior and as a young girl, we see how people behave towards them, but I also think it's okay to have friends HER AGE who are celebrities because at the end of the day, they're people too and most of the times, these celebrities are the only ones who understand each other and can help guide one another in certain situations.",
                "The entertaiment industry is SHADY, every guy you befriend/become romanticaly involved with could be part of the next groupchat/burning sun scandal.",
                "I think he meant to be selective and don\u2019t just befriend anyone because you have the same job, or stick exclusively to having idol friends. It applies equally to real life too - I couldn\u2019t imagine just having work friends and no one else, you need a variety of people who can offer different support, advice and keep you grounded. A small circle of really good, close friends is far better than a big circle of people you barely know and are not sure you could trust if you needed to turn to someone. If you can nurture yourself a good, close group of friends it\u2019s all you need. \n\nI also didn\u2019t detect shade in Baekhyun\u2019s words, he\u2019s highly respected and admired by a lot of his peers, but that\u2019s not to say he\u2019s not talking from personal experience or from seeing others getting burned. We\u2019ve all experienced friendship breakups at some point in our lives and it\u2019s an added stress an idol doesn\u2019t need - especially when their every move and interaction already gets hyper-analysed. The more you keep your relationships low-key the more you can live peacefully and ensure those friendships are solid and long-lasting.",
                "its great advice in my opinion! not everyone is how they act infront of the cameras & an idol could end up guilty by association. Chanyeol & Sehun for example are probably the most social amongst EXO in terms of \u201ccelebrity friends\u201d. They got dragged in to the burning sun scandal just because they were friends/acquaintances with some of the guys involved. Similarly Kai is known to be very close with Ravi, when Ravi had his enlistment scandal, naturally antis used that as an opportunity to accuse Kai of being on the list of celebrities who paid to evade enlistment. Baekhyun chooses to stick to the friends he had pre-debut, which keeps him grounded & out of rumor-mill for the most part. Not everyone has the best of intentions, especially when an idol is as young as Eunchae is \u2026..",
                "If Baekhyun said so then he must have said it for a reason.",
                "I think a lot of idols would agree with this advice, especially those at the very top. it\u2019s difficult knowing who to trust in an environment and industry that is so competitive",
                "I think it\u2019s a good advice to consider especially that she\u2019s a young girl who are in one of the shadiest industry( entertainment overall ), which is full of shady people and a lot of bad things happens\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",
                "This needs way more context but look at how celebs have been dragged into their close celebrity friends\u2019 scandals, whether they are directly involved or not. Also, it is good to have grounded people around you. Not that celebs can\u2019t be grounded but I think having \u201cnormals\u201d as close friends may help with that.\n\nBut without more context from the clip, it hard to tell.",
                "That was very solid and useful advice by a senior. I feel it applies to all public figures regardless whether they work in the entertainment industry or not. As many know, the idols are all so young and its important that they have the awareness to choose their friends wisely. (he didn't say it explicitly but hinted at it indirectly)",
                "Its a good advice coming from a senior. People always says that you dont need a lot of friends, just the right ones. Especially in entertaiment business, these people thriving with their public image and attention from others so its a toxic environment\n\n- bunch of celebrities with fame and money being in their own little circle can really make these people lose touch to reality\n- entertainment world is not just full of rainbow, there are bunch of snakes and shady people trying to befriend each other either for their own personal sake or some can go as far as to ruin you\n- all these idols are directly/indirectly competing with each other, its ok to just treat each other like co workers and there is no need to treat them like they are your close friend or even as brother/sister",
                "\u0399 think it's a very good advice to give especially to a little girl because i'm sure there are many predators in the industry. Also, there's probably a lot of jealousy going on behind the scenes and people trying to backstab the each other. Last but not least, i think it's good for someone who is a celebrity to have people around them who live normal lives. It helps to keep them grounded.",
                "Ig he just meant that its ohk to relay and be connected to your members the most for a healthy long lasting group, its not important to be friends with everyone ,one can be happy with limited people also .",
                "He said it after emphasizing the importance to stay close to and spend time with her own members.  I think he meant if she has a ton of celebrity friends, maintaining those friendships will inevitably reduce the time she spends with her members so just don't have a lot of them and that won't be an issue.",
                "I think the standalone quote is being taken a little out of context and we are reading deeper into it than it is. The overall conversation was about \"how has EXO achieved such great longevity\" and they were talking about how they don't have friends outside of the group, and that's how they stayed together so long... the joke being because they have no other options, lol. They also said \"hang out more with your group members than your friends from before (fame)\" and the follow-on was \"and don't make too many celebrity friends either\". Just, have no friends outside of members so you'll definitely have to stay together, haha.\n\nDisclaimer, I don't speak Korean either, but this was just my read of the subs.",
                "I think it\u2019s akin to advice Sistar gave their juniors: stay as a hermit and steer clear of men. Basically, she should look out for shady ass people (because as much as we love our male idols, they are in fact, men) who mighty try to take advantage of her, especially bc she\u2019s young, and keep close to her group for her safety.",
                "it means there are a lot of fucking piranha in the entertainment industry so be careful, you dont really see it in kpop because they try to keep everything squicky clean but i am sure that industry is as messy as the Hollywood one.",
                "I think it's a wise personal decision, based on the notion that real people, real friends might keep you more grounded and humble, I think it's a good advice",
                "I think it\u2019s to keep her grounded and not let her head blow up like a balloon. And to avoid the thought that she\u2019s above the law because she has/or will have fame and money (e.g. Burning Sun)\n\nRmb being idol is a job for them.  Just like a regular job like office or cashier, it\u2019s good to have friends/acquaintances at work to vent and have a good time while at work but may be different outside of work. \n\nEunchae and Baekhyun are 14 years apart in age and Baekhyun has a decade idol experience. I think he\u2019s genuinely just tryna give her advice as he\u2019s lived l most of her life in idol years.",
                "I think BTS Suga's song \"Snooze\" perfectly outlines that whilst you may have celebrity friends as an idol, be wary and careful because these \"friends\" might outcast you later on if it suits them.",
                "He definitely meant about choosing your friends more wisely instead of just befriending someone who is a celebrity. And that is a really good advice as a senior.",
                "To a 16 year old? That's an excellent advice.",
                "He was just advising her to choose her friends wisely. At her age people want to gel with everyone and have a huge friend circle . People are blowing this out of proportion",
                "Ngl I was pretty irritated that people were calling the advice shady or even implying he was dragging certain members. It\u2019s sound advice and it\u2019s not like he himself doesn\u2019t have any celebrity friends at all.",
                "I think it\u2019s sound advice. \n\nShe\u2019s a very popular person right now and I don\u2019t doubt she\u2019ll get more popular as the years go by. \n\nAlso have to consider that she comes from a very popular company too, and people could use her or the proximity to her in order to gain access.\n\nIf people who have been in the industry for years spanning across multiple decades are all saying the same advice, they know what they\u2019re talking about",
                "Friends of celebs who turn out to be bad has that shadow behind them. Like 'was x in on y's doing/is x as bad as y too cos they know each other'. Also god forbid if they date another celebrity and gets exposed.",
                "Is everyone forgetting that she's 16?\nAn outgoing curious girl thrown into the industry, even got her own show where she gets to interview much older idols. They are right to tell her to be careful about befriending just anyone, just because they may have the same job. She is a child.",
                "The conversation was in the context of \"be really close friends with your members\", so I doubt what he meant was in the same line as the Sistar advice (though it's a good advice).  Perhaps he meant focus more on your own members rather than make friends with other groups at the expense of your relationship with your own members?",
                "I mean, it's just basic work advice lol. I'd say the same working in a company/business.",
                "I mean you should never ever befriend every person you work with and should always have friends outside of work. I work in a competitive industry- same here. You can get backstabbed very easily. That doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s saying \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t make celebrity friends\u201d but realistically it\u2019s not wise or healthy to only have friends you are also coworkers with. Because then you\u2019re always surrounded by work, and again, you don\u2019t really know if they\u2019re actually your friends or if they\u2019re going to use/backstab you later. Sad but a reality, especially if you work in a competitive market or if you\u2019re famous.",
                "I agree with his advice. Some people are not who we think they are. And it's better to beware of them.",
                "As others have said it seems like good advice coming from someone who has been in the industry for a long time. It is a competitive industry where people may try to use and take advantage of you. We don\u2019t know these idols and how they are in private and it would be unfortunate to get stabbed in the back or to get caught up with a scandal just for being close friends with someone as we have seen in the past.",
                "ppl that \u201cdon\u2019t understand\u201d/twisted his words are clearly antis and lack comprehension skills with absolutely no working brain cells \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44",
                "I took it as him warning her that she should be careful with who she's close with. Other celebrity friends, they are always going to be your competition. No matter what, it's not going to be your company who disciplines them and they may always have some option to backstab you. Whereas, your members have mostly no reason to do that because you guys are under the same group reputation, unless they do so out of jealousy or hatred (even so, they'll be in shit with your company management most likely).\n\nAlso, being friends, he meant by people you truly keep close. There is a limited number for that given your time and energy of how many you can invest in to keep that friendship. \n\n*So, in my opinion, I saw this advice as be friendly with everyone but not friends.*",
                "My friend used to work in entertainment industry (I'm talking about actors/singers/models, not behind the scene jobs). And it IS a mess (from perspective of someone with a 9-to-5 job like me). Ofc there are ALL kinds of people, but still, it's wild. I don't think it's any different in Kpop. I get his advice.",
                "Full of snakes and full of rapists.\n\nStay vigilant Eunchae.",
                "I mean it\u2019s whole industry, not everyone will have your best interest, honestly I think it\u2019s good advice.",
                "It's a good general advice to give someone in the entertainment industry. You should have friends that are not in that industry.",
                "I think it can be read as simply as: don\u2019t live in the celebrity bubble. You can still have friends (ie have a life/relationships) outside the industry.",
                "He said this after learning Eunchae's age. I feel like it's more of a protective older brother advice, we don't know what goes on in the industry & who's genuine & who's not.",
                "It's a great advice. A specific fandom just misinterpreted it because of their hate with exo. If a senior of mine told me that I would def take note. Besides, with many issues of various celebs I would probably limit who I get close to.",
                "Not watching the video yet, but I think what he means is to have diversity in your social circle?",
                "The entertainment industry is competitive and full of idol-personas, and money and fame can make people feel entitled, untouchable, controlling etc.\n\nIt's so easy for many to abuse their power, especially in a culture with social hierarchy, misogyny, easy scandals, korea's defamation laws.\n\nI would be extra careful too, especially as a young girl and woman.",
                "stuff like this makes me think i wouldn't last a day being an idol. imagine everything you say being dissected and twisted into something else entirely.",
                "She should def meet Taeyeon.\nGirl had been harrased by celeb sunbae in the past.",
                "i mean with the burning suns scandal and bullying expose cases, i say it is really good advice. i remember being so disappointed with a lot of my biases, cannot imagine how their actual friends/colleagues in the industry feel",
                "Honestly that\u2019s great advice, especially with eunchae being such a young public figure. There are def some crazy people out there waiting to take advantage of younger artists (in the industry or outside of it), def should stay clear of shady people and be aware of who you befriend. To many controversies happen because one person does something stupid or illegal and it falls onto their friends/colleagues and their respective groups. \ud83d\ude2d",
                "Yeah I am missing context here, this can be interpreted in a number of ways.",
                "His advice comes from a good place, but it's kind of interesting just because Eunchae is super social with other idols",
                "This is interesting because when BTS said they don\u2019t have many celebrity friends people called them arrogant and that it was essentially their own fault. \ud83e\udee3",
                "Meanwhile Eunchae inviting every 4th gen idol onto her YouTube series",
                "[removed]",
                "He's a big senior and that is very sound advice. You shouldn't limit yourself to only celebs, you gotta be grounded otherwise you'll forget how real normal life works lol. Also, since kpop is kinda a small circle in itself it is very easy to stay stuck in a bubble; and if things go sour with a person(?) you were friends with, oh my it could get very awkward real quick. Because at the end of the day, its still a job and making friends with everyone at your workplace might not end well.",
                "tbh the exos are mostly introverts, so they tend not to interact with others much besides the members and close childhood friends. They do have some celebrity friends like actors, mostly ngl, but other than that, they tend to stick together, which is cute but also sad that they can't trust that many people in the industry."

I recently saw a thread about the friendship between James Dean and Eartha Kitt, which I loved and I would LOVE to see more Old Hollywood tea.\n\nMy current endeavor involves seeking out the absolute finest and credible vintage celebrity tea via  articles, gossip forums, archived magazines/newspapers, social media accounts, et cetera, that offer insight into them and their lives.\n\nBonus points if it is well-written or presented and possesses the power to transport us to eras long gone. I love how  you gain insight into the lives of the cherished classic icons we hold close to our hearts  (even those who may have stirred a bit of controversy in their time.)\n\nSo  I pose a question: where do you turn to for these time capsules that reveal more about  the work and lives of revered legends such as James Dean, Marilyn Monroe, Elizabeth Taylor, Eartha Kitt, and those who have left a lasting imprint amidst the storm of controversy.",

But even with a former royal among its ranks, the startup has struggled to maintain its footing. Last year, its vast roster of contractor coaches staged a revolt after the company modified their pay; the relationship remains fraught, several coaches told The Daily Beast.\n\nAnd this week, BetterUp laid off 16 percent of its staff, the culmination of what multiple workers described as months of turbulence, filled with outbursts from executives, mysterious staff departures, and declining morale.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all there because of the same bullshit story they keep telling us: \u2018We\u2019re mission driven, and the mission is going to change the world,\u2019\u201d a recent employee said. But inside the business, he added, \u201cthey treat us like shit.\u201d\n\nAmid the tumult, Prince Harry has become an easy target for aggrieved staffers as well. One former employee, mirroring statements by several peers, assessed the Duke\u2019s day-to-day responsibilities: \u201cI\u2019m going to go with zero things.\u201d Other staffers were more charitable, suggesting that he has helped the company increase its reach in Europe and has lended his celebrity to help close major deals.\n\nIndisputably, though, Prince Harry has become a fixture of tabloids on both sides of the Atlantic, creating the risk that BetterUp\u2019s reputation will be linked with the drama. \u201cAt first I was like, \u2018This is cool,\u2019\u201d a recent staffer said of the Duke\u2019s corporate position, but increasingly \u201cit\u2019s been more of a distraction.\"\n\n\u201cEvery article mentions his role at BetterUp, then goes on to roast [him and Meghan Markle].\u201d At some point, the employee argued, \u201cthe juice isn\u2019t worth the squeeze.\u201d",

My parents and I have a strained relationship as it is. Especially considering my sister (22 f) and I were at their house 3 days ago and my sister threatened to kick my stomach in an attempt to injure my baby and they didn\u2019t do ANYTHING about it. This is just one example of my parents being awful at actually raising their children and creating a safe environment in their home. I had planned to stay with my parents right after giving birth to get assistance from my mother (59 f) but have recently SERIOUSLY questioned that decision as I just don\u2019t know that we would be safe there if my sister and her dog (that has bitten me before) are there. I\u2019ve informed my mother that I am unsure of this decision under the recent circumstances and she has done nothing but thrown attitude and imply that I\u2019m overreacting because \u201cmy sister is her child too so I must understand that they won\u2019t kick her out.\u201d After this recent event I have limited/cut contact with my parents out of frustration and fear of my child\u2019s safety but tonight my mother texted me a picture and showed a party that her friends threw for her and my father (59 m) for becoming grandparents including gifts for them and nothing for my baby. AND I WASN\u2019T EVEN INVITED!

My husband (26 m) and I are now considering staying with my in laws immediately after birth because at least we know our son will be safe and cared for there even though it will absolutely piss off my mother. My mother in law is also the one who threw me a baby shower and has taken more care of me throughout my pregnancy. I guess I\u2019m wondering what does Reddit think I should do in this situation regarding my parents and where they think I should stay upon leaving the hospital where we can get some help as first time parents?

I know it's a difficult thing to do because a) the Devil works hard but nepo baby PR works harder, b) for all we complain about nepo babies ruining Bollywood, audiences still eat them up, and c) there's honestly probably not a lot of money in it atm.  \n\n2) What do celebs think of desi creators on insta or tiktok blowing up because of their skits? A lot of them are amazing actors \u2013 are they ever afraid that, with the rise of these platforms that allow for people to enter the industry \"non-conventionally\", they'll be pushed to the side in favour of genuine talent? They can't exactly control influencer spheres the way they do traditional Bollywood.  \n\n3) This one is more lighthearted, but do you have any tips for selfies or body shots using your own phone?

I think she plays very gamineish roles but in person she reads closer to Mae West and Ava Gardner. \n\nAlso I think Viola Davis is a DC. Sue me.",

I fully believe Natalie Portman is SC. She may be petite in the literal sense but I just can't see any G energy in her. Her role in the Star Wars prequels would be completely different if played by someone like Audrey Tautou. I think Graceful Lady fits better.

It did not disappoint. \n\nThere was one review by a guy named Maynard. He seemed to think it was cool enough, but he took away 2 stars bc he thought they would have artifacts from the real ark and they didn\u2019t. \n\nI think about Maynard from time to time. \n\nI mean, if there were real, physical archeological evidence of the ark, I feel like that would be pretty big news.

                "I have a crazy story about the stupidity of visitors to this place. \n\nSooo, nine years ago, my husband and I took a transcontinental road trip for our honeymoon. We\u2019re not from the States, so this was a Big Deal. I told my husband we had to go to the Creation Museum - they hadn\u2019t finished the Ark yet, even though it meant taking a three day detour. \n\nFor context, I have an MA in Comparative Religion, and my husband has a PhD in Evolutionary Genetics. If we\u2019d had the balls, we could have live-streamed our visit, even though we were very careful to respect their rules and not discuss evolution. (It says on the door that if you do so, you will be forcibly removed by their armed and crazy-looking security people; not sure if that has changed since.)\n\nWe stayed for hours, and my brain turned more to mush with every passing minute. At one point, just after I had read the insane explanation of how the animals on the Ark were fed, I found myself standing in front of one of the dioramas that so impressed Morgan. This one showed a flooded expanse and the Ark in the distance. \n\nA lady came and stood next to me, and I honestly don\u2019t know what possessed me, but I just randomly said, \u201cthe unicorn missed the Ark, you know\u201d. She was really friendly and got so excited. She tells, that I need to tell her children all about this. Seconds later, I\u2019m surrounded by half a dozen kids of varying heights, staring at me as if I know the answer to life, the universe and everything. Internally kicking myself, I mumble \u201c the unicorn missed the Ark because it wanted to play in the rain\u201d - thanks Irish Rovers, you\u2019re partly to blame for giving me ideas - and make my escape. \n\nLong story short, I am going to Hell, because let\u2019s face it, these kids are raised to believe everything they are told, and they WILL go through life sharing this tidbit of information with other people who are similarly gullible.\n\nTL;DR: I made a joke about the unicorn missing the Ark, and I\u2019m pretty sure that this is still being shared as fact, because fundies really are that gullible. Pray for my soul, for I knew not what I was doing.",
                "So here\u2019s the difference.  There is a bunch of stuff at Disney that is educational and can be verified as fact.  I\u2019m Catholic, but we admit that lots of the Old Testament is allegory, and is not a history book.  Like were there guys named Abraham, Moses, Jacob, David, Joseph (OT Joseph, not St Joseph) etc, who did sometimes great and sometimes interesting things?  Probably.  Did some guy named Noah build an actual ark that held exactly 2 of every species living at that time?  It\u2019s just illogical.  Some of those animals only natural food are each other.  Plus, even if all of that were possible, there\u2019d be too little genetic variance for the species to survive.  There is some scientifically valid evidence out there was a major flood that could have caused major flooding across \u201cthe world\u201d as inhabitants of the Middle East thousands of years ago would have perceived it, and it\u2019s present in a lot of the \u201cmyths told as histories\u201d written around that period, but it\u2019s mostly allegory and fable.\n\n***Edited to correct Autocorrect error.***",

Uriel Septim didn't look like Patrick Stewart, Martin Septim didn't look like Sean Bean, Mr. House didn't look like Rene Auberjonois...\n\nI think that using the actor looks in the game, leads to focusing too much on it. Basically virtually screaming \"Look who we got on our payroll\". Which basically is where Cyberpunk's story suffered. They had to shove in Keanu, scrap the whole first act and then have the whole story revolving around Keanu. And as much as I love Idris Elba, his extensive involvement in Phantom Liberty makes me worried that they will again focus on \"harnessing\" his star power instead of making a good game.\n\nSo I really hope I will hear some familiar voices in Starfield.",

My biggest issue is the over use of the big named voice actors so you end up with like 50 different characters that sound the same in the same game/animation. On the other hand, if too many no named get used, you end up with some really terribly delivered lines. When it comes to famous faces like Keanu it ends up being a breath of fresh air.

Movies don\u2019t become worse because they have \u201cbig\u201d names in them, nor do they automatically become bigger. The key factor is still writing and directing. Troy Baker is a \u201cbig\u201d name too, would the game be worse if he was in it? Or does it only count if what they\u2019re \u201cbig\u201d from mostly includes film and TV?

Or the nomad one that was in the game, and another street one.\n\nLike honestly felt like if they did not have Keanu, they'd have made a game where Jackie was the chip's owner and thru your actions you either have your idol take over his body, recover him as himself, merge the identities in his head, or fail and have him die. \n\nAnd you yourself go with one of the 3 paths.\n\nInstead, you have a game where you need a strong MC (think like Kratos or Geralt) where they tell a story with those characters that have strong traits of those characters, have an MC that is a blank slate that you make in V, but have him or her sounds more like street kid unless there was a special options to bring up your background.",
                "Idk, I don't see an issue if it's a situation like Fallout 3 where Liam Neeson was a voice. I don't disagree that Keanu a little distracting regarding Cyberpunk but some when it's just a voice, it doesn't seem to be as much.",
                "I honestly really don't like them putting real actors in games. It completely breaks the immersion for me. Not only that, but it doesn't let you form your own opinion of the character because you take into account who they actually are, other roles, etc.",

I saw a voice actors resume once and it was amazing all the things they could do that I didn\u2019t even think about.

I think once you base the entire character on someone's likeness, that's where people start to feel distracted. When they're just the voice of something, it's easy to get lost in what they're saying. When it's the whole person being displayed on screen, I personally start thinking about their movies, for instance. Bethesda usually does not base characters on the likeness of the actor, but just how they think the character looks in their respective worlds.",

Sure, it's expensive superfluous fluff that doesn't make the game any better, maybe even arguably worse because of the marketing budget that was spent for an actor instead of spent on the game. \n\nFor the game? Like in Cyberpunk? Hell no, Keanu's acting is incredible(among a lot of the main characters) and a reminder of how strong talent can bring life and emotion to a world that's made up of 1's and 0's.   \n\n\nDeathstranding is another excellent example with some of the best acting I've ever seen in a game, all held together by top famous talent.",

The only time I realize there is a celebrity voice acting is usually when they completely fuck up the job and only was hired because they are a celebrity, and I only find out because I google why the voice acting is so terrible. When it's properly done the  it doesn't matter(e.g. Yakuza series). I don't know enough celebrities to recognize them anyways.",
                "Celebrities in videogame is like using influencers/streamers to promote. \n\nNothing wrong with that, but sometimes it alludes that the devs not confident enough that their product will capture audiences so they use these big names as bait.\n\nSee Cyberpunk and Star Citizen, both games advertised heavily on thier celebs actors. Former flop HARD at release, and the latter is still a tech demo after several years.",

Keanu is probably expensive but some other actor who hasn't been in a good show for a decade or more but is still cool and memorable would be nice. If they are too expensive, the money could be better spent on the devs bug fixing.\n\nAs others have said \"Patrick Stewart as uriel septim vii\" was excellent. Something like that is awesome.",

                "As long as it doesn't detract from the game, it's fine. Portal 2 and GTA San Andreas spring to mind, great games in their own right; and supported by great voice acting from famous actors. That was also them just lending their voices rather than their entire actor persona. \n\nIn my opinion Cyperpunk 2077 was actively made worse by Keanu (in addition to all the other issues). His voice acting felt completely out of place compared to the other actors. Having his 'image' in the game felt like it was made into a selling point by CDPR. I think I also read somewhere that he wanted to have some influence on the script, and it was changed from what it originally was intended to be. His bike brand also made it into the game which felt unnecessary.",

                "Good luck with your business. They don't look good at all to me color style wise but the shapes are cool. Looks like a 5 year old got hold of them with a marker. But maybe if we imagine orcs colored them it's fitting",

The [reply](https://chat.openai.com/share/a53b3b58-1c33-4dea-8d40-21492023b170) and follow-up questions are here.

Yeah, you'll never be able to compete with Danny Devito's raw animal magnetism, but it's shitty for her to say so.",

She was stunning as a young bride, and now in our fifties remains a very attractive woman. \n\nObjectively speaking? There are stars that are prettier. *(Well\u2026 who knows objectively even, right? Who knows when all we ever tend to see is professionally done make up and hair, and working on your body is a routine part of your actual career - both in the gym and under the knife.)*\n\nKnow what? **Who cares.** I married a person, not an image on a screen. Her physical beauty is one piece of the puzzle, it\u2019s the package I married, the package that I find more attractive now after 26 years of marriage than I did the day we said \u201cI do\u201d.\n\nAlways gonna be a more handsome dude out there, my friend.

But looks are not why we're together, in all other aspects we are perfect tens. \n\nBut looks wise? Who cares! We're both attracted to eachother but don't really put emphasis on looks as the foundation of our relationship. She can look at Chris Hemsworth all day and I wouldn't care one bit lol she can look at whoever she wants. A good relationship is built on way more than just looks",

Again .. so what.",

Plus we\u2019re often attracted to the character they\u2019re portraying. \n\nThe difference is she choose you! Women are not just attracted to looks, it\u2019s the whole package. How you can make her feel, the things you share together, how you can make each other laugh, your personalities etc. \n\nWhat she said could have been phrased better yes but you\u2019re both young & things are often said before the brain has fully grasped the impact of it.

Don\u2019t say the part about how your SO is supposed to be the prettiest, that\u2019ll make her defensive because at the core of the question you\u2019re questioning her feelings for you.

Talk to her about it, but don't be jealous of her fantasy. \n\nAnother way to say it: I can admire a beautiful painting in a museum. Does not mean I want it my home. Not even a copy. I would not be comfortable with that picture in my house. That does not mean I cannot admire it in another setting.",

No. \n\nWe all rationally KNOW when people are just conventionally more attractive than we are. And eventually I do think it's healthy to be able to acknowledge that other humans are attractive. It keeps secrets from being secret, you know? Builds trust and honest communication. \n\nHOWEVER, it is not a game to play before you have a solid foundation and absolute trust in the relationship. It is not early relationship conversation. \n\nYou're not in the wrong, but I think it's a gentle conversation to be had as long as she is receptive to it.",

                "She has straight up told you that she thinks you\u2019re less attractive than these men? Leave immediately dude. Do not lower your standards and be with anyone who compares you to anyone ever. That is not love and that is not right. A lot of younger women unfortunately don\u2019t care about men\u2019s feelings and act like their feelings are important but yours aren\u2019t. But they are just as important as hers and I\u2019m sure she wouldn\u2019t appreciate being treated the way she\u2019s treating you, and if she\u2019s willing to treat you (someone she supposedly cares about) like that then she obviously doesn\u2019t respect your feelings. I have absolutely no celebrity crushes and neither does my husband and even if we ever find someone attractive it\u2019s never in a lustful way and we never ever would mention it to eachother. It\u2019s just trashy imo",
                "Not wrong.  I was ready to say the opposite, but the fact that she specifically told you she thinks they're hotter than you is not ok. I agree with you. We can crush on celebrities and think they're attractive, but the person who we are with should be the most attractive to us. For example. I have a crush on this singer of a band, I joke with my hubby that the singer is super hot, etc, but hubby knows I only want him, and he is the best in my eyes.",
                "So what if she thinks other humans are attractive, let alone the most attractive groups of peeps(celebs)?\nEveryone has celeb crushes cuz its like a gossip thing they can talk about for a quick convo, it'll never be more than that. So if youre having jealous emotions over this, i recommend you take a chill pill and realize its nothing serious to be causing commotion over. Also, i get that your gf means alot to you but dont put all your eggs in one baskett.",

It is NOT okay to tell your partner you find these people more attractive in front of their face. + the question was is it wrong for him to feel jealous, which it\u2019s not as that\u2019s a very normal human emotion especially when your own partner says others are better looking, it doesn\u2019t matter if she would never meet these people or not, some things should be kept to yourself.

The Drake stimulus package is a mixed blessing as it has given spotlight to some truly undeserving acts but Summer is not one of them.

                "90% of the time it's some kind of Nepo baby that has ties to everything so they pop out of nowhere.

I feel like she was always a bit part actress and then out of no where it seems she\u2019s had her entire career reframed as being an icon of the screen. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love her, and it\u2019s clear that she\u2019s beloved in the industry, but I feel like the scope in which she\u2019s viewed at the moment is wild.

This also includes accounts that post explicit content anywhere else on Reddit.\n\n\nPlease do not SPAM the group with reposts. This means posting a new pic when you've recently posted, or deleting your old post and reposting a new pic a day or two later, especially if you've not interacted with guessers in the first post (aka you're farming karma). We do notice, and that will result in a temporary or permanent ban, depending on how grouchy your mod team is that day.\n\n\nPlease REPORT comments on your post that are creepy, insulting, harassing, comment on your appearance (positive or negative) or otherwise shitty. We do take them seriously and will ban people who behave like this, with no exceptions.\n\n\nWe will delete any posts where we suspect you are posting someone else's photo. You will be banned and asked to provide a verification picture to remove the ban. (Screenshots are a big red flag).\n\n\nDo not engage with trolls - two wrongs do not make a right. We do take action when comments/posts are reported... give us the time to review, we're not here 24/7.\n\n\nAny other questions?

                "Closest I've got was working for Ron Duprat, which was interesting in mostly a bad way. There are things I could say that could potentially get me sued, so I'll just offer a sample.\n\nThe dude tries to exaggerate his \"celebrity\" status hard. We caught him photoshopping himself into pictures with celebrities. There was one really fishy looking photo of him with Beyonce and Jay-Z. I reverse image searched it and found the original photo, where the actual chef was a French fellow with tens of thousands more likes on social media.\n\nI really only ever saw him doing any actual work when it placed him in the spotlight. For simple things like running to the food warehouse or grocery store for emergency pickups, he'd hand his keys over to particular staff members and have them make the pickups for him. The real kicker here is he consistently chose a couple of foreigners here on work visas, and neither of them had a driver's license, car insurance or a proper understanding of American road laws. Purchasing was a nightmare, so these pickups were a common occurrence. I was constantly terrified of an accident occuring. Loss of human life, harm done to the immigration status of the people in question, our Country Club being sued... I told HR about all of this, and she just sighed and told me there's nothing she can do. The irresponsibility of this man baffled me.\n\nOn a lighter note, the earliest occurrence of us saying under our breaths \"man, fuck this guy\" would be when he'd have banquets set up tables and chairs outside in hundred degree heat, only to say that he changed his mind and wants the event set up inside. So banquets would break everything down outside, set it all up again inside, and Ron would say he preferred the outside setup and wants it there again.\n\nI watched one of his Bar Rescue episodes last year and laughed my ass off when he complained about the amount of frozen food the bar featured in the episode used. Everything we served at our country club under Ron was frozen.\n\nThat's all I can say without fear of him finding this and filing a lawsuit. There's worse that's too personal and damning.",

He's a very concentrated guy, so not very personable i guess? He's polite to the FOH staff, but I always felt like he built a wall between us and him. \n\nBefore service he'd show up, introduce the featured dishes for the night, then retreat to the office and pop his head out to meet and greet guests through the night, then disappeared. He'd never hang around after service like the executive chef or even the owner did. \n\nI honestly believed most of the best dishes actually came from the line of chefs. Everyone was incredibly talented, and many of them went off to do amazing things. \n\nI would say he is a pretty neutral guy from my experience. There are far worse chefs that treat their staff like shit, but Blais would support his staff and give them opportunities to shine.",

They still don't understand that children are not for everyone. And that if people want kids and don't have them then financial situations particularly coming towards middle age are not suitable.

I got a call from production this afternoon that my fitting is canceled and I'm now on hold, and they will let my agent know by Monday if I'm released. I called my agent who had no clue, so she called the producer, who said they want to hire a celebrity now to play my part (likely due to the strike, more famous people are seeking commercial work). She said there's a small chance I'll still be hired, but unlikely. I've been really down on myself today. Feeling like even booking the job doesn't necessarily mean anything anymore. I know it's out of my control but I feel sort of depressed. That national $ at this time would have been so helpful. Has this ever happened to anyone?

Per our union, we still get paid half-time for being booked even if they let us go because it\u2019s understood that if you put so and so dates on hold for a certain opportunity and then they let you go, you missed on the opportunity of booking another gig. It\u2019s also a great incentive for not letting actors go because you\u2019re still paying them anyway.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry this happened to you and I truly hope that there\u2019s a better opportunity coming your way to fill these dates",

                "I'm sorry this happened. Over the years more and more spokesperson spots have been made and it's getting hard for \"no-name\" actors.

You can only control what you can control and that is auditioning.\n\nYou should be proud that you booked it or even getting an avail.

Now, it\u2019s one commercial audition every 4 - 6 weeks.  I have aged into a different type, which hasn\u2019t affected my theatrical opportunities. And there are less union spots being shot, period, but when they are, my age and demographic im these ads are almost always played by celebs.

I understand that this is a business and stuff like this can happen, but usually it\u2019s during casting, not normally when you\u2019ve already booked the part. \n\nGood luck",

It\u2019s happened to me multiple times. It sucks, but it\u2019s just a part of working in the business. You can lose jobs randomly at any time. Someone up the chain will pivot, and you\u2019re gone. Eventually, when it comes to getting paid the big money, you just learn not to take anything for granted until the check is in the bank. Sorry that happened to you.

So far I think it\u2019s good but I was wondering if the storyline gets better or if it goes downhill?\n Update: Thanks for the responses I ended up finishing the series after reading your reviews. I do agree with a lot of you when you said that the ML and FL didn\u2019t have much chemistry. I did like the twist. I do get what the show was trying to get at since I\u2019ve heard a lot of shady stuff about what influencers do to get to where they are I wish they did add more depth to some of the storylines for example siyeon and jukyoungs love story or the main love story between the ml and fl but then again I do understand since they were only limited to 12 episodes. On a scale of 1-10 I\u2019d give the show a 7/10.",

                "In my personal opinion, it was not memorable. I watched the whole series because it was short. I kept hoping it would get better but it never hit me in the \"feels\".",
                "Just finished it last week. I thought it was pretty good esp the commentary on how easy it is to get sucked into social media and wanting the praise. It\u2019s definitely worth finishing just to see what happens. A few twists and turns. I\u2019m glad it\u2019s only 12 episodes; short and to the point. My one complaint is the LACK of chemistry between the ML and FL.",
                "It's pretty basic and doesn't present any new or grand ideas.",
                "It was background noise after a point for me. I only completed it because I was too close to the end. The supporting cast was insufferable. Very makjang in the end.",
                "Not worth it. Overacting by side characters. Chemistry between main characters were meh. Music was horrible.",
                "I liked the idea of the storyline but I do think it could've been executed better. There was so much buildup and suspense till the end only to have not that great of a revelation. I started losing interest halfway through the series but stuck around to find out who bbbfamous was, and when it was finally revealed I wasn't very happy with who it was either. Seemed like a bit of a reach to me.\n\nAnother thing i hated was the absolute lack of chemistry between the ML and FL. Don't get me wrong they portrayed their personal roles really well but their interactions were nowhere near romantic, or butterfly-worthy. The kiss felt random and out of nowhere.\n\nIt wasn't a terrible series, and if you've started it I think you should finish it, but it's nothing incredible either.",
                "You might as well finish since you're almost there but be forewarned it turned into a mess of events towards the end and makes no freaking sense LOL!",
                "It was lame. There was no oomph factor to the show. Had expected better.",
                "It's amazing. Everyone says there's no chemistry between the ML and FL but I think they haven't watched enough of the show. Without spoiling much, the ML's longing looks, everything he does for her because he CAN, and the FLs slow realization that she reciprocates those feelings\u2014 it was intense. If you like romance where they go on dates and have silly banter you won't find it here though",
                "The ending was a twist for me so worth finishing it imo.",
                "I dropped it after 6 episodes. \nThe FL really was lacking. The storyline and the incidents portrayed felt so predictable. \nI was expecting some inside scoop level drama but it was lackluster.",
                "I love fashion so I binge watched it. There\u2019s a twist so finish it",
                "It was really good! It was a nice change to what kdramas I usually watch and I really like it! I agree with the other comments on the low chemistry between the ML and FL but tbh a lot of the cast didn\u2019t have great chemistry \ud83d\ude02",
                "I liked it. Felt it was worth watching for the cameos of actors who appeared as their real selves in each episode. (If you are new and not familiar with various actors, it may not resonate enough to get past the other issues.) To me, the ending seems non-existent, as though it was slated for 16 episodes, but may have been cut due to viewership drop off. Either that or a second season is expected as there is a very open ending that leaves some threads untied. I didn\u2019t care for the young woman who opens the show. They gave her a very one-note roll, and the mystery of her background was not enough to carry her presence. Eventually she begins to come into her own, but the show is better if you somewhat ignore her and concentrate on the veteran agents.",
                "To be honest I rlly liked it, i's true the romance between the ML and the FL was not that spectacular but it gave a light and interesting touch to the kdrama. Personally, I rlly liked the part where a horrible thing happened to the ML it gave a little spice to the series and also the plot twist at the end with the FL was a good thing.",
                "Not worth it!",
                "It\u2019s pretty bad imho. Looots of plot holes and the show forgets what it\u2019s trying to say. Characters change personalities all the time.",
                "I watched it at 1.5x speed because by god, I wanted to finish just for Kang Minhyuk, whom I have loved since day 1. \n\nIt\u2019s not extraordinary or mind blowing, but it is an interesting premise.",
                "I watched it all. Just okay. Somewhat confusing. FL is the best part.",
                "It\u2019s worth finishing. The story is intriguing and the twist\u2026 twisty. This could have been easily 16 eps and would be worth watching. They made it 12 and rush the details a bit. The romance between the leads could\u2019ve been explored more if it was 16. But for 12, she was already a strong, kick-ass FL, so it really wasn\u2019t needed.",
                "I had the same feeling and just skipped to the last episode lol",

A lot of common people do their damn best working their a$$ to take their kids to the parks, and it's unacceptable to me these people, who get in line and patiently wait for their turn and teach their kids to respect  rules and be patient too, have to watch some spoiled celebrity get there last minute and not only avoid the queue and access to the attraction before anyone, but also demand to have it for themselves only.\n\nI get privacy but amusement parks are an experience you have with people. If you want to do it alone and are that rich, make your own amusement park where you can be the lonely kid using attractions to your heart's content. Or just don't go if you can't endure other people using things that were specifically created to be used by many.",

They said that A\u2019s there with her daughter for her daughter\u2019s birthday and wants to focus on her daughter. \n\nMy daughter was very upset because she\u2019s been a fan of A for a very long time so she tried again for a picture but was turned away. \n\nMy daughter was crushed so later that night I made a post talking about my experience with A. How she wouldn\u2019t let anyone go near her and her daughter, the fact that her security was rude, and her not being willing to stop for a couple seconds for a picture. I understand it\u2019s her daughter\u2019s birthday but a 1 minute interaction with a fan isn\u2019t going to ruin her day and if it does, that girl needs to learn that the world doesn\u2019t revolve around her. \n\nThe post ended up getting a lot of attention and a lot of people actually said my daughter and I were being entitled for expecting A to interrupt her daughter\u2019s birthday for everyone that wants a picture. \n\nMy husband also saw the post and said he couldn\u2019t believe that I would bash her for trying to spend the day with her daughter. I\u2019m not trying to bash her for spending the day with her daughter but she wouldn\u2019t be where she is without her fans so I think she at least owes it to them to take a picture. \n\nAITA for making the post about A",

The one he tells about Barbara was that NBC sent her and Larry to the space center to film promotions for the next season of Jennie. 1968, at a guess. They picked dad to be the tour guide because (to this day, he's 83 now) he could make a stone laugh. \n\nBarbara showed up on time and was an absolute sweetheart. They waited an hour and a half, maybe more. When Larry finally showed up he was piss drunk wearing a giant sombrero and poncho. In the Florida heat. Nobody knew why and he refused to explain. Barbara followed along and laughed in all the right places. They had to keep an eye on Larry to make sure he didn't fall into a pond with alligators.

She was as down to earth as someone whose dad was Ron Howard could realistically be. I\u2019m happy for her success, she is a huge talent and a genuine person.\n\nAlso knew Ryan McCarten when he was a teen (13 or 14 maybe?) We worked together in local theater, I was in my early 20s so it\u2019s not like we hung out but I did have a lot of interaction with him backstage. I specifically remember him being a really nice kid, very charismatic, but goofy and cheerful and humble. I actually didn\u2019t know until fairly recently that he became famous in some circles (Disney channel, Broadway, YouTube ?) but when I found out I googled around a bit and found an interview with him where he said he had been a victim of SA and child grooming. I felt so heartbroken learning this and wondered if I had been in his life while this was happening. Child grooming is unfortunately pretty common in the industry (happened to me as well), and it seems like so many stories like this have come to light in recent years. Absolutely gutted to think this could have been happening on one of the shows we worked on together and that I may have known the abuser. :(",

My parents were close enough with them that they would watch me if my parents wanted a night out. I even stayed a weekend with them while my parents went on a short trip. I remember being fine with this, like I was staying with my own grandparents, even though I knew we weren't related. I met Mark a few times when he would come to visit his grandparents.\n\nThey threw a big party for him when he got a \"big movie role\".  Mark and a bunch of his family were there, they were all very nice and friendly. They all gushed over me because, ngl, I was an adorable child :).\n\nLater, Star Wars comes out and we went to see it. I recognized Mark instantly and was confused at first because the grandparents in the movie weren't the same ones that I knew. As the movie progressed, I forgot about all that, and he just became \"Luke Skywalker\". And I became obsessed with Star Wars like every other kid who saw it.\n\nA month (?) or so later, myself and one of my 4 year old friends were playing in the grassy area with my father watching over. Mark Hamill walks by heading to his grandparents place. I yell out, \"THAT'S LUKE SKYWALKER!!!\"\n\nHe stopped and came over to us and talked with my Dad for a moment. Me and my friend were both so excited that we ended up each grabbing a leg in a bear hug and essentially tackled him to the ground. I remember him laughing.

Met her as a very young kid but didn't go to school together until....anywho. We also went to the same church. She was always, always, always focused and obsessed with becoming a world-famous singer. For as far back as I can remember, which is far back. She would sing at church parties and birthday parties and dances, and even then, she had a star quality. When DC was formed, I would go to their shows around town and she and kels would always invite me and whoever I was with backstage. I remember they got booed at one show but kept on going like it was applause. Bee was never outgoing but always friendly and polite. Very earthy and has a sweet southern quality. Kels was very kind as well but extremely insecure, so she had a stand-off personality quirk that made her seem rude. I could not stand LL, and still can't...she is very snobby and rude. LR was super nice and a girl's girl. But back to our queen; known facts: her mom is her best friend, her sister is her advisor, and she mostly hangs out with family. In school, other girls were very, very mean to her while kels was popular and well liked. Fun fact: she started dating her husband a looooooong time ago (b4 18) and he initially broke up with her because of the age difference. Then they got back together about a year later; she has wanted to be his Mrs since...She ADORES that man.",

                "In college, i played on a Division 1 basketball team with two future NBA players.  One is a huge star, and the other is no slouch either.  We are still very friendly to this day.  Whenever their teams come near where I live, they send me as many and whatever kind of tickets I want.  They both will also handle all extenuating factors like having a car hired or party bus, etc, if I am getting a lot of tickets.  Both meet up before and after the ganes if possible, and we always hang out when either are in town.  I have lucked out and gone to every all star gane either of them played in.  When their teams make the playoffs, they both have offered airfare, a place to stay, and amazing tickets to any and all ganes I am willing to go to.  \n\nI dont want anyone to think that these are one-sided relationships.  During our freshman and sophomore summers in college, both teammates and 2 others moved into my families vacation beach house with us.  They all consider my mom like their own, and she treats them like they are her kids.  Neither of the two players either had no relationship or very brutal relationships with their own parents.  So anytime I went home, those first two years, if they were free, they came with.  This continued to a lesser degree since then.  One of the two players has me train with him in his off-season and flies my mom out there as often she is willing.  It amounts to a couple of weeks a year, but they are very close, which is awesome.  \n\nI can easily say these two guys are two of my best friends and two of the best friends you could have.  Now that one of them has married and has a kid, we see less of each other in person.  We still talk all the time, and I see him at his games at least a dozen times a year.  The much more well-known players' relationship with me hasn't changed at all.  Besides meeting at his games, we vacation together, and I spend part of his off-season training time with him.  He is the one who has my mother come out for a couple of weeks a year, too.  They have a very mother/son relationship, which is lovely.  \n\nI think the both of them like having friends from before the NBA who still treat them the same way.  The school we played at was quite far from where both of them lived.  We got close, and it's been like that ever since.\n\nI also went to high school with a musician who is in a very popular band.  He is well known on his own, too.  I have known him since pre-k.  Whenever he is in town, we get together.  He will offer me tickets with all logistics covered.  A few times a year, he will ask me to fly out for a concert, not close to where I live, so we can hang out.  He has brought me or gotten me into all sorts of events and such I would never have even dreamed of going to.  The first thing he asks about when he talks to me is my mom( notice a pattern). \n\nThe summer before our sophomore year of high school, his folks got divorced, and both were moving out of state.  His mom was moving out for two years and then coming back, though.  Long story short, my mom offered for him to live with us and continue at the same high school where his bandmates were located.  They had just started to gain some decent popularity.  He lived with us for a summer plus 2 years.  Obviously, we were already close, and this made us closer.  In fact, he has offered to buy a home for my mother or other extravagant gifts(they are close, but he also think his band might have broken up if he moved) but my mom has turned it down.  She has accepted concert tickets and a couple of trips for her and her man and their friends, though.  \n\nHe treats me like he always has.  We act the sane way we always did.",

I actually had one class with him and found him to be a really good public speaker.

Golden was infamous at our school for his music, which he proudly released on SoundCloud and promoted on his socials. At the time, people saw him as just another \u201cSoundCloud rapper\u201d and made fun of him and his music behind his back. No one thought anything would come of his music, but Golden did and continued to drop songs. \n\nA few years later, Golden made it big. He did well academically at our rigorous magnet high school and got into USC, which he attended for a short time before dropping out because his music career took off. Once his music started gaining traction, everyone from high school suddenly switched up and became supportive. He was in a top frat at USC. \n\nI remember hearing his song, \u201cMood,\u201d on the radio for the first time and recording a video of the moment because it was so surreal that someone I went to high school with was playing on the radio.

When this didn't happen, they trashed the place. This fed into stories about them being crazy rock stars. But the reason was actually because: Van Halen had a live show with tons of pyrotechnics and as such, required very extensive and strict safety regulations to be adhered to by the venue in order for the show to be safe. They stuffed the clause about the M&Ms in the middle of the safety requirements where it wouldn't get noticed unless you were carefully reading through them. So if the band got to a venue and didn't see the M&Ms, it pretty much always meant that the venue hadn't read through the rest of the safety requirements thoroughly and they would look into it immediately and find out that yep, doing their show at this site would be unsafe.\n\nBut because they were Van Halen they also liked to be divas about it and trash the place because why not?",

So - we go. And - it's closed. So there's me, and Keith Moon, and David Crosby, breaking into that little sweets shop, eh. Well, instead of a guard dog, they've got this bloody great big Bengal tiger.

                "I can\u2019t remember what band it was, but they used to hide the most ridiculous demands in their list, and if it wasn\u2019t in their dressing room they would know the place never read the list so they didn\u2019t feel safe.\nEG, that asked for all brown m&ms and if they didn\u2019t see a bowl of all brown m&ms then no one read their roadie list",

She needs to calm down and get over herself a bit.\n\nJack White is lucky to be even mentioned in this list.\n\nKanye is borderline Diva. Creativity is a type of intelligence and Kanye was right on the line between genius and wacko, and he accidentally tripped and fell into the wacko side.

Some were before I was married, but I've had it happen after, too, and I know exactly what I did; politely declined, sometimes even advised they get help, depending on the situation.    \n\n\nMy wife has been amazing to me and loves me for who I am without hesitation, weirdness and all.  Why would I screw that up??  For the \\*idea\\* of a moment with someone a younger me liked the \\*idea\\* of being with.  \n\n\nThe older a man gets, the more he realizes that NO partner will be perfect, but if you find someone where you're perfect \\*for each other\\*? You'd be a fool to let that go.  And that's with me being busy as hell, stressed, and not always having as many date nights as I'd like, but I would not trade her for the world.    \n\n\nNow as others have said, I absolutely \\*would\\* wear the fact that such a person hit me up as a feather in my cap for the rest of my life.  And as with the others who've come out of the woodwork to proposition me, I would tell my wife asap.    \n\n\nNot because she'd have anything to worry about, she and I trust each other implicitly, but because she'd want ALL the tea...  She and I hate gossip-mongering and don't believe in spreading rumors across the masses.  We WILL, however, share ALL the gossip with each other in a closed-loop fashion that stays JUST with us.   \n\n\nA situation like the OP's, and my telling her about it after?  That would be \\*gold\\* for us.  We could make a week or more of \"Tell me the tea, baby!\" and some fine date-night dinner banter on that alone.",

I'd politely refuse, and propose friendship with me and my wife - inconspicuously not allowing any activity where my wife isn't present, even if it's a \"friends activity\", but I wouldn't express that as it could be taken as lack of trust or any kind of assumption on my side, which is not the case nor reason for it. I wouldn't feel comfortable otherwise, and I can't see that there's any need for it to be in any other way. Even wanting to vent something private without others hearing, it is possible to ask for 15 minutes to talk about whatsoever trauma in the living room, while my wife and kids prepare some ice cream or whatsoever. \n\nYes I do know some artists, due to background  - but all I see is the struggle and the uncomfortable point they face, with people forgetting they are humans, regular people who have gotten successful at X job.

I treat them normally\n\nAnd someone being an ass, honestly it doesn't matter if they are famous or not  \ud83d\ude06  two members of X band, nearly done recording the videoclip back then, as we were talking, turned out to be ..well, on the aforementioned category  \ud83d\udc40  they got actually upset how normally I treated them, seems they liked to be treated as rarities or something, so they started being rather rude and uninterested. I smiled, and the band leader plus two other members, smiled like I'd never seen them smile, their eyes shined like diamonds, and said to just \"ignore *them* ....they are just like *that* ... \ud83d\ude03\" and continued talking further into the previous topic, with much more interest though, putting an arm around my shoulders all happy, leaving the other two behind \ud83d\ude02  they were even more pissed\n\nBut this to say, it's lovely.

When I share a post or reel I usually do it with my brothers and BF. Most of my followers and the people I follow are people I\u2019ve spoken with face to face, with the exception of a very few celebrities. So\u2026 I used to follow the official account of this celebrity, let\u2019s call him \u201cMichael\u201d, and every now and then, say, one or twice a year, I\u2019d leave a comment on a picture. Because I was not interested anymore or didn\u2019t find anything amusing, I stopped following his account. Two or three days later I got a message request from \u201chis\u201d manager. Being a 30 y.o. married and very pregnant woman with kids, I asked for proof but then just thought it probably was a scam and reported/blocked the account. I thought it was fake and forgot about it. What\u2019s fun is I had just been talking about this celebrity to my husband and saying how I admire how he expresses himself in interviews and how his answers are always thoughtful and\u2026 not celebrity-like. Well, the thing is\u2026 after I blocked the manager\u2019s account, the official, Instagram verified, 30M+ account sent me a follow request. I got the notification and being as millennial as I am, I didn\u2019t think of taking a screenshot, I just opened the notification, very surprised, and saw the request, and as soon as I saw it, he deleted it. So I have no proof, but I also have no doubts of what I saw.\nBy the way, the manager did send me shots of her conversation with the celebrity, but I just thought they were edited. In those messages he mentioned how he wanted to meet me, why, and some stuff I mentioned in my comments/messages. \nWhat would have I done had he proposed to me? I would have let it boost my ego, but I\u2019d have reported or blocked him.\nI love my husband. I married him because he was the man of my dreams. What else can I ask for?",

We saw all kinds of animals, from lions and tigers to penguins and flamingos. But the highlight of the day was when we ran into a celebrity at the reptile house.\nWe were looking at the snakes and lizards when I noticed a familiar face in the crowd. It was none other than Pete Buttigieg, the U.S. Secretary of Transportation! He was wearing a baseball cap and sunglasses, but I recognized him right away. He was with his husband and a couple of security guards, but he seemed very relaxed and friendly.\nI\u2019m a big fan of his, so I decided to approach him and say hello. I was nervous, but he was very nice and polite. He shook my hand and asked me my name and where I was from. I told him I was from St. Louis and that I admired his work. He thanked me and said he was in town to announce some funding for the MetroLink. He said he loved the zoo and that it was his first time visiting it.\nWe chatted for a few minutes and he asked me what my favorite animal was. I said I liked the elephants, but they were closed for renovation. He said he liked the turtles, because they reminded him of his childhood pet. He then asked me if I wanted to take a picture with him. Of course I said yes!\nHe took off his sunglasses and cap and smiled for the camera. I snapped a selfie with him and thanked him for his time. He wished me a good day and went back to his group. I was so happy and excited that I met him. He was such a cool and down-to-earth guy.\nI showed the picture to my family and they couldn\u2019t believe it. They were jealous that I met him and they didn\u2019t. They asked me why I didn\u2019t call them over, but I didn\u2019t want to bother him too much. Plus, it was kind of nice to have a personal moment with him.\nI posted the picture on Instagram and Twitter and it got a lot of likes and comments. Some people congratulated me, some people joked that he looked like a turtle, and some people asked me if he smelled good (he did). It was awesome.\nSo that\u2019s my story of meeting Pete Buttigieg at the St. Louis Zoo today. It was a once-in-a-lifetime experience that I will never forget.

We were not the last people there as an older couple came in and sat right next to us. The woman next to me and her husband next to her. I notice many heads repeatedly turning around to look at us and that's when my wife informs me that John Smoltz has sat next to us. \n\nThis was the year he joined our team and me being a huge Cardinals fan, I felt it was my duty to welcome him properly to Saint Louis. Needless to say I saw nothing of the movie as I pondered the perfect greeting to bestow of John and his family. My wife kept smirking at me as she knew how hard the hamster wheel was turning in my head. All I was doing was trying out greetings in my head and eating popcorn....lots of popcorn. \n\nThe movie ends and though I've settled on a proper greeting for a future hall of famer, I had no idea how I was going start my greeting other than just shamelessly fan boying and blurting things out. That's when fate stepped in and helped me out (so I thought) Mrs Smoltz  stood up and the BlackBerry that was forgotten in her lap hit the floor right in front of me. \n\nI immediately pounced on the opportunity as I realized I now had a legitimate reason to address them. I bent over quickly to grab her phone and that's when the large, heavily buttered popcorn I ate got it's revenge. Time stood still for me as very large extended silent but deadly fart escaped me....right into the face of Mrs Smotlz. Panicking I almost three the phone at here, grabbed my wife's hand and drug her past both of them and made a hasty retreat out of the theater. \n\n\nAnd that's how I welcomed a future Hall of fame baseball player to Saint Louis.",

He wasn\u2019t super chatty but he wasn\u2019t rude and I was too intimidated to say much. Another time I sat next to Scott Bakula, his wife, and his kids on a flight from LA to STL. They were so gracious and friendly. The stewardesses wouldn\u2019t leave him alone and it got a little weird.  Once ran into Dick Vermeil in the baggage claim at Lambert right after the Rams won the Super Bowl against the Titans.  He was standing off by himself in the back, which is where I go to claim bags because it\u2019s quieter and you don\u2019t have to force your way up to the carousel. I didn\u2019t recognize him at first, then it hit me so I just said \u201cNice job.\u201d  He said \u201cThanks\u201d and that was that. But it was nice. There have been quite a few, but my favorite was probably Gerard Way. He was just super nice and chill.  His comic Violin Academy had just been released and coincidentally I was reading it. I didn\u2019t have any idea it was him because he was wearing a hoodie and sun glasses (on an evening flight) but hew saw what I was reading and asked me if I liked it. Fun conversation ensued. \n\nGreat topic OP\u2026I hadn\u2019t thought of these in a long time.",

            "selftext": "No, I am not revealing who it was, and she was not a major celebrity, 90%+ of you probably haven't even heard of her. I hadn't heard of her name, although I somewhat recognized her face. She was in a few high school/college movies back in the 90s/00s, that's about it. She was very, very pretty. Like outstandingly pretty, and pretty much all of her roles were 'pretty girl' roles like model or cheerleader. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI found out through his old friend bringing it up mid conversation without knowing that my husband kept it a secret. I confronted him about it after and he just spilled the whole story. They dated for nearly a year. Broke up because she had to move permanently to LA for work (go figure). The reason he never told me was that he didn't want me to compare myself to her. He said he specifically kept her away from me because he thought I would feel bad about myself in comparison to her. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis plays into another issue in our relationship. We have a... gap, between us. I am frumpy and overweight and I am well aware my face isn't too pretty. He has always been attractive, if not straight up very, very attractive. He works out, has a great job, is very productive. I have an autoimmune disease that makes me fatigued constantly, and I work part time at a low wage job. I think at this stage in our relationship we are both aware of the gap between us in more ways than one. He still loves me and I sometimes genuinely don't know why. He could have basically any woman in the world. But in my view, his 'experience' was pretty slim, he had only had two girlfriends before me as far as I knew. Turns out there was a very important third girlfriend missing from his past, of course. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut still, this hurt. And its upsetting, because even though I hate the fact that he lied to me, he was kind of right. I am really upset that he dated this girl. She is drop dead gorgeous. She was an actress and a model (even if her career never rly took off...). It does honestly deeply hurts my self esteem. And so in some ways he was right to keep it from me I guess? But I still can barely even look at him right now. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am just confused and hurt at all of this. It does make me think of things differently. It makes me more self conscious about 'the gap' than anything has previously. How am I even supposed to react? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - - husband kept from me that he dated a famous actress before we met because he knew it  would hurt my self esteem. ",

It's nuts. We're all guilty of it, but you're at a point where you're letting it ruin a happy relationship.\n\nIt's hard to feel sick and tired a lot. It's hard to feel less productive.

He picked you from all the women he had a chance with and decided to make YOU his life partner.  He sees something in you as more special than anything he has ever found before.  Don\u2019t let him down with these insecurities.  Get therapy if you need to to address these frustrations you have with your current self, but also seek to see why he picked you.

Why he chose me if he previously chose someone very different? Why his taste changed that much? He did not broke up with her, she left.\nVery hard to get these thoughts out of your head and I would not be able to do it by myself. And his explanation would not be enough.\n\nFor me it would be also breaking of trust. It is one of three gf he had and maybe it had a great impact on him and his personality. If you are accepting everything about a person when you two come together, but another person keeps a secret, it's a breaking of trust and it is hard to trust a person comletely after that. Even if you understand that intentions were good. You can understand it perfectly, but still cannot accept it. \n\nAnd finally, I feel that there is no gap between you two and you are a fantastic person who underestimates herself and I wish you to resolve all the issues between you two \u2764\ufe0f",

Perhaps if he told you earlier in the relationship, you will have the feeling of insecurity throughout the relationship on a consistent basis. It will come up in arguments or even random conversations. It was always linger in the back of your mind about this woman. Which is unhealthy for both you and him because you will always compare yourself to her.\n\nAs the previous comments said, he loves you, chose you & wants to spend his life with you. So there shouldn\u2019t be any need of insecurity. The best thing you can do for yourself is try to reach your potential.

You\u2019d be taking away his agency.\n\nSeems like both of you need a deep and long talk about the core of your relationship. I find it odd that you have no idea why your husband loves you.

That kind of men are awful. \n\nKnowing the exes were hot, is painful to find out; but as long as you repeat to yourself \u201cI am more than my appearance, I am worth full, I am more than enough, I have more to offer than just my body\u201d, this feeling of being mad at him for dated her, will disappear.",

She's beautiful, like a princess, and very lovely too. And guess what, she said the same about me! She told me that I'm so pretty and lovely, and always complimentary about me. \n\nWe always look at our imperfections and compare it with other's perfections, especially with today's social medias.

                "Don't sweat it dude, think about it this way, all the girls in the world and he'd rather be with you. Heck, he MARRIED you. You know how big of a commitment that is? He is so incredibly considerate of your feelings in his own little way. Some things you can ponder on, was she a long term girlfriend? Was it a fling? How old were they? Why did they call it off? Because answering all of this will make you realise that you relationship with him is way bigger than any of that! If she didn't really mean too much to him and it's all in the past then you should be able to laugh it off and infact maybe, just maybe be proud that your husband wakes up and chooses you everyday - does exactly that. Wakes up and chooses you. Everyday. And he has been with you for 6 years OFCOURSE he is aware that you are conscious and a little nervous I'm life about the things that you pointed out. This might infact just be a symptom of a bigger problem - your take on yourself. Maybe seek some therapy and talk about this, find a way to be grateful for what you have everyday and brush off the negative because you deserve way more than this little negative dialogue in your head. You ARE way more than that, and your husband recognises and loves that and maybe never wants you to feel that way and hence kept it from you! Don't let this eat on you :)",
                "I have a couple of thoughts. My husband is better looking than I am, too. It definitely does make me feel insecure from time to time but neither of us chose the other person based on physical appearance so it's not something I think about often. I am pretty sure that his last GF was an attractive girl (also younger, I'm a bit older which can be a source of insecurity as well) but she wasn't very kind to him so he prioritized finding a nice person instead. Just because your husband didn't choose you for your looks doesn't mean that he didn't still choose you. Looks are just not the most important thing to some people, especially when you're in the market for someone to spend your life with. You want someone who makes you laugh, has empathy, and that you can trust, and whether they look super hot while doing it is often a lower priority. \n\n\nI will say that I do still make an effort with my looks and that honestly helps me a lot, feeling like I have done what I can. Like I will never have great bone structure but there's a lot you can do to look generally better and I feel better about myself when I know I have tried my best. \n\n\nAlso your self esteem issues are more to do with you than your husband. I know you say you have an autoimmune disorder so you might not have the energy to be a gym rat hardbody with a high-powered career, but I'm sure you can do better than frumpy and underpaid and sad about it. There are minimal effort things you can do to look better like getting your hair done and buying more flattering clothes. Even if you aren't going to work as much as he does, there are changes you could make in your career or training that would help you get a more fulfilling part-time role. Even just taking up a challenging and fulfilling new hobby can help you feel competent and interesting. What I'm hearing is that you feel shitty about yourself and you aren't doing anything to change it.",
                "He was right not to tell you. You found out and now you're spiraling. He should have told all his friends not to tell you too. He did nothing wrong. He went above and beyond to protect you. And now that he's failed, it's your turn to do the work and do something about your fragile self-esteem. There is only so much he can do, we are well past the point where it's your turn to do the work to hold yourself together after finding out your husband of six years had a hot ex.",
                "Lack of self esteem/confidence can be a huge turnoff. If someone doesn't like themselves or see their own value, why would anyone else? I've had these issues myself all my life but it's not attractive at all. Your husband loves you and chooses you every day...but if you don't work on healing yourself you will drive him away. There's no reason he had to tell you about this really... nor should it be an issue in your relationship. I'n the nicest possible way, please seek counselling to learn how to love and appreciate yourself.",

I know how it feels to hate how you look - I have an autoimmune disease too, I have hashimotos and hypothyroidism, caused be to put on 5 stone. It's really difficult to get rid of, even with dietary changes and medication. I constantly feel tired, sore and fat. My bf tells me I look beautiful all the time, and while I appreciate it, it's about how I FEEL about myself that's the issue. I think your issue is the same. At the end of the day, he chose you, you are married, he loves you. But that's not going to help - the issue is how you feel about yourself.\n\nWhat autoimmune disease is it you have? Autoimmune runs in my family, my mum and brother also have different diseases. I want to add, constantly feeling unwell, and fatigued will lower your mood. You'll feel frustrated, maybe guilty and a lot in my case depressed.\n\nI think it's important to keep that in mind. I would talk to your husband about your low self esteem and worries, and also book an appointment with a therapist. It will help, it won't be overnight, but it'll be a good start.",
                "Chin up!! Autoimmune diseases are nothing that stands in your way to feel your best. If you want and only if you want, you could set a goal of how much you liked to weight and how active you would like to be. Then you just create a weekly meal plan and training schedule and stick to it 80% of the time. Then start practicing healthy habits mental well-being, diet and exercise. Two years ago I came off SSRI which had made me gain 45 pounds. It took some time before I realized how much I gained. I am 160 cm tall and weight 124 pounds. It took me two years to loose the weight. First year I focused on getting in as much exercise as I could while making portion size smaller. I then got a knee injury in spring year 2 so I changed approach. I reduced calories to 1100/day. Even if I was inactive I still lost weight. I focused on mental health and diet instead of exercise and diet. I would say year 1 gave my the tools to listen in to my body and year 2 I felt so much prettier I have changed clothing style and now wear makeup etc. I have confidence in my body and I can see that other guys looks at me which also gives a nice confidence boost.",

                "He did the right thing. It would have, and now did, hurt your self esteem. \n\nI've been in a similar situation as him. Was on a couple of dates with a very famous celeb and had sex with her. I never tell women I date or women I'm in a relationship with, about it. They will compare themselves to her, of course they would. \n\nThe important thing is that he is with you now. He is not with her. He chose you and you should be happy about that."

                "I got one that's not typically associated with our generation. But for me it was ***John Denver*** dying in a plane crash in 1997. Some context, When I was a kid I was always attracted to music from the 1960's and 1970's above all else, though I do have deep appreciation for music of the 80's and 90's as well, more so now that I've aged some.\n\nMy dad at the time was about the age I am now (35) and was dealing with a pretty deep depression and because of such, he and I had a fairly strained relationship for much of my childhood, but the first time he and I truly bonded over music, was when he took me with him to recapture a bit of his own childhood by purchasing the live album known as [An Evening with John Denver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8u4V-cJLHw&ab_channel=MusicIsItsOwnLanguage).\n\nI will never forget the car ride home, we lived in the country back then so the drive back home from the city was more than a half hour and we wound up parking in the driveway at home and finishing the album together. My dad explained to me that John Denver's music reminds him of road trips he used to take with my grandmother and his brothers back in 1970's, she would always play John Denver on those long trips from our home state of Texas all the way through New Mexico and up through California all the way to Washington state. It was a true father son bonding experience over the joy of music and one of my most cherished, though I've never told him or anyone actually the full detail of this memory until now for some reason.\n\nAnyway, When John Denver died in 1997 I remember seeing it on the news the evening of the day it happened and being absolutely crushed. I've always had John Denver on my playlist and in strange twist of fate, now at 35 I find myself struggling with varying degree's of depression, but then I roll out some John Denver and in his own way, tells me don't worry, just look at the mountains, look at the tree's the Forrest and the streams, isn't it magnificent, and I just can't not be in a better mood when I hear him sing passionately about his love of nature or being at one with it all.\n\nHis death is particularly tragic to me, not only because he was only 53 years old at the time, but also because if you listen to his last written song which he never even got to properly record in a studio [Yellow Stone Coming Home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3K_HstCoYw&ab_channel=ClarkKauffman) he was clearly on the verge of returning to his roots and escaping the adult contemporary artist image to get back to his early days singer/songwriter Folk music. I have no doubt he would have had some banger albums on into the 2000's had he lived.\n\nIn any case, his music has now rippled through my family for three generations, it aided in strengthening my relationship with my father, inspired me to pick up the guitar for myself, take flying lessons and ultimately helps me battle depression on daily basis. Johns early environmental activism has even encouraged me to do and be better at taking care of nature.\n\nSo, in closing, thanks for the music John, you achieved what all good artist hope to, you inspired in more ways that one.",

            "title": "Using DeepFace to prove that when training individual people, using celebrity instance tokens result in better trainings and that regularization is pointless",
            "selftext": "I've spent the last several days experimenting and there is no doubt whatsoever that using celebrity instance tokens is far more effective than using rare tokens such as \"sks\" or \"ohwx\". I didn't use x/y grids of renders to subjectively judge this. Instead, I used DeepFace to automatically examine batches of renders and numerically charted the results. I got the idea from u/CeFurkan and one of his YouTube tutorials. DeepFace is available as a Python module.\n\nHere is a simple example of a DeepFace Python script:\n\n    from deepface import DeepFace\n    img1_path = path_to_img1_file\n    img2_path = path_to_img2_file\n    response = DeepFace.verify(img1_path = img1_path, img2_path = img2_path)\n    distance = response['distance']\n\nIn the above example, two images are compared and a dictionary is returned. The 'distance' element is how close the images of the people resemble each other. The lower the distance, the better the resemblance. There are different models you can use for testing.\n\nI also experimented with whether or not regularization with generated class images or with ground truth photos were more effective. And I also wanted to find out if captions were especially helpful or not. But I did not come to any solid conclusions about regularization or captions. For that I could use advice or recommendations. I'll briefly describe what I did.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**THE DATASET**\n\nThe subject of my experiment was Jess Bush, the actor who plays Nurse Chapel on *Star Trek: Strange New Worlds*. Because her fame is relatively recent, she is not present in the SD v1.5 model. But lots of photos of her can be found on the internet. For those reasons, she makes a good test subject. Using [starbyface.com](https://starbyface.com), I decided that she somewhat resembled Alexa Davalos so I used \"alexa davalos\" when I wanted to use a celebrity name as the instance token. Just to make sure, I checked to see if \"alexa devalos\" rendered adequately in SD v1.5.\n\n[25 dataset images, 512 x 512 pixels](https://preview.redd.it/29kgybodthib1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e7d65a3c34ac6e6b3332bfd75d6ec56ed360ceed)\n\nFor this experiment I trained full Dreambooth models, not LoRAs. This was done for accuracy. Not for practicality. I have a computer exclusively dedicated to SD work that has an A5000 video card with 24GB VRAM. In practice, one should train individual people as LoRAs. This is especially true when training with SDXL.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TRAINING PARAMETERS**\n\nIn all the trainings in my experiment I used Kohya and SD v1.5 as the base model, the same 25 dataset images, 25 repeats, and 6 epochs for all trainings. I used BLIP to make caption text files and manually edited them appropriately. The rest of the parameters were typical for this type of training.\n\nIt's worth noting that the trainings that lacked regularization were completed in half the steps. Should I have doubled the epochs for those trainings? I'm not sure.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**DEEPFACE**\n\nEach training produced six checkpoints. With each checkpoint I generated 200 images in ComfyUI using the default workflow that is meant for SD v1.x. I used the prompt, \"headshot photo of \\[instance token\\] woman\", and the negative, \"smile, text, watermark, illustration, painting frame, border, line drawing, 3d, anime, cartoon\". I used Euler at 30 steps.\n\nUsing DeepFace, I compared each generated image with seven of the dataset images that were close ups of Jess's face. This returned a \"distance\" score. The lower the score, the better the resemblance. I then averaged the seven scores and noted it for each image. For each checkpoint I generated a histogram of the results.\n\nIf I'm not mistaken, the conventional wisdom regarding SD training is that you want to achieve resemblance in as few steps as possible in order to maintain flexibility. I decided that the earliest epoch to achieve a high population of generated images that scored **lower than 0.6** was the best epoch. I noticed that subsequent epochs do not improve and sometimes slightly declined after only a few epochs. This aligns what people have learned through conventional x/y grid render comparisons. It's also worth noting that even in the best of trainings there was still a significant population of generated images that were above that 0.6 threshold. I think that as long as there are not many that score above 0.7, the checkpoint is still viable. But I admit that this is debatable. It's possible that with enough training most of the generated images could score below 0.6 but then there is the issue of inflexibility due to over-training.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**CAPTIONS**\n\nTo help with flexibility, captions are often used. But if you have a good dataset of images to begin with, you only need \"\\[instance token\\] \\[class\\]\" for captioning. This default captioning is built into Kohya and is used if you provide no captioning information in the file names or corresponding caption text files. I believe that the dataset I used for Jess was sufficiently varied. However, I think that captioning did help a little bit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**REGULARIZATION**\n\nIn the case of training one person, ***regularization is not necessary***. If I understand it correctly, regularization is used for preventing your subject from taking over the entire class in the model. If you train a full model with Dreambooth that can render pictures of a person you've trained, you don't want that person rendered each time you use the model to render pictures of other people who are also in that same class. That is useful for training models containing multiple subjects of the same class. But if you are training a LoRA of your person, regularization is irrelevant. And since training takes longer with SDXL, it makes even more sense to not use regularization when training one person. Training without regularization cuts training time in half.\n\nThere is debate of late about whether or not using real photos (a.k.a. ground truth) for regularization increases quality of the training. I've tested this using DeepFace and I found the results inconclusive. Resemblance is one thing, quality and realism is another. In my experiment, I used photos obtained from [Unsplash.com](https://Unsplash.com) as well as several photos I had collected elsewhere.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**THE RESULTS**\n\nThe first thing that must be stated is that most of the checkpoints that I selected as the best in each training can produce good renderings. Comparing the renderings is a subjective task. This experiment focused on the numbers produced using DeepFace comparisons.\n\nAfter training variations of rare token, celebrity token, regularization, ground truth regularization, no regularization, with captioning, and without captioning, the training that achieved the best resemblance in the fewest number of steps was this one:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[celebrity token, no regularization, using captions](https://preview.redd.it/ptmvrpfgvhib1.png?width=654&format=png&auto=webp&s=c278c67f8c849ad5d91e8abc0a5b1c7dcf9f1ce7)\n\nCELEBRITY TOKEN, NO REGULARIZATION, USING CAPTIONS\n\n    Best Checkpoint:....5\n    Steps:..............3125\n    Average Distance:...0.60592\n    % Below 0.7:........97.88%\n    % Below 0.6:........47.09%\n\nHere is one of the renders from this checkpoint that was used in this experiment:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Distance Score: 0.62812](https://preview.redd.it/0gbw9z6ixhib1.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=1b3480cb7b09f98e7db516f6a2d2e1896764fe1f)\n\nTowards the end of last year, the conventional wisdom was to use a unique instance token such as \"ohwx\", use regularization, and use captions. Compare the above histogram with that method:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[\\\\\"ohwx\\\\\" token, regularization, using captions](https://preview.redd.it/m66hwy8rvhib1.png?width=654&format=png&auto=webp&s=531c3d50016fe21bbdac01a1d221d9790daa462e)\n\n\"OHWX\" TOKEN, REGULARIZATION, USING CAPTIONS\n\n    Best Checkpoint:....6\n    Steps:..............7500\n    Average Distance:...0.66239\n    % Below 0.7:........78.28%\n    % Below 0.6:........12.12%\n\n[A recently published YouTube tutorial](https://youtu.be/N_zhQSx2Q3c) states that using a celebrity name for an instance token along with ground truth regularization and captioning is the very best method. ***I disagree***. Here are the results of this experiment's training using those options:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[celebrity token, ground truth regularization, using captions](https://preview.redd.it/apg7v0x8whib1.png?width=654&format=png&auto=webp&s=fbc02a6237e90883d104e945d87675d1cc548c48)\n\nCELEBRITY TOKEN, GROUND TRUTH REGULARIZATION, USING CAPTIONS\n\n    Best Checkpoint:....6\n    Steps:..............7500\n    Average Distance:...0.66239\n    % Below 0.7:........91.33%\n    % Below 0.6:........39.80%\n\nThe quality of this method of training is **good**. It renders images that appear similar in quality to the training that I chose as best. However, it took 7,500 steps. More than twice the number of steps I chose as the best checkpoint of the best training. I believe that the quality of the training might improve beyond six epochs. But the issue of flexibility lessens the usefulness of such checkpoints.\n\nIn all my training experiments, I found that captions improved training. The improvement was significant but not dramatic. It can be very useful in certain cases.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**CONCLUSIONS**\n\nThere is no doubt that using a celebrity token vastly accelerates training and dramatically improves the quality of results.\n\nRegularization is ***useless*** for training models of individual people. All it does is double training time and hinder quality. This is especially important for LoRA training when considering the time it takes to train such models in SDXL.",

                "I think the point of regularization is to prevent your training data from dominating the entire model, when all woman, dogs and birds all start looking the same. So in that testing indeed regularization would work against it, but that doesn't mean it's bad.",

                "When you are using a brand new token, there is no existing information to leverage, so training essentially starts at random. Which means it take more training epochs for the model to learn the fundamentals like \"new token is a human\", \"new token is a female\", \"new token is a blonde\", and so on. Intuitively, regularization would help with this initial phase of learning the fundamentals about this new token because regularization smooths out or spreads out the weights more, allowing the model to establish better connections for the new token's meaning. \n\nIt makes sense that using a celebrity's name results in better training because the model already have the basic fundamental information about said celebrity.",

Keep it up. \n\nFrom my understanding, it doesn't make sense to me that you would use random regularization images, I used to have this debate with people when db first came out. It's not logical. The images should come from the model, since you want it to retain prior knowledge FROM the model itself and not over-fit with your new information.",

So I believe  quality still should be evaluated by human eyes\n\nAlso using groundth truth reg images will always better fine tune your model. That is how the model initially trained. But is a trade off between time and quality\n\nOne more mistake is experimenting with celebrities. You need to experiment with your own self to see real results",
                "I would be curious what distance scores you would get between your two test subjects before any training. I haven't used Deep Face, but I know that in DLib 0.6 represents a pretty large distance between faces. You need close to 0.5 for a positive identity match. Looking at the Deep Face GitHub, I'm seeing distance values like 0.25 for the same identity. So I'm wondering whether the distance scores you're getting after training mean \"these people look a little similar,\" which is where you started before training.",
                "Just provide my feedback on this. If you are training Asians, don't use celebrity. It will mess up your traing massively.\n\nThe problem is that SD doesn't know many Asian celebrities and even if it does, for example  Chang Chen, it got confused so easily when you add other tokens beside words like Chen.\n\nI wasted so many times following this \"conclusion.\" \n\nThe only takeaway should have is that people can only have time to test certain aspects of training and you always have to find out yourself.\n\nTo OP, have you tried to use the same methodology with other ethic groups? The issue here is names. Chinese names for example have relatively few letters and it could cause confusion to the model.",

                "Hey there, so I'm the one who made the [recently published YouTube tutorial](https://youtu.be/N_zhQSx2Q3c), it took me more than 10 days of testing and training (and hundreds in GPU renting) to find the right parameters for SDXL lora training which is why I \"kinda\" have to disagree \"just a little bit\" with the findings and I mean in a way it's almost a matter of opinion at this point.... indeed as I said in my tutorial, using a combination of celebrity names that looks like the character you are trying to train + caption + regularization images made in my testing the best models (for the celebrity trick I just followed what u/mysteryguitarm told me so thanks for that).   \nThe problem here I suppose is regularization images, because I made tests with and without and tbh I prefer models made WITH regularization images, I found that the models it created looked a bit more like the character and were also sometimes following the prompt a bit better, albeit the difference are very small that's true.... and indeed if you consider the fact that using reg image MULTIPLY BY 2 the amount of final steps with only a small increase in quality, why even bother with them?   \nWell that's a very good point and in a way I agree, If I need to make a very quick LORA and just make a good model, I won't use REG images... It will just take twice as long for training...like who has time for that?? However again as I said, I personally saw the difference and for the sake of the tutorial to show people what the best method I personally found that yieled the best results for me, it was: celebrity + caption + reg images which is way I showed that in my video for people to follow.   \n\n\nAnd again if you find that reg images don't give you as much quality as you think they should and that the added training time is not worth it then yeah don't use them, you'll be fine, as long as you have a great dataset and the right training parameters you'll get a great model. However again, personally in my opinion, and from what I tested, reg images increases the quality of the final model even if just by a little bit, again is it worth it for you? It's for you to decide.   \nI chose to use them personally unless I don't want to wait...simple as that",

            "selftext": "I love the memoir genre. Just so easy to read a one-off story that tells somebody's life and who they are, or at least who they want you to think they are. I've read introductions in books like Juiced or If I Did It where the ghostwriter tells the horrifying stories of trying to get their subjects like Canseco and Simpson to sit down for interviews so they could write their books for them and it being like pulling teeth. We know lugheads like Canseco or Simpson didn't sit down at their computer for one second to write those types of books, but what are some examples where you can tell the celebrity DID do the work themselves?\n\nFor all its faults I thought it seemed clear Matthew Perry did the writing himself on his tell-all. The voice was unmistakably his and filled with the types of mistakes that a professional wouldn't have put in their in the first place. Drew Carey in the introduction to his memoir Dirty Jokes and Beer mentions insisting on writing his book himself against his agent's wishes, and broadcaster Al Michaels mentions something similar about writing the book being like getting 18 root canals. The voice and familiar phrases are all so signature Al that I'm convinced the old man stubbornly did it himself. Given he wrote, \"The Audacity of Hope\" well before he was famous I think it's safe to assume Barack put in the work himself on \"Promised Land\" as well. \n\nWhat are some other exampes?",

I didn't know shit about superheroes at the time and had never seen a DC movie, but I said sure let's watch it. I didn't even like the movie all that much but I got OBSESSED with Harley Quinn. I don't know if it was the character design, or how fucking unbalanced she was, or just Margot Robbie herself, but for months afterwards I did all I could to look like her (changed my hair, copied her makeup... things like that); coincidentally, that same year I realized I was bi. I never connected the dots until recently (aka 6 freaking years later) that I never actually wanted to *be* Harley Quinn, I was just crushing on her so hard and couldn't tell the difference between that and gender envy because poor little me still thought I was fully straight lol.",

To see one of the K's who literally just appropriates WOC looks get a doll based on her when many nonwhite communities are what helped make these dolls a success...fuck it. I know it's the summer of Barbie and so Bratz must want attention at this point but this was a bad choice. This really kills that nostalgia wave they were riding.",

And I love her. But it was mainly about moving away from the Barbie image of being a white girl with beauty. I think Bratz is now just trying to market themselves as figures that look like how most woman look now. Because technically in a way, Kylie\u2019s face does look like a Bratz face. It\u2019s just that she\u2019s white and all her features are plastic, not real. If they stuck with what the brand represented years ago, it would\u2019ve been fine. \n\nBratz represented POC women that actually *have* those bodies.

Last Sunday she gave an interview on television revealing that her parents controlled her financial life (Manoela has been an actress since she was four years old), that she was only entitled to 2% of what she earned and that she had to constantly ask her parents for money , even showing an audio in which she asks her father for money to buy corn during a walk on the beach.

She took part in few reality shows in our country, such as Dancing with the Stars and she was always introduced as \"the Polish woman who made career in Bollywood\". Anyway, some journalist, who Is rather controversial, made a deep dive on his YT channel exposing her true career. In fact, her whole Bollywood career is just being an extra in two (?) movies that no one has ever heard about and the only known movie that she was in, was one of those 365 Days movies. Natalia got pissed and threatened to sue this journalist, but recently the host of one of the shows she was in basically said \"Yeah, I was aware that her career is bullshit, so I always avoided this topic when speaking to her\". Also her ex-manager just came forward saying that she is totally fake and that she was buying followers. \nI don't know what will be the result of this drama but it keeps me entertained lmao.",

Which means drugs, s*x and weird ramblings on Instagram.\n\nChristian Wolf was doing quite fine until very recently. I mean, his old rival Julian was out of the picture, his brand was doing well and his beautiful influencer girlfriend is newly pregnant (via IVF, so they clearly desired to become parents).\nBut this weekend one of his events became a desaster where people had to wait hours in line to get tap water etc. \nHe is blaming it on losing focus due to his personal life and left his pregnant girlfriend over it. More and more people coming out of the woodworks and saying how horrible he treated them. And Julian is having a field day commenting on the situation.\n\nThey both seemed like they had it all.

It\u2019s easy to buy into that heteronormative bs but it\u2019s just not true, there are plenty of ways to have very satisfying sex without penetration",
                "I'm so sorry you've been in this much pain with your flare. The Desert Harvest Aloe vera really really helped my GAG layer. I know it's expensive, but there's a reason so many on this sub are obsessed! Here's the dosing information for flares:\n\n[https://www.desertharvest.com/aloe-vera-recommended-dosage.html](https://www.desertharvest.com/aloe-vera-recommended-dosage.html)\n\nAnd the brand of dilators that reputable pelvic PTs all recommend is called Intimate Rose. This would slowly be stretching you out at home. I'm linking the page with instructions on how to use them--a too-tight pelvic floor can trap bacteria more easily and cause UTIs, so make sure you keep those dilators CLEAN when you're \"stretching\"\n\n[https://www.intimaterose.com/collections/vaginal-dilators?gad=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwwvilBhCFARIsADvYi7IU2U6FAzu66xkz6xkF70E237A4yXS4zO6qquYaJ5SnEiw-yeutnb8aAlAXEALw\\_wcB#how-to](https://www.intimaterose.com/collections/vaginal-dilators?gad=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwwvilBhCFARIsADvYi7IU2U6FAzu66xkz6xkF70E237A4yXS4zO6qquYaJ5SnEiw-yeutnb8aAlAXEALw_wcB#how-to)\n\nMy pelvic PT recommends pairing dilators with the brand of lube called Slippery Stuff, and lots of it, even if you don't think you need it, use it! they have it on amazon and other sites like CVS I bet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI want you to heal so you can enjoy your life! But I also want to say...as someone in my late 30s who works in the Industry...the girls who do go on to sleep with celebrities, very rarely leave the situation feeling good in the end. there are countless articles about musicians/actors I formerly admired, who made young \"normal\" girls feel special by \"noticing\" them, and the girls thought that of course they wanted to have sex with this beautiful genius, which probably was fun until the celebrities disappeared and they became very very depressed, felt self-harm-y, felt ghosted or used or manipulated or cast aside, were exposed to situations that left them with conflicted feelings of consent and boundaries being broken, and in the end they wished they could've gone back to these early moments and just felt the incredible ego boost of how clearly gorgeous and cool and funny and fabulous you must be!! but why don't you think of this as something you don't know the whole picture of, because you have to admit it's kind of a red flag in itself that this celebrity is messaging a fan...\n\nand maybe a very loving invisible Universe is blocking you from this for reasons unseen. please leave this situation feeling BEAUTIFUL and not broken \u2764\ufe0f",
                "Have you tried pelvic floor physical therapy?",
                "Bless, I can't blame you for feeling this way. As much as we want to say and help that sex isn't what's immediately on the table and this person should respect you for you, however this is what I would think of too. Honestly just get good at a few other things that can be mind blowing then take it from there.",
                "what hurts is the penetration or after?  We have to fix this as soon as possible",
                "I'm not trying to be a bitch but you need to take a big step back...If it really is the actual celeb in question, you don't actually know him, he is someone whose work you like and whose interviews you've seen and that is not knowing him, and I guarantee you are one of many girls he is talking to, and he is telling them all the same things.  You're not going to date him, centering your life around a not-a-possibility is 100% make your IC worse.  There's a good chance he isn't even interested in meeting the girls he's talking to, it just entertains him and strokes his ego.  If he does meet you, you will probably be discarded by him afterwards and are going to feel like shit and your IC will be worse.\n\nThat said, as for dilators, I recommend ones like these that have a tapered, smaller tip for easier insertion https://www.amazon.com/Silicone-Trainer-5-Pack-Purple/dp/B0BCM7HWHX/ref=sr_1_6?crid=IXX1WLRNRNWC&keywords=dilator&qid=1692234825&sprefix=dial%2Caps%2C454&sr=8-6",
                "I can relate to this so much. While I'm not dating a celebrity, I left a really toxic relationship and now have an amazing man. Everything is perfect, except my bladder. Which is one of the few things I would really like to be functioning properly. He's an amazing partner and lover but it completely sucks knowing that I waited this long for a good guy and this stupid f-ing disease is getting in the way!!!",
                "i dont know if this will help you. but musicians are really just people. there\u2019s hardships to having fame as well that can put a strain on the mind and any relationship he has. so he carries luggage too. try not to get lost in the hype. Also if he wants more than just emotional and he wants physical but you can\u2019t give it, he\u2019s not for you. Don\u2019t fall into the trap of low self worth if someone isn\u2019t compatible with you. You are a jigsaw piece and so is he, it\u2019s about finding if you fit together.\n\nMy boyfriend is also a professional musician and believe me there\u2019s problems that it causes. It\u2019s all fun and games for him because he gets the extra attention. But I\u2019m the one who has to hear about it and keep calm. But he also patiently understands if i can\u2019t have sex for a while. we just find other things to do, or try outercourse. There\u2019s definitely men out there who will be patient.",
                "Honestly\u2026.do other stuff with him, and tell him you don\u2019t have sex right away, even if he\u2019s a celebrity. It\u2019s perfect because it saves you and leaves him wanting more. Then you can have some time to work on your issues!",
                "Are you using pelvic floor dilators? When I was first diagnosed with IC, i was also diagnosed with PFD and was recommended to use dilators in physical therapy to help \"stretch me out\" essentially.",
                "To be honest \u2026 I\u2019d just go on a date with him and be a tease. Maybe flirt and kiss? Get comfortable with him and see if you want him to pleasure you. Because it\u2019s HIS fucking honor, not yours!!!",
                "You are NOT rotten inside \ud83d\udc96 you have so much to offer, even outside of sex! He must enjoy talking to you, thinks you\u2019re pretty AND wants to be in a relationship with you- all from who you are as a person as you are now \ud83d\udc96 It\u2019s so hard, I have vaginismus and can barely have sex so I totally understand feeling rotten inside (it\u2019s such a valid feeling) We\u2019re here for you to support you and help take that internal pressure off of you, you\u2019re doing your best \ud83d\udc96",
                "Reading more comments too- Oof I feel this so hard. I remember trying to fit a whole pelvic wand inside me when my IC was at its worst (FIRE!) You got this!

                "That sucks. Idk if you get pain from sexual stimulation in general. Just thinking there's other ways, and if someone truly likes you, they'll adapt. And sex isn't the most important factor of a relationship to everyone. Hopefully you'll have a good time with this person if you decide to meet. Wish you the best. <3",

[Here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2022/10/13/nba-spurs-starcraft-lan-photo/) provides [another image](https://i.imgur.com/V0K7SDi.jpg) and the following information:\n\n> By Noah Smith\n\n> Published October 13, 2022 at 8:34 a.m. EDT\n\n> From left to right, Tim Duncan, David Robinson, Malik Rose and Sean Elliott play \"StarCraft\" while the Larry O'Brien championship trophy sits in the aisle.\n\n> Following the Spurs\u2019 title that season, someone snapped a photo from the team plane. It remains unclear who took the photo, but it clearly shows Robinson, Rose, Hall of Famer Tim Duncan and Sean Elliot playing the video game \u201cStarCraft\u201d on their laptops. The Larry O\u2019Brien championship trophy sits in the corner of the frame.\n\n> The photo has gone viral numerous times on platforms such as Reddit and Twitter, usually with a post expressing surprise at an NBA championship team celebrating its title by nerding out on a real-time strategy game as if it was a high school AV club. By contrast, the previous season\u2019s champions, the Michael Jordan-led Chicago Bulls, appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated midseason, playing cards on the floor in the aisle of a plane. Cards were also favored by championship teams such as the 1973 New York Knicks, who played on the way home after winning it all. Other photos from NBA team planes generally show players listening to music, eating, reading and otherwise relaxing. This shot of the Spurs features a LAN party, a way for gamers in the \u201990s to interconnect computers and play head-to-head.\n\n>  \"I\u2019m used to fun on the plane, dice games, cards games, so when I got to the Spurs it was like I was in church,\u201d said Mario Elie, a three-time NBA champion who signed with the Spurs before the strike-shortened 1999 season and said he brought \u201ca little nastiness\u201d to the team. \u201cVery nice guys, shaking hands with everyone, and I sort of had to change that a little.\u201d\n\n> Rose said he played video games before joining the team in 1997, mentioning series such as Madden, The Legend of Zelda and Diablo. But he said it was Elliott, whom he called the \u201cYoda\u201d of the group, who turned him and Duncan \u2014 both rookies \u2014 on to \u201cStarCraft\u201d specifically.\n\n> \u201cWe saw him playing it with Dave Robinson, so younger players, like we do when we see older players doing something, we started doing it,\u201d Rose, who is now head of basketball operations at the NBA G League, said about himself and Duncan.\n\n> \u201cStarCraft\u201d is a science fiction, real-time strategy game made by Blizzard Entertainment. The game, originally released in 1998, has since spawned a popular sequel and several expansion packs and add-ons. The highly rated title, which centers on three distinct races battling in a distant galaxy, features a story campaign as well as several multiplayer modes, such as capture the flag, deathmatch and melee, in which players attempt to destroy one another\u2019s bases.\n\n> Asked whether he felt that the Spurs\u2019 leaders playing \u201cStarCraft,\u201d as compared with Bulls stars Jordan and Scottie Pippen playing high-stakes cards, reflected a different team culture, Rose said it could. Still, he pointed out: \u201cWhatever Jordan did, it produced results \u2014 six championships.\u201d\n\n> That\u2019s not to say \u201cStarCraft\u201d didn\u2019t have its benefits. Playing with those three teammates (the group was dubbed the \u201cIBM Gang\u201d by the rest of the team) translated into better performance on the court, according to Rose.\n\n> \u201cAnytime you spent that much time together, all together, it makes you more fond of one another and made you closer,\u201d he said.\n\n> The \u201cStarCraft\u201d sessions never got as intense, or as allegedly rich, as a Bulls card game. Still, the IBM Gang took video games seriously, especially as they began to get more competitive. Rose said the players would run back to the team bus after games to grab their laptops so they could launch right back into it.\n\n> \u201cThe games got so good we started playing at the hotel. We spent any time not on the court playing the game,\u201d Rose said.\n\n> \u201c[Robinson] was into his computers,\u201d said Andrew Gaze, another Spurs player. \u201cI didn\u2019t understand it. That wasn\u2019t my go. . . . But I was sort of envious.\u201d\n\n> Elie also said he didn\u2019t play but remembered how often the IBM Gang did.\n\n> \u201cI just remember those guys playing on every road game,\u201d Elie said. \u201cThem four guys played all the time \u2026 It was to release some tension. It was very competitive.\u201d\n\n> Elie drew a comparison between that Spurs team and the New England Patriots in terms of professionalism and leadership. \u201cIt was sort of a nerdy type of team,\u201d he said. \u201cI consider [Spurs Coach Gregg] Popovich like [Patriots Coach Bill] Belichick, just nicer. And you never had to worry where guys on that team were at night.\u201d\n\n> Gaze agreed. \u201cThat team wasn\u2019t doing things to jeopardize focus,\u201d he said.\n\n> After the Spurs beat the Knicks in Game 5 of the NBA Finals in New York, Rose recalled celebrating and partying with his teammates. But on the plane back to San Antonio, with not much else to do, they broke out their laptops and started playing.\n\n> One memory that stuck with Rose from around the moment the photo was taken was an offhand comment from Robinson, whom Rose said was one of the smartest people he ever met.",

These [changes](https://i.redd.it/zqptto18e34b1.jpg), with excessive charges for third-party app developers, threaten to stifle the accessibility of alternative Reddit apps that many users rely on.\n\nThis collective action aims to highlight the concerns of both users and moderators, emphasizing the importance of maintaining a diverse ecosystem of apps for a better Reddit experience. During this blackout period, r/pics will be set to private, temporarily restricting access to the subreddit.\n\nWe understand that this blackout may cause inconvenience, but we firmly believe that it is a necessary step to draw attention to the issues at hand. By standing together, we can amplify our voices and urge Reddit to reconsider the detrimental impact these changes may have on the broader community.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Reddit had exploded with posts and discussions about John Oliver, and he couldn't resist diving into the sea of sexually charged content that had sprung up overnight.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith his signature wit and charm, John embarked on a monologue about the peculiar fascination Redditors had developed with sharing images of him. From cleverly captioned memes to hilarious gifs, the internet was swarming with John Oliver content. Little did he know that in the audience tonight sat a devoted Redditor who had posted countless images of him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs the cameras began to roll, John addressed the audience explaining how he stumbled upon the Reddit phenomenon, discovering countless threads dedicated to analyzing his every word and gesture. The internet had become obsessed with him, and he intended to give them something worth obsessing over.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith a cheeky smile, John started exploring the various subreddits that had become his unofficial fan clubs. He clicked open the first one \u2014 /r/Pics \u2014filled with images of his most scandalous moments. The audience erupted in laughter as the snippets of him as an animated Zazu played on the screen behind him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJohn couldn't help but feel a certain thrill as he watched himself become a meme. The thought of so many strangers finding him attractive in their own unique way was oddly exhilarating. He chuckled and commented on the absurdity of it all, embracing the attention with good humor.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe segment continued, delving into the depths of Reddit's discussions. John sifted through threads where users debated the subtle nuances of his comedic timing, dissected his monologues, theorized about his double-secret workout routine, and even analyzed the way he moved his hands. He read out some of the most passionate and, at times, steamy comments that fans had posted.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe audience giggled as John recited the words, pretending to be flustered but secretly enjoying the playful admiration. The atmosphere in the studio grew warmer as the segment progressed, a mixture of laughter and a hint of something more lingering in the air.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs the camera panned across the crowd, John's eyes locked with those of a woman sitting in the front row. There was a mischievous spark in her gaze, a shared understanding of the playful tension that had built during the segment. It was as if time had frozen, and the world disappeared, leaving only the two of them. She was the epitome of beauty, with cascading waves of luscious hair and a smile that could melt hearts. She embodied the confidence and intelligence that he admired in his fans, and he couldn't resist but engage with her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Ah, I see we have a Redditor in the house,\" John quipped as he felt his impressively large  manhood quiver, his voice slightly husky with a hint of flirtation. The woman blushed and nodded, causing a ripple of laughter throughout the studio.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe remainder of the segment became a delightful exchange between John and the woman. They bantered back and forth, teasing and challenging each other's comedic prowess. The chemistry between them was palpable, a tantalizing dance of words and glances.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs the show came to an end, John bid farewell to the audience, but he couldn't shake off the connection he had formed with the mysterious Redditor. He wondered what might happen if they were to meet outside the studio, away from the public eye.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDetermined to explore this connection further, John reached out to her through a private message. He proposed meeting in a discreet location, away from the prying eyes of the internet. To his delight, she agreed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe night was sultry as they met at a quaint caf\u00e9, hidden from the chaos of the city. The air crackled with electricity as John locked eyes with the woman he had only known from afar. Her enchanting eyes held a promise of mystery and adventure.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs they sat across from each other, John found himself captivated by her every word: \u201cHi, I\u2019m Emily. Comment karma is the only karma that counts.\u201d Her voice, a soft melody that danced in his ears, spoke of desires hidden beneath layers of decorum. Their conversation effortlessly blended humor and intellect, creating a magnetic pull between them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith each passing moment, the tension grew, building a palpable longing that hung in the air. Their eyes locked in an unspoken agreement, and without a word, they left the caf\u00e9 and embarked on an escapade through the dimly lit streets.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUnderneath the moonlit sky, they wandered aimlessly, aching for a moment of stolen intimacy. Their bodies brushed against each other, the faintest of touches sending shivers down their spines. John's fingertips traced the contours of her face, his touch igniting a spark that set both their loins ablaze.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTheir lips met in a passionate collision, a crescendo of desire that had been building for far too long. Their kisses were wild and untamed, each one a symphony of longing and fulfillment. The world around them faded into oblivion as they surrendered to the throes of passion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLost in the depths of their embrace, John whispered words of adoration, his voice a velvet caress against her skin. The night became a whirlwind of stolen moments and whispered promises. They surrendered to the primal need that had drawn them together, exploring the depths of pleasure in each other's arms.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs dawn broke on the horizon, they lay entwined in each other's embrace, savoring the remnants of their stolen night. The world outside beckoned them back to reality, but the memory of their encounter would forever burn bright in their souls.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJohn Oliver had embarked on a journey that took him beyond the confines of his television persona that threatened to shake him to his muscular core.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDate nights turned to weekends. Weekends turned into getaways. Getaways quickly became months without leaving one another\u2019s side. As the years went by, John and Emily's love only grew stronger. They continued to bask in the adoration of his fans and the warmth of their affection for each other. They shared countless inside jokes, deepening their connection and strengthening the bond that held them together.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLittle did John know that beneath Emily's enchanting form, she harbored a secret\u2014a secret that would challenge the very foundation of their fairytale love story.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne fateful evening, as John and Emily strolled along the picturesque beach of his private estate, a strange occurrence took place. The tranquil waters began to ripple, and a low, guttural rumble echoed through the air. John turned to Emily, his eyes wide with a mix of curiosity and fear.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSuddenly, Emily's human facade melted away, revealing her true form\u2014a magnificent sea creature with diamond scales that shimmered under the moonlight. John's heart raced, caught between awe, arousal, and disbelief. He reached out, hesitating for only a moment before placing his trembling hand on her scaly skin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"What . . . what is this?\" John managed to whisper, his voice a mixture of shock and wonder.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEmily met his gaze with her large, soulful eyes. Her voice resonated in his mind, a gentle melody that caressed his thoughts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"John, my love,\" she began, her voice filled with a bittersweet tone. \"I am the Loch Ness Monster, drawn to your incredible spirit, your unwavering dedication to truth, and the boundless love you've shown me. In you, I found a love I never thought possible.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTears welled up in John's eyes as he listened to her words, torn between the fantastical and the reality he had come to know.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Emily, I... I don't know what to say,\" he managed to utter, his voice trembling. \"I love you, no matter what form you take, but how can we be together if you are the legendary Loch Ness Monster?\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEmily's gaze softened, a mix of sadness and understanding in her eyes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"I can choose to remain in my human form, to be with you, to share this love we've built,\" she whispered, her voice filled with a gentle determination. \"But in doing so, I would lose my true nature, my essence. And I fear, in time, that loss would erode the love we hold so dear.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJohn's heart sank as he grappled with the impossible choice before him. The love they shared was undeniable, but so were the vast differences that now stood between them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith a heavy heart, John reached out once more, his touch a mixture of longing and farewell.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Emily, my love, I cherish every moment we've shared,\" he murmured, tears streaming down his face. \"If being true to yourself means letting go of me, then I understand. But please know that our love will forever reside in my heart.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEmily, her eyes filled with a mix of love and regret, nodded in silent acknowledgment. And with a final gaze, she slipped beneath the surface of the waves, her serpentine form disappearing into the depths.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJohn stood alone on the shores, his heart heavy with a love lost but never forgotten. The memory of Emily, both as the enchanting Redditor and the majestic Loch Ness Monster, would forever be etched in his soul.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs the months went by, John\u2019s love of Emily love only intensified, defying the odds and transcending the boundaries of human and mythical creature. His passion burned with an intensity that could rival a thousand suns, a love story written in the stars.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDespite the challenges they faced, John could not deny the pull of his heart toward Emily, even in her Loch Ness Monster form. He vowed to fight for their love, for destiny had brought them together, and no force could tear them apart.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJohn had no choice. He had to go to the loch. One moonlit night, as the ethereal glow bathed the shores of Loch Ness, John ventured into the water, determined to reach Emily's magnificent presence. The cool embrace of the water clung to his muscular and taut body as he swam deeper, driven by an unrelenting desire to be reunited with his love. Each stroke of his tree trunk arms moved gallons of water and brought him that much closer to his low.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the depths of the loch, surrounded by a symphony of shimmering water and echoes of distant laughter, John's eyes caught sight of Emily's majestic form. She swam gracefully, her scales glistening like a thousand stars, while her eyes, filled with a love so profound, captivated his very soul.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTheir gazes locked, igniting a fiery connection that defied logic. In that moment, time stood still, and the world fell away, leaving only their two hearts, beating in perfect harmony. For a moment, a chiseled late-night talk show god and a prehistoric lizard from the Paleozoic era were one. John reached out, his trembling hand guided by the power of love, and Emily swam closer, her eyes brimming with adoration.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTheir lips met in a passionate kiss, a union of human and mythical, sealing their eternal bond. Emily\u2019s scaly tongue brushing against John\u2019s back molars. The waters trembled with the intensity of their love, and the moon above seemed to shine brighter, basking in their celestial love affair.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUnited against all odds, John and Emily rose to the surface, their bodies entwined as Emily supported John with her tail, their love radiating like a beacon for all to see. They emerged from the water, a vision of otherworldly romance, their love transcending the realms of human imagination.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhispers of their extraordinary love spread throughout the land, captivating the hearts of millions. Their tale became the stuff of legends, celebrated in the annals of romance as the ultimate testament to the power of love.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTogether, they danced under starlit skies, their bodies moving in perfect harmony, lost in a world where time ceased to exist. They whispered sweet nothings in each other's ears, their voices carrying promises of forever, of a love that would never waver.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs they stood on a cliff overlooking a breathtaking sunset, John held Emily close, his heart overflowing with love.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Emily, my soulmate, I am forever grateful for the love we share,\" John proclaimed, his voice filled with unwavering devotion. \"You are the missing piece of my heart, the muse that inspires my every word. Together, we are unstoppable.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEmily, her eyes shimmering with unshed tears of joy, looked deep into John's eyes. \"My love, you have unlocked the depths of my heart, revealing a love more profound than any myth. With you, I have found my true self.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd so, their love story continued, an eternal romance that defied logic and embraced the extraordinary. John Oliver, the charismatic host, and Emily, the enigmatic Loch Ness Monster, danced through life hand in hand.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYears later, sitting behind the desk of \"Last Week Tonight,\" he couldn't help but glance at the photographs on his desk. Looking past his smoldering eyes and salt and pepper haired reflection, he saw her. Her image served as a constant reminder of the extraordinary love they had shared\u2014a love that transcended the boundaries of reality and interspecies relations.",

Much like [Qatar](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/03/sports/soccer/qatar-fans-travel.html) during the World Cup, which gave away free trips to fans all over the world, but only on the condition that they would not criticize Qatar and even report any 'negative' coverage they would encounter: the regime pretends it's totally ok for women to not wear the hijab without consequences during their celebration.\n\nIran is in the midst of a huge revolutionary movement since September (the death of Mahsa Amini, who was killed for not wearing the hijab correctly). For the \"crime\" of demanding fundamental human rights, civil liberties and a democratic and secular state, Iranian protesters are shot in the eyes, genital area, breasts, kidnapped, murdered or raped by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard. Those who end up in prison do not have lawyers, and they have 15 minutes of trial (sham trials). If the conviction is \"waging war against God\" they are hanged by a crane. As prisoners, they experience other abuses against fundamental human rights such as: torture, rapes, false executions.\n\nAccording to the data collected by GAMAAN (The Group for Analyzing and Measuring Attitudes in Iran), 81% of Iranians in the country do not agree with the regime, and the percentage is 99% in the diaspora. Things that are being demanded from the West are: severing of diplomatic relations by closing the embassy, withdrawing the ambassadors; declaring the IRGC (Islamic Revolutionary Guard) as what it is: a terrorist organization (both internally and external), funding strikes and internet access, amongst other things.\n\nAlso visit r/NewIran to see this revolution in action, if you are interested!",

            "title": "Taylor Swift's private jets took 170 trips this year, landing her #1 on a new report that tracks the carbon emissions of celebrity private jets",
            "selftext": "Article: https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/kylies-17-minute-flight-has-nothing-on-the-170-trips-taylor-swifts-private-jets-took-this-year-1390083/\n\nAs the world quite literally burns and floods, it\u2019s important to remember that individualism won\u2019t really solve the climate crisis, especially compared to, say, the wholesale dismantling of the brutal grip the fossil fuel industry has on modern society. Still, there are some individuals who could probably stand to do a bit more to mitigate their carbon footprint \u2014 among them, the super-wealthy who make frequent use of carbon-spewing private jets. (And let\u2019s not even get started on yachts.)\n\nWhile private jets are used by rich folks of all kinds, their use among celebrities has come under scrutiny recently, with reports of the likes of Drake and Kylie Jenner taking flights that lasted less than 20 minutes. In response, the sustainability marketing firm Yard put together a new report using data to rank the celebrities whose private jets have flown the most so far this year \u2014 and subsequently dumped the most carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. \n\nDrake and Jenner both appear on the list, but they\u2019re actually nowhere near the top, which is occupied by none other than Taylor Swift. According to Yard, Swift\u2019s jet flew 170 times between Jan. 1 and July 19 (the window for the Yard study), totaling 22,923 minutes, or 15.9 days, in the air. That output has created estimated total flight emissions of 8,293.54 tonnes of carbon, which Yard says is 1,184.8 times more than the average person\u2019s total annual emissions. (At least one more flight can be added to that list, too: The flight-tracking Twitter account Celebrity Jets notes that Swift\u2019s plane flew today, July 29.)\n\n\u201cTaylor\u2019s jet is loaned out regularly to other individuals,\u201d a spokesperson for Swift tells Rolling Stone. \u201cTo attribute most or all of these trips to her is blatantly incorrect.\u201d\n\nTo create this report, Yard scraped data from Celebrity Jets, which in turn pulls its info from ADS-B Exchange (\u201cthe world\u2019s largest public source of unfiltered flight data,\u201d according to its website). Yard based its carbon emissions estimates on a U.K. Department for Transportation estimate that a plane traveling at about 850 km/hour gives off 134 kg of CO2 per hour; that 134 kg estimate was multiplied with both time-spent-in-air and a factor of 2.7 to account for \u201cradiative forcing,\u201d which includes other harmful emissions such as nitrous oxide (2.7 was taken from Mark Lynas\u2019 book Carbon Counter). That number was then divided by 1000 to convert to tonnes. \n\nComing in behind Swift\u2019s plane on Yard\u2019s list was an aircraft belonging to boxer Floyd Mayweather, which emitted an estimated 7076.8 tonnes of CO2 from 177 flights so far this year (one of those flights lasted just 10 minutes). Coming in at number three on the list was Jay-Z, though his placement does come with a caveat: The data pulled for Jay is tied to the Puma Jet, a Gulfstream GV that Jay \u2014 the creative director for Puma \u2014 reportedly convinced the sneaker giant to purchase as a perk for the athletes it endorses.\n\nWhile Jay-Z is not the only person flying on the Puma Jet, a rep for Yard said, \u201cWe attributed the jet to Jay-Z on this occasion because he requested the Puma jet as part of his sign-up deal to become the creative director of Puma basketball. The Puma jet\u2019s tail numbers are N444SC at Jay-Z\u2019s request. N, the standard US private jet registration code, 444, referring to his album of the same name and SC for his birth name, Shawn Carter. Without Jay-Z, this jet would cease to exist.\u201d\n\nThe rest of the celebrities in Yard\u2019s top 10 do appear to own the jets that provided the flight data for the report. To that end, though, it\u2019s impossible to say if the specific owners are the ones traveling on these planes for every specific flight. For instance, Swift actually has two planes that CelebJets tracks, and obviously, she can\u2019t be using both at once.\n\nSo, beyond the Jay-Z/the Puma Jet, next on Yard\u2019s list is former baseball star Alex Rodriguez\u2019s plane, which racked up 106 flights and emitted 5,342.7 tonnes of CO2. And rounding out the top five is a jet belonging to country star Blake Shelton, which has so far taken 111 flights and emitted 4495 tonnes of CO2. The rest of the Top 10 includes jets belonging to director Steven Spielberg (61 flights, 4,465 tonnes), Kim Kardashian (57 flights, 4268.5 tonnes), Mark Wahlberg (101 flights, 3772.85 tones), Oprah Winfrey (68 flights, 3493.17 tonnes), and Travis Scott (54 flights, 3033.3 tonnes). \n\nReps for the other nine celebrities in the top 10 of Yard\u2019s list did not immediately return Rolling Stone\u2019s request for comment. \n\nAs for the two celebs who helped inspire Yard\u2019s study: Kylie Jenner\u2019s jet landed all the way down at number 19 (64 flights, 1682.7 tonnes), sandwiched between Jim Carey and Tom Cruise. And Drake\u2019s plane popped up at number 16 (37 flights, 1844.09 tonnes), in between golfer Jack Nicklaus and Kenny Chesney. While Jenner has yet to address her 17-minute flight, Drake did respond to some criticism on Instagram by noting that nobody was even on the seven-minute, 12-minute, and 14-minute flights his Boeing 767 took during a six-week span. The explanation, in all honesty, doesn\u2019t do him any favors.\n\n\u201cThis is just them moving planes to whatever airport they are being stored at for anyone who was interested in the logistics\u2026 nobody takes that flight,\u201d Drake said. (A rep for Drake did not immediately return Rolling Stone\u2019s request for further comment.)",

I have two in mind. \n\n1) [JLo's](https://imgur.com/a/cg9KQd4) career flourished by playing the late Selena Quintanilla in the 1997 film.\n\n2) [Leo Dicaprio](https://imgur.com/a/zJDj0AW) was not James Cameron's first choice for Jack Dawson in Titanic; River Phoenix was! Unfortunately, River died in 1993, years before production began. Would Leo have the status he has today had he not been Titanic?",

We don\u2019t know if River would\u2019ve been interested in Titanic even if he was Cameron\u2019s first choice, and there\u2019s also a chance Cameron would\u2019ve felt he was too old by the time filming took place. We do know River would\u2019ve taken Leo\u2019s roles in The Basketball Diaries and Total Eclipse so that might\u2019ve slowed him down but likely not too much, he was still an Oscar nominee at that point. If River does end up as Jack for Titanic then Leo likely ends up doing Boogie Nights, which he turned down to do Titanic and suggested Wahlberg for the role. So he would\u2019ve gotten a different role that might not be as popular but still critically acclaimed and still likely leads to his collaborations with Scorsese and such. Likely, he may not be the same level of superstar he is now but still ends up as a very celebrated actor and we also get to have another great actor in River Phoenix to celebrate. \n\nI think the more interesting actor in wondering what happens if River Phoenix was still alive is Joaquin. Not necessarily because Joaquin would\u2019ve been up for the same roles and would\u2019ve lost out to River but because I don\u2019t know if he would\u2019ve been the same actor without that tragedy in his life. He was with River when he died and was such a young age(he turned 19 a couple days prior), and something so tragic happening completely changes you as a person that idk if I can imagine him being the same actor. And to go back to your question, idk if that necessarily boosted his career but his career would certainly be different if River was still alive.",

Cameron could have changed his mind, Phoenix could have had a scheduling conflict and chosen a competing film, Cameron and Phoenix might've not worked well together, Phoenix might've had too many demands or been too distracted from the project and performance, etc. Lots of things happen with big stars on Hollywood sets all the time where actors that the director initially wants doesn't end up becoming the person chosen. Now if any of that happened would Cameron still find DiCaprio, that is certainly an open question, but I did want to clarify that Phoenix surviving the 90s does not garuntee that he would replace DiCaprio in Titanic (1999)",

I was in a super similar situation as you, I played a showcase and afterwards wound up talking with another artist in attendance who was pretty successful and someone I really was excited to get the chance to talk to. Then I see my (then) boyfriend come walking over and I just wanted to disappear into the floor. I had this sense of dread knowing my chance to talk to this other artist was about to be over. Lo and behold the bf starts chatting it up I basically stood there and watched them have a conversation, with my numbskull ex interjecting his stupid anecdotes/talking about himself after everything the other guy was saying. Afterwards I told him that I didn't appreciate that he did that, and that I'd been really excited to talk to this guy and maybe pick his brain about the industry and stuff. My ex replied, \"but I thought I did ok, he and I both talked about 50/50.\" and I had to tell him, no, you actually talked about 90%, and actually I wanted it to be 50/50, but with ME as the other 50! This night wasn't about you! He actually thought them sharing the conversation 50/50 was ok and didn't consider me at all.\n\nANYWAY, my rant is a bit different from your story because my ex was just an idiot who refused to work on himself, and your ex seems to be an actually bad person. My point is, I should have broken up with him when I felt myself wanting to melt into the floor that day, and when he didn't understand why what he'd done was wrong.

If she doesn't get it, you need to really think about if she is really that great a partner.",

She was looking at this like a girlfriend-relationship event, but it was actually you being at a work event. She has to learn how to be an insider in the life of a performing artist or this isn't going to work out.",

I suggest you take a good, long look at other situations you have dealt with and see if you recognize any other red flags. I suspect there are, but only you can answer this. I wish you the best with both, your music and your personal life.",

Neither of you really thought through the other person's position, feelings or expectations.",
                "I think you did great tbh. It was your moment of fame and you were kind enough to wanting to include her in it as well after you got the solo photo you deserved. She however showed you her true colors in front of everyone.",

                "She was in the wrong, even if you were doing something bad (which you weren't) she shouldn't throw a fit about it in public, it's something you have a discussion with your partner about.\n\nSpeaking of, make sure you talk about this with her. If she's normally nice and supportive, something else may be going on with her, or she may just be showing her true colours. Either way, communication",
                "No, the talent and win is yours. She has been supportive true but you probably have best mate that has too. She should have been supportive once again and not said anything to lessen this huge accomplishment by you.

                "Personally, if I saw a photo of an artist with some smaller artist artist and their gf, the presence of the gf would have precisely zero impact on whether I check out their music or not. However, if I then heard this story, I'd make sure to never listen to the smaller artist's music. Unless you're one of musicians who tries to maintain the illusion of singledom (which is disrespectful af to partners imo), no one in the music industry would give a solitary fuck about your gf being in the photo.\n\nYou were wrong for having childish expectations and excluding your gf for no reason, she was wrong for trying to hurt and embarrass you in return. Both immature.",
                "Of you weren\u2019t an artist yourself this would have been a dick move but having the photo as a promo opportunity is useful and it would look ridiculous if someone had their gf in a promo photo\n\nBut don\u2019t overblow it. Her feelings are somewhat understandable. It\u2019s just one of those things. Both need to let it slide",
                "Yes. She is buying you shit so you can succeed. You need to pay the piper. You sound ungrateful.",

                "A good partner doesn't let their own ego fuck with their partner's career. You're make smart, professional decisions, and she's jealous because she isn't getting the attention that you earned.\n\nShe sounds like she's worried you're too good for her and are going to realize it, and is following through by demonstrating that you are.",

                "NTA. She tried to embarrass you and make you look like a scrub in front of someone who\u2019s an important figure to you. A rule in my relationship is to NEVER embarrass the other in public. It\u2019s grounds for the automatic ending of the relationship because it shows an extreme lack of respect for the other. Some people will wait until they feel like they have a certain kind of power (financial, a baby, marriage) over you before taking off the mask. Like, if my partner had the chance to meet the Suicide Boys and take a pic I honestly would care less about being in the pic first and would get as many pics of them together as possible. I\u2019m 25f and can\u2019t fathom acting like that. I know you\u2019re tired of hearing it, but be aware of y\u2019all\u2019s age gap. And look up DV stats for same-sex couples. A screaming match will never be a healthy form of communication.",

It\u2019s a cool moment/memory she\u2019d like to share and remember but you\u2019re ego has you worked up about your potential career. That\u2019s lame if even if you want your career to be a rockstar. Maybe worse because of the unlikelihood of success. \n\nAnd if having a love one who seems on your \u201cteam\u201d of well wishers and helpers in a pic makes you worried about missing your big shot, edit her out and then come here and ask if you\u2019re the asshole then.",

He must have eventually felt trapped by Kim\u2019s pathological need to be photographed and admired independently of him, no matter what, even when he was having a mental health crisis.\n\nEven during these final \u201cdivorce talks\u201d she hired paparazzi to take \u201ccandid\u201d pictures to make herself look sympathetic. These were released with stories like: \u201cKim the long suffering wife trying her best to help kanye\u201d \nClassic collab pmk x tmz.\n\nIt\u2019s the same with Pete Davidson how when she felt the relationship ending she brought a camera crew/ paps to Australia to ambush him. Probably with the goal of \u201clet\u2019s pretend we\u2019re doing perfect\u201d but also \u201cif he\u2019s going to break up with me fine I\u2019m going to film it so I will look sympathetic\u201d\n\nEventually they realize the true relationship is between Kim and the cameras and they are secondary. \n\nThey are there to give Kim something to react to, that she can disseminate to all her followers who will give her the massive amount of admiration she needs like oxygen.\n\nEven if the partner himself is giving her admiration, it\u2019s not enough unless everyone else can see her being admired. \nIt\u2019s the same with her kids which is going to become an issue. Just loving her as a mom isn\u2019t enough.  Kim needs the extra layer of the cameras/social media to make sure everyone knows they love her.",

                "NOTICE  how the paps positioned their camera to show Kim\u2019s distressed face cry face  and notice how the only pics that were \u201cleaked\u201d are ones that show Kanye have a fist like he is angry.",

It just makes many believe he self sabotaged to get TF away from everyone and the insane control. \nShe can have all the tears she wants too, but her narrative is slipping and people are starting to see the real issue and having sympathy for Kanye. \nMakes you wonder why he was SO well respected in every field of work and called kind and humbled person and then within the last year (2 years) he\u2019s was labelled as a racist lunatic\u2026 it more than likely was Kim and Kris!",

The show ran for four years. It has since ended, but rather than leave the industry behind again, she appears to be back for the long-term. According to IMDb, she is on a show on Nickelodeon. She also hosts a new podcast with her former *Full House* co-star Jodie Sweetin. \n\nAre there any other instances of public figures leaving their area of expertise entirely for an extended period and then returning? I know there are celebrities that choose to be more private, or that have up and down careers, but I\u2019m honestly not sure I can think of a public figure that went away for as long as Barber did, and then came back.",

I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.\n\nThe girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like \u201cSir, you need to pay for those first.\u201d At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.\n\nWhen she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually \u201cto prevent any electrical infetterence,\u201d and then turned around and winked at me. I don\u2019t even think that\u2019s a word.\n\nAfter she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.",

I hope you find a way to add any beauty you need after your surgery  <3",

The band has also performed for members of the military and their families to entertain troops and raise money for disabled veterans\n\nThen there is the Gary Sinise foundation Snowball Express:\n\nThe holidays can be especially challenging for grieving families. Each December, we host a five-day experience for 1,750+ children of the fallen and the surviving spouse/guardian. With special time to honor their fallen and a blend of fun entertainment and inspiring programs, these families can lean on their peers for support.

I'm not itching to buy stuff I don't have a use for, but if you show me a cute jacket that has a nice half zip and pockets I'm getting tempted.\n\nBut if there's someone who's like me out there who is following people who are actively out there trying to sell stuff, and they are tempted by more types of objects that line up with what their celebrity is selling them, they're not stupid they're just incredibly vulnerable to those tactics. And especially when you think about how strong advertising is in our current time, and it being made to try and target base human reactions, they're just getting hit by an industry",

They haven't necessarily thought deeply about which things are beneficial for them to focus their emotions on. So they focus their emotions on what media tell them to. They don't hold themselves back from those emotions and that can result in pathology.\n\nSimilarly, when they see something pretty that is presented as attractive, they get excited, don't regulate their emotions, and they buy it.

Not only can they afford all the Botox, fillers and surgeries (along with professionals that tell them what to get in order to attain beauty), they can afford the best skin care and dermatologists telling them what skin care services to use and products to get for them. They have the best makeup artists as well who perform on prime skin. Unless you have that kind of money and time, even realistic photos like these aren't that realistic for plebs like us, and we need to be okay with that.\n\nI have rosacea. Not as bad as my mother or sister, but I have a noticeable pale spot on my cheek amongst the redness that unless treated by a dermatologist and covered in colour corrector, full coverage foundation and concealer, is going to be noticeable. If my face was on Kendall Jenner, it would be unnoticeable by virtue of her money and time. But, that's okay!

You can see that, underneath all that makeup, they have pock marks, blackheads, pimples, and so on that they're trying to cover up--and failing under scrutiny. I feel the wrinkles look even worse when covered that heavily.\n\nI get blackheads on my nose/chin/forehead every so often because of large pores and overproduction of sebum, but I never wear makeup. It only exacerbates the issue and makes it look even more obvious, especially this close. I use a facial lance and exfoliate, and for the most part it gets rid of them, when it happens.\n\nThankfully, I've never had an issue with acne, but when I get breakouts, I get them bad (face, shoulders, back, chest even at 30 y/o). I just suck it up and deal with a red face while the inflammation goes down over a week or so. It is what it is.",
