            "title": "A neighbor goes up to my house in her pjs and sits right next to my room to talk over her cellphone. I started blasting music right next to the window she talks at",
            "selftext": "So a bit of context: I live in an apartment complex which is huge - 53 buildings, 6 floors each, 4 apartments each floor. We\u2019ve all got common spaces to walk, hang out, work out and walk our pets. \n\nI\u2019ve been living here with my girlfriend and our dog for a year and a half in a first floor apartment, and just recently, about a couple days ago this woman walks up with her phone at night, in her pjs, and just has the longest conversations right outside our bedroom. \n\nIt happens around 8-9 and she\u2019s there for quite some time. Yesterday I just pulled the blinds open, looked at her and closed them back. She didn\u2019t move until she was done. Today, when I got home from work I saw she was already there so I took my speaker and set it as loudly as possible right next to the window she sits at. I went to bed with my girlfriend around 10:30-11:00 and she wasn\u2019t there anymore, but couldn\u2019t check if the speaker thing worked or not in an immediate manner. \n\nI fully know it\u2019s petty as hell to do so, mainly because I don\u2019t see any argument as to why would she have to leave. Right outside our apartment isn\u2019t part of our apartment and it\u2019s a shared space with the whole community, although I find it wildly annoying. I don\u2019t think if I were to file a complaint that it would be successful at all. So I\u2019ve chosen pettiness. I\u2019ve also though of putting large plants and pots on that specific place, or just wetting the floor vastly so she won\u2019t be able to sit. What would you guys do? Thanks and if successful I\u2019ll keep you posted.\n\n\nEdit: this got way more attention than I thought! Thanks everyone! I\u2019ve gotten mostly hilarious responses and some surprisingly insightful ones that I\u2019ve taken into account. I\u2019ll update tonight on my approach if you\u2019re interested! Thanks again. \n\nEdit 2: I CAME HOME, SHE WAS THERE AGAIN!! \n\nOk, so when I got home she was there againnn! I walked up to her and said \u2018excuse me, hi. Would you mind moving your conversation please? My girlfriend and I can hear you and you\u2019re right next to our bedroom window. She just stared back at me. Didn\u2019t say a word. I think I said back \u2018hello?\u2019 And she replied \u2018okay. I\u2019ll leave now\u2019 to which I said thank you, smiled and happily went home to tell my girlfriend about it. Couple mins later, heard something and lo and behold she hadn\u2019t moved an inch. So I opened my window and told her that I\u2019d asked her nicely already and that we could hear her conversation. She replied angrily, saying that she wasn\u2019t even speaking! She also said that she was free to be there as it was a public space. We went back and forth and I always ended up saying that we could hear her and that we requested she move cause it was annoying. She then turned her head away from me and appeared to be crying. We were both silent for what seemed like an eternity and then she stood up and left. I said thank you and went back to tell my girlfriend who was already upset too, as was my dog that barked the whole time we had the conversation. \n\nSo there you go, guys. I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t do anything petty haha, I\u2019ll still keep the suggestions in my back pocket cause they were all absolutely hilarious and I have a slight suspicion she might be back tomorrow.",

            "selftext": "I (15F) live together with my parents and my two older brothers (23 and 25). Both my brothers are disabled and have the mental age of around 4 or 5. Because of that my parents are pretty much always solely focusing on them. Sometimes a bit too much I think, because they have forgotten my birthday multiple times and holidays are always planned for my brothers, leaving me with nothing to do. For example going to this specialised farm-like camp for people with disabilities where everything is supervised so parents and children can both relax. But there's nothing for me to do there so I am always bored whenever we go to such a place.\n\nBut I can usually deal with it, because my parents allowed me to follow piano and violin lessons so that's kind of my getaway instead. I have been taking piano lessons since I was 4 and violin lessons since I was 7. I really really enjoy music and playing and want to have a career in music later.\n\nBut last week they told me they were going to cancel my lessons. Because they need me to look after my brothers for a few evenings a week. I got really upset because those lessons are basically the only thing that I felt was for me, and not for my brothers, and now I'm going to lose them because my parents need a babysitter.\n\nThey told me they know it's not ideal, but it's difficult for my brothers and they just need extra care. I blew up on my parents telling them that I need care too and that they never considered me with whatever they plan, only my brothers. My parents got upset with me and told me I'm being childish and unfair because my brothers can't do anything alone so it's normal to go the extra mile for them.\n\nAITA here?\n\nEdit: I didn't expect this to get so much attention. I expected maybe getting two or three replies. Thank you so much for your replies and advice and encouragement! It's a bit overwhelming and comforting to know that I'm not alone and not being unreasonable. \n\nI actually tried to talk with my parents about this again last night, but it kind of turned into a lot of yelling again because I got so frustrated because I felt like they weren't taking me seriously. I tried to tell them calmly how important music is for me and that I can't take care of my brothers but it felt like they brushed me off so I got mad. They were saying things like family should always be number one and that we all have to do things we don't like, and that we all have to sacrifice things, and that life is unfair but we can't do anything except deal with it.\n\nI think I will take some advice I read here today and try to print out an article about this and leave it on the table. I'm also going to find a way to earn my own money so maybe I can start my lessons again myself. But I'm not really sure how to do that yet. And someone mentioned to look into getting a scholarship for college later so I'm going to do that too because now I'm not sure anymore if my parents would pay for me to go to college.\n\nThank you so much again for all responses!",

She posted in r/AmItheAsshole\n\n**Mood Spoiler:** >!things are moving in the right direction!<\n\n**Original** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/158y7ki/aita_for_sleeping_in_the_guest_bedroom_after_my/)**: July 24, 2023**\n\nMy husband has started working night shifts (8PM - 3AM) over two months ago and has since been using our en-suite bathroom for showers after work. This would have been okay but he plays loud music through the bluetooth speakers and claims he needs it to wind down.\n\nI\u2019ve asked him repeatedly to use the shower downstairs and have even set it up for him with the same products he has in our en-suite. I\u2019ve been using the bathroom downstairs every morning so I don\u2019t disturb him while getting ready for work but he refuses to do the same.\n\nSince I\u2019m a light sleeper and after being sleep deprived for so long I decided to sleep in the guest bedroom yesterday. He claims I\u2019m being petty and should talk to him about this as opposed to sleeping in the guest room. The thing is I have tried talking to him about it but I usually don\u2019t bring up the discussion as / when it\u2019s happening and prefer to do it the next day after work so I\u2019m not upset and can have a rational discussion.\n\nHe\u2019s been going around telling our family and friends and they all think I\u2019m being petty. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m doing something wrong / how else to go about dealing with the situation. I need to know if AITA.\n\nSorry for any typos / formatting \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc my brain refuses to function when I haven\u2019t had enough sleep! \n\n***Relevant Comments:***\n\n*Wtf is he telling his friends and family that they're on his side?*\n\n\"I haven\u2019t gotten the whole story tbh, but they are all focusing on me not sleeping in our bedroom. Apparently this turns it into an argument / fight? I\u2019ve gotten messages from a couple of mutual friends and family members but haven\u2019t responded yet.\"\n\n*Is this new behavior?*\n\n\"The funny thing is he use be really quite and considerate in the mornings when he started work earlier than me. Idk why he\u2019s having difficulties replicating after work.\"\n\n*Does he usually run to his family/friends with things like this?*\n\n\"There\u2019s only been a couple of instances (2) that I can think of when he has discussed things with his family / friends. Suppose that\u2019s what he uses as an outlet. I do this too with people I identify as my support system (to get advice / let my feelings out). That being said no one has ever confronted or made direct comments to him.\"\n\n*One more from OOP:*\n\n\"No, fortunately he\u2019s really considerate in general. This is the first this he\u2019s acted like this. I initially thought he was acting out because he\u2019s a morning person and is rarely up at that hour by choice. His family usually tends to side with him but I have a feeling our friends don\u2019t know the whole story. I haven\u2019t responded to their messages yet, I like some part of my life to be private (I do see the irony in saying this after posting on reddit for everyone to judge).\"\n\n***OOP is voted NTA***\n\n**Update (Same Post): July 25, 2023 (Next Day)**\n\nUPDATE: to the kind people of reddit, thank you so much for all you suggestions! I love my husband but sometimes being petty pays off. Sorry for the long post!\n\nI started the morning at 5:30 with a quick run on the treadmill (our home gym is right next to our bedroom. Thank you thedartofwar for the idea!). This poor guy woke up and practically ran into the room thinking someone\u2019s trying to break in. He looked TERRIFIED!\n\nHe was confused / concerned as opposed to angry when he was questioning what I\u2019m doing and if everything is okay. I told him I\u2019m too tired due to lack of sleep and didn\u2019t want to drive to my spin class. I thought it\u2019s a good idea to have a quick workout at home to wake me up and stimulate endorphins. Either he was stunned into silence or was too tired to put up a fight; it took him a while to ask how long I planned on working out for. I said 45 minutes and didn\u2019t catch the response he mumbled as he was leaving.\n\nI finished my workout at 6:15 and had a smoothie hoping he\u2019d fall asleep (if he hasn\u2019t already) before hopping into the shower and carrying out phase two.\n\nWith doors locked and the volume set to what I guess he usually listens to music on I put my playlist to work (I now realise that you can\u2019t really hear the music with the speakers outside the shower unless the volume is relatively high).\n\n30 seconds in to the first song plays (Awaken by Dethklok, thank you Jackisntasquirrel!) I hear knocking on the door. I figured I could use the music and shower as an excuse to claim I didn\u2019t hear it later! This increased to banging calling out to me by the second song (So you die by bloodbath, thank you drfstich!) and by the third song (die mf die by Dope thank you Horror-Commission656) there was complete silence. I think he only stuck around for so long since heating up another room might have taken a while. Thank you for everyone for the music suggestion, I wish he stayed for the whole playlist \ud83d\ude05\n\nBy the time I\u2019m out of the shower our bedroom is empty. I found him watching TV downstairs.\n\nHe asked me why I would do this when I know he\u2019s just finished a long shift and hasn\u2019t had any sleep. told him I thought it was acceptable since he does the same thing. Like most commenters pointed out, the whole situation shows lack of care and I was curious why he doesn\u2019t care and what caused him to change so drastically because he usually isn\u2019t like this.\n\nAfter a lot of pushing he finally admits that he likes our conversations after work and figured if I was up, we would talk. ( I don\u2019t understand how this is the thought process of a grown man). He claims he didn\u2019t realise it was an issue for me because I haven\u2019t been as angry about it (here I was thinking the situation required patience and understanding\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f). I also realised he\u2019s still grieving his grandmother\u2019s death (she passed away in April). They use to talk on a daily basis is and he hasn\u2019t fully accepted the loss and processed it in a healthy manner. He\u2019s open to the idea of getting therapy to process the grief. I don\u2019t think this excuses his behaviour but it does explain a lot.\n\nGetting back to the showering at 3am; we\u2019ve agreed on the following;\n\nhe will use the shower downstairs after working night shifts.\n\nIf he wants to use our shared bathroom (it has a jacuzzi) he will text me before I go to bed and I\u2019ll sleep in the guest bedroom\n\nI realised I was pretty much doing this to myself after the first week. I have learnt that I don\u2019t owe anyone comfort at the expense of my well-being and shouldn\u2019t have let it go on for so long. Yes, he\u2019s immature and childish but I\u2019m hoping we can work on it together.\n\nThank you to everyone for their suggestions and concern! I understand all couples face challenges, these incidents in isolation doesn\u2019t necessarily paint an accurate picture of their relationship. Like I mentioned in the comments he\u2019s been very considerate and loving expect for a few isolated incidents (less than 5) during the 7 years I\u2019ve known him. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s reasonable to expect someone to be perfect 100% of the time (I feel the need to point out that no one should use this statement to stay in an abusive or unhappy relationship!).\n\nIf you\u2019ve made it this far, I appreciate you! Apologies for the long post but I\u2019m lowkey proud that the pettiness paid off. sorry for any typos, I\u2019m still sleep deprived but looking forward to a good night\u2019s sleep tonight.",

Alternatively \"this is wild, how did you reach this conclusion and think it was ok to message me about?\"\n\nGrief is an awful thing, but it still doesn't fully explain this behaviour. Talking to family and friends when you're uncertain about something is fine imo, as it gives you the opportunity to get a different perspective before making a decision to go into something all guns blasing.

We also have a dog. with the dog we traded off who woke up at 7am to feed and walk her. When I got up to take care of the dog I also took care of the cat, Husband didn't. So I stopped taking care of the dog. on the thrid day of him having to wake up at 7am, he asked why I was no longer taking care of the dog.

It feels like he wanted OP to basically yell and scream at him to stop for him to realize he should stop, which shouldn't be a thing.

I geeked out hardest when Space Truckin' was a stand because that is my favorite Deep Purple song.  Purple Haze is a top for me.  Doggystyle is close to the top as well.  Worst for me is California King Bed only because it was the first music reference in the entire series that I had to look up.",

Araki usually only included the most famous of all rock music/music in general, so it's hard to just claim that some are the worst and others are the best.

                "The best I'd say is 20th Century Boy and Soul Sacrifice (the yellow temperance localised name to those curious(  \n\n\nThe worst I would say is Whitesnake, Limp Bizkit (I know its a cliche but fuck Fred Durst and Nu Metal in general) and Nellyville",

Violet had already used her Palisman, Bubbles, to banish the bubbles that Lara was slipping on earlier and that the pair created earlier.*\n\nLara: *pants a little from the slipping but regains her composure.* \u201cAs I was saying, I\u2026 I\u2026\u201d \n\n*She starts swaying a bit in place and plays with the hair covering her left eye a bit. She suddenly begins to eerily glow with an unfamiliar kind of magic a little and shudders before moving the hair covering her left eye to cover the right one. It reveals that her left eye is cyan colored.*\n\n*As soon her left eye was visible and the glow had faded, her demeanor completely changed from tsundere to shy and timid. Her blush grew brighter as she spoke in a much more gentler yet wavering tone.*\n\nLara: *shaking a bit in nerves* \u201cW-Well I figured\u2026 just be-because we\u2019re rivals d-doesn\u2019t\u2026 I w-wanted to\u2026\u201d *whines a little and tears up before shoving a box into Azura\u2019s arms before bolting off* \u201cHAPPYBIRTHDAY!\u201d\n\n*Before Azura could inquire further, she was already gone. She looked to her cousins and Caitlyn, but they were just as dumbfounded. She looked at the box and with a curiosity, opened it. She gasped a little and her eyes gleamed with wonder at what was inside.*\n\nAzura: \u201cIs that\u2026?\u201d\n\nIvy: \u201cwhat is it?\u201d\n\n*Azura reached into the box and pulled out a bluish cyan colored crystal with a cord connected to it, making it a necklace. Ivy recognized it.*\n\nIvy: \u201chey\u2026 isn\u2019t that-?\u201d\n\nAzura: \u201cPascal\u2019s Prism.\u201d\n\n*in the box was indeed the crystal Pascal from Coven Quest III used. \u201cA Replica\u201d Azura wondered as she held it from it\u2019s points with her thumb and index finger. She stared at it with wonderous gleamy eyes. It glowed a bit and grew comfortably warm to the touch.*\n\nViolet: \u201cdoes it work?\u201d\n\n*Azura moved the index finger of her other hand to touch its side. Right as it made contact, the crystal began to glow blue and orange with a twinkle of power. It was\u2026 genuine.*",

                "TDE is washed up. Artists can't drop every 4 years anymore and I've been saying this for years.  The game for the last 12 years has been all about momentum and the long periods between albums have killed the momentum of every artist on TDE except for Kendrick Lamar and SZA.",
                "Yikes, that was uncomfortable. Both handled it well though.\n\nTbh, there's truth in both of what they're saying. REASON definitely ain't lying when it comes to TDE holding back artists from dropping (SZA also spoke out multiple times on this). But at the same time, the hosts (and most fans) not being able to name 10 REASON songs is valid (and wild af).",
                "Someone some day is going to make a documentary about TDE and it\u2019s going to be delicious",
                "TDE is a poverty label. All they do is delay their artists' albums by years at a time and give them no promoton then blame them for lack of streams. No wonder Kendrick left.",
                "That was embarrassing for the president of the label to hop on and insult their own artist.       \n\n But also hhh acts like TDE the only label that fucks up their artist's potential. Look at Dreamville, Cozz, Bas, Lute all not big artists. Look at GOOD Music with Desiigner. Look at how Shady records signed all the Griselda guys and messed that up. No label perfectly markets all their artists.",
                "TDE has no direction and it seems like everyone is disgruntled including the executives",
                "saying Ray Vaughn got more motion then REASON is out of pocket. not saying he's bad but he hasn't dropped anything better than REASON imo.",
                "This dude is the new head of TDE correct? So he\u2019s trashing his own artist that they\u2019re failing to market?\n\nDidn\u2019t see the full context but Reason is a solid rapper. He\u2019s always had good features on Dreamville projects. As an artist he\u2019s quite bland but clearly TDE has fallen off massively on its roster. \n\nPeople talk about Ray Vaughn but has he been marketed well? Doechii is the only big new artist and that\u2019s solely because of her deal with RCA (same as SZA and SiR).\n\nSo this dude basically is admitting his label sucks at promoting artists",
                "TDE fall from grace so disappointing man, and publicly at that",
                "TDE is really such a dysfunctional label man. I have said for years that they are basically just purely lucky for finding such talent. Because they are dog shit at promoting their artists or putting out albums in a timely manner. What has TDE even done that other labels couldnt do with similar talent?",
                "It was very interesting watching this play out live. With livestreams becoming more and more popular, a lot of game is indirectly being given for free. Its what you say and what you don't say.",

                "This was really embarrassing, and yeshiva only like one reason verse on Seasons, but he didn't deserve that, yeah he's not picking up steam and the album is really random but to try to humiliate another black man like that, bruh, tde ain't all that and its been like that for a while, he had such great chemistry with dream ville so maybe....",
                "Fucking TDE is a joke. Feel for reason here, he\u2019s actually talented as fuck.",
                "Whewwwww why Top Dog son do that?! \n\nTDE done fell apart, Kendrick got out at the right time, everything can\u2019t last forever, reminds me of Rocafella.",
                "I've never seen this from any label. I feel for reason cuz this is mad disrespectful man. Who would wanna be on a label where the leaders move like that? I'm sure if this wasn't A live podcast it would've been worse reaction",
                "I think it\u2019s unacceptable he\u2019s clowning his own artist but in all fairness reason is such a bland one dimensional rapper. He literally has nothing unique about his personality or rapping style and I\u2019m suprised tde would even sign him in the first place with the talented roster they had.",
                "LISTEN TO WINDOWS CRY BY REASON, he called this years ago",
                "I\u2019ve tried holding onto TDE and their position as a label over the last 3 years, thinking they\u2019d be alright, with Kendrick gone and what not. Even when SZA & Punch were bumping heads about releasing music, I just saw it as little disagreements that they\u2019d resolve in under 24 hours and they\u2019d be cool again. But this is just **WEIRD!** For your own label boss to do you like BruceDropEmOff did DDG is CRAZY, and to air out Dave Free and Kendrick\u2019s opinions on Reason like that as well\u2026\n\nIt\u2019d be easy to look at this argument as staged promo for Reason\u2019s upcoming album, and if so, this just lame cos they look embarrassing. But if it\u2019s for real, this might be the one that finally shows the cracks within TDE for me.",

                "Moosa sounds like a fucking clown.",
                "This is fucked up.  If the label has a problem with the artist handle that shit in a more professional and discreet matter.  Its not like this shit is good promo for the album, Reason is going to do Reason numbers regardless (which isnt much), so why put him on blast in front of the whole world to see?  I hope he can leave the label because to be stuck there after this would be some bs",
                "As much as I don't think the label is nowhere near as bad as everyone is making it out be in these comments, this is completely ridiculous and Top should hit his son up and talk to him about not messing with business like this. \n\nStill worthy to say, no, TDE has not fumbled its artists. SZA is still one of the biggest artists in the world and got there through an album the label had to force out. Isaiah went through personal troubles between the release of his 3 albums and the label backed him through all of that. Same about Soul. Rock, Q and Sir are just taking their time. Rock is soon releasing his album. \n\nUsing this Reason situation to start this whole argument again is hilarious because y'all also never respected him as an artist. His music just doesn't resonate with people and that's really it. I hope this changes by this next release",

                "They also removed his album trailer from YouTube.",
                "I am not a business person, but this seems like not a wise business decision.\n\nTime to start looking for a new label.",

A lot of people have even referenced \u201cI can see you\u201d as an example of a song with clear queer undertones. \n\nThere are also some ambiguous ones like the reference to \u201chairpin drop\u201d in Right Where You Left Me from evermore (which can be argued means a silence so quiet, but also is a way of letting other people know you\u2019re queer). It\u2019s really interesting to see how she\u2019s worked these nuances into her songs which makes them relatable to a larger cross-section of people. It\u2019s no wonder her music is so popular, and it\u2019s been particularly interesting to see how a lot of her music doesn\u2019t use pronouns.\n\nWhat are some of the queer themes you\u2019ve noticed in her music? \n\nNote to mods: This is not a speculation on her sexuality, just commentary on how her music could be interpreted by some.",

Plus she makes it sound more dramatic for entertainment. I think that's the case with I Can See You, she's clearly is fantasizing about a guard.\n\nThe wig... I'll give you that. BUT, keep in mind lots of girlies who identify as bi were never even with a woman lol. I work in a school as a therapist and ALL the girls are bi, but none of the boys are.

            "selftext": "Before you say anything, let me be clear that I love Taylor Swift\u2019s music and her music videos. I\u2019ve been a fan since Debut and I\u2019m always ready to watch any of her videos, new and old. \n\nMy main issue is that she seems more focused on the Easter eggs of it all rather than the actual storytelling that music videos are known for. For example, the \u201cI Can See You\u201d music video is basically ALL Easter eggs and not much of a story that\u2019s even relevant to the vibe of the song. \n\nI know fans love to Easter egg hunt in her videos and sleuth out what Taylor might be hinting at next, but it feels like (to me) the Easter eggs take away from the present and have you itching for what\u2019s next. I\u2019m not trying to shame anybody for doing so or enjoying the journey of doing it. \n\nHer old videos were simple in that they told the story of the song (i.e. \u201cLove Story\u201d, \u201cWildest Dreams\u201d). Seems like ever since Reputation she\u2019s been making videos that allude to what\u2019s in the future for her career or whatever\u2019s going on with anyone in relation to her career.\n\nI guess one could argue that she\u2019s now telling the story of her career. And maybe other artists have done this as well, but I\u2019m only aware of Taylor doing it since she\u2019s so famous. I just wish it was less \u201clook at this and that and what meaning it has\u201d and more \u201chere\u2019s the story\u201d. \n\nI know this is definitely going to be unpopular, but does anyone else think the same?",

                "I think this is what bothered me about the Karma music video. I wanted a fun, cohesive  video about karma that matched the lyrics and what we got was a bunch of weird unrelated scenes cut together. I did enjoy Bejewelled though, where she seemed to strike a good balance between Easter eggs and storytelling\u2026",
                "Honestly, I'd say it's the fans that have ruined the experience of watching a music video. Ever since the re-recording journey began (I'd actually argue as far back as evermore, as two surprise drops made EVERYONE start paying attention and scrutinizing things real fast), fans have constantly been digging for Easter Eggs in every facet of her career. A vast majority of her fanbase have made it clear that's what they want: Easter Eggs to know when the next thing is gonna drop. I think as a result, Taylor has leaned into that because she knows fans like it and will watch it.\n\nI anticipate that once the re-recording process is done, she'll do less Easter Eggy stuff. But honestly, we did this to ourselves. I remember when the theory thread was rampant with constant unhinged theories at the beginning of 2021. It was bad. Lots of people in this subreddit were not a fan of the constant theorizing. But tons of people were. Taylor has made it clear she pays attention (or at least her team does and informs her) to the online landscape and what fans are talking about. Tiktok, Twitter, and this sub (although the sub is a lot better now) were constantly pushing for easter eggs. So she did what everyone one wanted and put them in her music videos.\n\nTaylor is just catering to the fanbase that wants the easter eggs. We only have ourselves to blame lol.\n\nEDIT: Wording\n\nEDIT 2: wow didn\u2019t expect this to blow up. Thank you for the awards and comments! Easter eggs can be a divisive topic in this community so happy to see it unite some of us!\n\nEdit 3: want to clarify that I know Easter eggs have been around for a while and go way back. I would argue that the fandom did not start going rampant with constant theories and Easter egg hunting to an extreme degree (5 holes in the fence being an outlier) until Taylor did her two surprise albums. After that there was a noticeable shift in this subreddit in terms of how often theorizing was happening (it was constant) and how in demand people were to know the next step. There was active outrage when she wasn\u2019t announcing her re-recordings \u201cquick enough\u201d after Fearless TV dropped and there were accusations that she was leading fans on. It has since calmed down greatly but 2021 was very aggressive in terms of constant fan demand for Easter eggs and clues into her next album. \n\nAnyway thanks again for all the upvotes! Love this community!",
                "Tbh I think the classic music video is dead. They\u2019re now just visuals so that artists can post the song on YouTube.",
                "Generally I get what you mean, but there are some exceptions. All Too Well was up there for storytelling in music videos, definitely followed a storyline there. I Bet You Think About Me also had a story that was in line with the song.",
                "At the end of the day, I always love watching Taylor's videos because the production-value alone is insane and, if nothing else, they're stunning to watch. I do think Anti-Hero told the story of the song well, same with I Bet You Think About Me and the All Too Well Short Film. \n\nThe I Can See You video is clearly taken from the lines \"And I can see you being my addiction / You can see me as a secret mission / Hide away and I will start behaving myself\". It's a small part of the song and the video is definitely meant to represent the Speak Now vault tracks more than anything, but it still tells the story of the song through a metaphor. :)",
                "There isn\u2019t much money in MVs anymore other than to drive interest in the artist and their upcoming projects.  YouTube pays out 2k dollars per million views or so I heard. Other than Flowers this year, most MVs aren\u2019t pulling a ton of views. Vampire has 36m for example and it\u2019s the big first single for Olivia. So the videos are usually done on the cheap unless you have someone like Taylor who\u2019s willing to take a loss making them as fan service. \n\nBy loading them with Easter eggs she is encouraging fans to watch them multiple times. In addition, the press will write articles about the Easter eggs for a week or two which will drive engagement further. Without the Easter eggs, the story dies quickly. So expect it to continue.",

Easter eggs are supposed to exist on the edge so you have to go looking for them, when she centers them it kind of ruins the purpose of the video.  \n\nBejeweled kind of gets away with it more because the Cinderella story fits the song so well, Easter eggs could be a bit more natural-the elevator, the castle, Speak Now instrumentals all fit the vibe really well.",
                "I really don\u2019t look for the easter eggs during my first view. My first time I\u2019m just gonna enjoy the video for what it is.",
                "Interesting, because I totally agree with your general idea but think ICSY was the best of her self-directed since Folkmore - the storyline was coherent and cohesive in a way a lot of her videos aren't IMO. And while the story of the music video doesn't match the lyrics, I think it *does* match the production of the song. It gives off very secret agent/mission vibes to me, personally.\n\nBejeweled and Karma, meanwhile, are fun but super random and shoehorn a ton of Easter eggs into them for no reason. I get that it's probably entertaining for her to do with the re-recordings, but I think she'd be better served developing her storytelling skills in a visual media.",
                "hiding easter eggs is one of her favorite things to do. if that\u2019s what makes making music videos enjoyable for her I don\u2019t really care tbh. Lavender Haze was pretty \u201cclean\u201d in terms of easter eggs. also music videos are not as popular anymore as let\u2019s say 10-15 years ago. most of the people watch on tiktok etc but not on Youtube. the fact that she\u2019s still putting out music videos for a lot of songs, in contrary to other artists releasing new music, is already quite exceptional.",
                "I\u2019ve never once stopped and looked for Easter eggs. I just watch and enjoy. And videos don\u2019t really need to tell the story of the song. Billie Jean by Michael Jackson was just him dancing.",
                "Have you looked at other music videos besides hers? Music videos don\u2019t always tell the story of the song, as a matter of fact they rarely do anymore and it\u2019s not just her",
                "I've been a fan a long time but have tried to stay away from the Fandom as much as possible (until now, I guess). I only just recently learned Easter eggs were a thing, but still don't bother knowing more. I just want to listen to her music!\n\nI watched the I Can See You video from that perspective, as someone who had no idea I was supposed to be looking for clues or anything, and saw a video about a heist mission of her album being rescued. I think it was a fine enough video. I think you've possibly ruined her music videos for yourself with how deeply you let yourself get wrapped into the fandom culture.",
                "I mean looking at \u201cthis and that and what meaning it has\u201d is quite literally how you look at art. She makes art. It\u2019s the way she wants to tell her story. It\u2019s a cohesive art piece where everything is something and it all ties together.",
                "I feel like it\u2019s the fans! Taylor breathes and immediately there are a bunch of Tik Toks and a reddit threads explaining how it\u2019s an Easter egg for a new album coming out tonight.\n\nAny new Taylor content I get, I take it as face value and just enjoy it. It\u2019s exhausting trying to decipher every millisecond.",
                "I find it so annoying. When she does ANYTHING fans are like omg it must mean this or this, 1989 TV IS COMING. Like stop. Enjoy being in the now. We\u2019re in her Eras era and I think that\u2019s super fun on its own.",
                "I STRONGLY disagree that the music video for I Can See You doesn\u2019t match the vibe of the song. It\u2019s obviously not telling the story that the lyrics tell, but I thought that song gave off major heist vibes in general, and I really enjoyed the story within the video. And I prefer a cohesive storyline overall over random stylized scenes like the Karma music video has.",
                "I enjoy a lot of her older videos, but saying she\u2019s \u201cruined the experience\u201d of watching music videos is, tbqh a bit dramatic. They\u2019re her songs and her videos that she\u2019s directing and likely (at least partially) funding. You don\u2019t have to watch them. And I agree that she\u2019s looking at what a lot of her fans want, and giving it to them. A lot of her fans are right around her own age, and frankly, we don\u2019t have time to sit around and watch videos over and over. We watch them when they come out, have fun picking out the Easter eggs and other fun visuals, and then maybe we\u2019ll watch another time or two later. That\u2019s it.\n\nPersonally, I think it\u2019s pretty cool that we\u2019ve watched her go from her early videos (especially from Debut) where they were such generic videos, into these videos where she\u2019s directing, casting people who she genuinely wants representing her music and having the freedom to put as many (or as few) Easter eggs as she wants!",
                "I agree with you wholeheartedly. It's one of my biggest issues with Taylor directing her own music videos and one of the reasons I think her views are so low (I know views are down for everybody, but she still should be doing better).",
                "I never think of Easter eggs when watching and I find the music videos very enjoyable:)",
                "I think the problem is the fans trying to dissect every minute detail as an Easter egg. She puts Easter eggs in plain sight. Stop trying to create complex equations to prove your theory right.",
                "Her music videos are the only ones that I return to over and over. There are very few other MVs from other artists that I have watched more than a few times \n\n\nI liked Karma because it involves many interesting themes, and I loved seeing her tour dancers featured in it as well. Having people in the MV that are relevant to the time the video is made is good narrative as well. Just like ICSY MV.",
                "Can't relate. Tons of artists make music videos that seem to have nothing to do with the music. At least hers aren't all jiving and shaking barely covered.",
                "I made another comment about why I think you\u2019re feeling this way, but I also wanted to say that the I can see you music video made me interpret the song in a different way that I certainly wouldn\u2019t have before. I think the song is obviously about the sexual tension you have with someone you\u2019re not supposed to but \u201cup against a wall with me\u201d now makes me think of 2 spies Charlie\u2019s angel posing against a wall as to not get caught by whoever lol. I think this particular MV adds a fun twist to the song.",
                "Definitely not as unpopular as you might think. For me, 1989 was peak music video era with Blank Space, Style, Wildest Dream and Out of the Woods all having beautiful visuals and telling the story of the song, or (in the case of Style and OOTW) having a really cool vibe that captures the essence of the song. When she started the Easter eggs with LWYMMD, it was pretty fun trying to catch all the references but what started off as a clever wink became very \"Look at this, guess what this means!\" \n\nCertainly this is not true with all MVs since Rep (All Too Well: The Very Long Music Video tells the story beautifully), but too many. And I Can See You is the worst of them all because the song itself is full of lusty lyrics that could have led to a provocative video, but instead it was all \"Taylor's in a vault,\" \"Look at all the dresses,\" \"Hey my ex-boyfriend and a banjo.\" So disappointed. I hope any new 1989 MVs have the vibe of the originals.",
                "You're lucky you weren't watching videos in the early 80s. None of the images matched the song and there were no easter eggs.",
                "I disagree that she isn\u2019t storytelling in her recent videos. Anti-Hero, Lavender Haze, Bejeweled are all similar to short films in their storytelling.\n\nI Can See You is the closest thing we\u2019ve gotten to pure fan service in a while. I think she strikes a balance, but people definitely take it too far dissecting every music video frame and social media post.",
                "There are (at least) two ways a music video can be written: 1. It can visually show the story that is told in the song or 2. It can match the vibes. Taylor has some of both. Lavender Haze and Anti-Hero were pretty literal, while I Can See You was DEFINITELY a vibes song. The day it dropped I listened to it and said \u201cthis song sounds\u2026 sneaky?\u201d Then lo and behold, the next day I watch a whole video about a bank heist to go along with it. Both are valid music video styles, but may not always suit your tastes",
                "I agree so much. I hate that the music videos are just Easter egg hunts now, so much that I\u2019ve only watched all of her newest music videos once but I still go back and rewatch earlier ones. 1989 era was the peak, high quality music videos that told the stories of the songs without being endless Easter egg hunts. The I Can See You music video is imo her worst so far because it has absolutely nothing to do with the song, doesn\u2019t fit the vibe at all and is solely Easter eggs/this one very specific moment in Taylor\u2019s career. Music videos are one of the only things I genuinely think have gone downhill in Taylor\u2019s career, which is sad bc I know they have the potential to be good",

                "You: Since Reputation \n\nMe: Delicate, Lover, The Man (still had a cohesive storyline), cardigan, willow, IBYTAM, ATW, Lavender Haze (more of an artistic MV but still), Bejeweled\n\n???",
                "Honestly it\u2019s the only reason I watch them. I\u2019m not a big music video person, and I can\u2019t even say I\u2019ve seen most of her music videos\u2026 I get your point though. Sometimes a music video should just be a video to accompany a song",
                "So, I think there has already been commentary about how the fans have contributed to her putting all the Easter eggs in the videos. I agree with that. She is leaning into what fans are wanting and expecting. However, I propose possibly two other reasons to add. \n\nThe first is that I notice that as artists go longer into their career (say past a decade), they tend to have more videos that include concepts or alternative stories. They have established themselves so now they are challenging themselves and can afford to experiment more. I think Taylor as she loves directing, is also in the is phase which is why we are getting less of the straight storytelling. \n\nSecond, I think genre might (thinking out loud here) be a factor. With country for example I notice that a lot of those videos tend to have more concrete storytelling which is why I think I Bet You Think About Me and ATW leaned into that. But for genres like rock, some types of pop and indie we get videos that might not be related at all or are very conceptual. I think as Taylor works in more genres we are getting more types of conceptual videos and Easter eggs that you might see in those genres.",
                "Here\u2019s my unpopular opinion: I don\u2019t like and rarely watch music videos for anyone.",
                "The storytelling in Anti-Hero shows us Taylor's more vulnerable side. I genuinely believe it's one of her best Music Videos, imo.\n\nThis video also gets bonus points because my 5 year old loves seeing a gigantic Taylor haha.",
                "The fans ruin it. They usually do. I can see you is a cute video, especially using OG speak now characteristics in it, but the song doesn\u2019t match at all. If anything, that video should have been just a trailer or something in place of the vault scramble we never got. Otherwise, the only Easter egg that\u2019s really in it is on the bridge that says 89. And I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with a fun little nod at what\u2019s probably next. The fans definitely take everything too far in the example of Taylor\u2019s curly hair in I can see you could be an Easter egg for debut. When like \u2026 no \u2026. She had curly curly hair for three eras. It doesn\u2019t mean anything. \n\nOther examples of this are that wall in the man music video \ud83d\ude11",
                "her 1989 & rep videos can never be topped.",
                "I couldn't agree more and it'd be so bad if you get hate by other fans just for saying this but it's totally true. Lately her videos had been terrible especially the Midnights videos. I didn't like any of the Midnights music videos but not just because of easter eggs but also for the masive abuse of CGI. I didn't get to watch Midnights videos more than once and I don't feel like rewatching them again.",
                "Idk why but her newer music videos feel kind of cheap. Especially the ones from Midnights, the I can see you vid is the best one compared to the other ones since midnight released",
                "I don't like any midnight videos because they are just a giant easteregg hunt. It's Ike she sacrificed the quality of the video for the Easter eggs. I just want a quality video with no Easter eggs. It would be funny to see the swiftie lose their mind trying to find something not there.",
                "Agree as much as I wanna support her directing,  her best videos have been story boarded by her and directed by someone else eg LWYMMD and Blank Space. I guess she\u2019s still learning",
                "I feel like Easter Eggs in general have become exhausting. Most the time they are wrong and knowing just ruins the surprise. I thought like the elevators in bejeweled was a cute little hint but everything past that is madness.",
                "I feel like her music videos are suffering the same fate as her lead singles had. The singles previously were purposely misleading and divisive, so the fans started thinking that they will be the weakest songs in every album. Similarly, the music videos features Easter eggs so all fans see are the Easter eggs rather than the plot. I thought Karma didn't make any sense until someone pointed out that it had Greek mythology symbolism. And now, it is my favourite from the Midnights era. I realised that I have to see the music videos from a non-fan point of view.\n\nI personally now think she's exploring more genres and styles. I am glad that she steps out of her comfort zone a lot. We got her debut album after she wrote 150 songs. She needs more time experience as a director and I believe she's fully utilizing the rerecordings era for it. Some of them are a bit awkward sometimes in their execution, but I am excited to see the improvements each time!",
                "All the music videos have plots  completely separate from the Easter eggs. Maybe the problem is you can\u2019t separate that? I like both so I\u2019m good.",
                "I just watch them and don\u2019t pay attention to the Easter eggs, because I\u2019m just not that invested. Stuff will come out when it comes out. They\u2019re still good music videos regardless.",
                "Idk I feel like she mixes it up quite a bit. I felt that lavender haze and bejeweled are pretty straightforward. And anti hero is also very literal. I like the way she does things.",
                "I kind of agree. While I enjoy the Easter eggs, my fav videos of hers (besides LWYMMD which I think is just her best for a million reasons) are the ones that tell the story of the song, such as Lover or IBYTAM, even Willow",
                "I 100% get what you\u2019re saying, personally I liked I Can See You but I will concede that it doesn\u2019t really fit the song topic. Also things like Karma and Bejeweled were frustrating because it did feels like Easter Egg fodder. I think the most recent TS video that really captured what I love about her videos is Lavender Haze, it was a story and a vibe that really fit Midnights and was enjoyable to watch",
                "I think with the exception of delicate and maybe lwymmd everything with and post reputation have been bad with YNTCD being the worst",
                "Honestly, I feel like she\u2019s kinda always been this way. It\u2019s people who get too crazy about it who ruin everything",
                "I definitely think you bring up a good point. But I for one watch the video multiple times. Just to experience and also to focus on Easter eggs. So probably smart on her part because you get multiple streams \ud83e\udd23",
                "Tbh I\u2019m not a fan of regular music videos \ud83d\ude05 to me they\u2019re boring and pointless, so I enjoy how hers are a bit more fun with clues and stuff!! She\u2019s literally the only music videos I watch",
                "I Can See You had a very cohesive storyline, so I'm really confused when I see this statement. The song is about a forbidden love locked away in her mind, just like how she (and her record) were locked in the vault.\n\nI would say Karma is the most disappointing music video she's released recently. It had nothing to do with the song and honestly the Ice Spice feature was distracting and ruined the vibe of that track.",
                "I absolutely ignored all Easter eggs beyond the cast of I Can See You. I am not a detective. It's not mandatory to look for all the secrets.",
                "i remember in college my friends and i would just sit and replay the blank space music video, maybe watch some of her older videos, go back to blank space, rinse and repeat. I don't do that with any of her more recent videos! I'm sick of all the cgi!",
                "I think I Can See You would have been a better music video if it followed the plot of the song rather than cramming as many Easter eggs in it as possible. She could have thrown an Easter egg in at the end with someone's locker being 1989 or something.",
                "Some of y\u2019all spend too much time online, respectfully ![img](emote|t5_2rlwe|1065)",
                "Agree and disagree. When I first watched \u201cI Cann See You,\u201d I was a bit confused by this sultry song with a heist video. But this is not the first video of hers that I\u2019ve been confused between the song and visuals (I still have NO idea how Style\u2019s music video links to the song. Love both song and video but what is happening\u2026.) I personally don\u2019t love Karma\u2019s music video, although I like the concept and the imagery, having Ice Spice felt very random and contextually wrong at the time. \n\nBut I would say since Reputation she\u2019s had a mix of videos that are Easter egg like and are telling the story of the song. Delicate, ME!, Lover, Cardigan, Willow, All Too Well, IBYTAM are more focussed on the storytelling aspect. Yes, they also have their own Easter eggs but I think that\u2019s just part of Taylor\u2019s brand, ever since she had the messages hidden in the lyrics. \n\nI think part of the thought process is what is Taylor\u2019s brand right now? I know Swifties don\u2019t love to hear it but she is a brand that is crafted. It\u2019s key to her success because she is capable of connecting with her fans and translating images/music into something people love. 1989 was a time where she was trying to prove she is beyond the tabloid gossip about her relationships. I think Wildest Dreams was her only \u201cromantic\u201d video despite Style and OOTW also being about romance. Blank Space was completely satirical, SIO is addressing her critics, OOTW represents her own personal growth and Bad Blood was about her \u201cgirl squad\u201d, a concept she went hard for during this time (as much as I dislike the term). \n\nI would say her brand right now is all about owning her music and being unashamed of her career. The whole concept of Midnights, the Eras tour, it all comes back to her musical journey. So it would make sense all of the media she releases now comes back to this idea. She knows her fans loveeee digging for Easter eggs and she\u2019s leaning into it hard. \n\nI\u2019m betting once Era\u2019s tour is over and her re-recording journey is over, her music videos will become less Easter egg-like. She has proven herself extremely capable of crafting her music videos to what messages she wants to convey.",
                "I haven\u2019t watched a music video for any artist in years but I\u2019m definitely with you on being tired of Easter eggs being way too present in everything. Like, not everything has to be wink-wink nod-nod. Ridiculous",
                "It doesn't bother me a lot, but I really wish the Midnights videos were simply *Midnights* promo, and didn't feed speculation about her next step",
                "I have realised more recently that not just Taylor but a lot of musicians and even actors/actresses/directors have been creating content that's \"what the fans asked for.\" In Taylor's case, she knows we love Easter Eggs so she'll throw in Easter Eggs. With videos like Bejewelled and I Can See You, videos where she's said these are \"for the fans specifically\" she's giving us what we've told her we want. Which is why your opinion is unpopular, because there are a minority of us who appreciate what she's doing but maybe don't care as much about the Easter Eggs or the hints at future endeavours or references to the current state of her career and would rather have a music video more reminiscent of her older styles.\n\nPersonally I loved Bejewelled because she balanced the Easter Eggs with the theme of the song. I also loved the concept for I Can See You but I think I would've liked it more if the whole song matched the visuals. But Karma was just forgetful; it was visually pleasing and nothing much more sadly.",
                "The discussions on her music and videos are hard to get into or enjoy as they tend to focus so heavily on a neurotic examination of every little possibility of a sign, math equation, color combo, etc. It's stressful! I don't know if that's her fault or fans' fault for taking it too far but it's really missing the point for me.",
                "I mean, yes, the I Can See You mv doesn't match the lyrics (it matches the vibe tho), but it's in the only video where this happens, I think. Bejeweled and Karma both match a lot (even if karma it's a bit weird), also anti-hero and Lavender Haze. Yes, there's a lot of easter eggs, but at the end of the day, there's only one video of what you can say that. We should wait to see what happens from now on. Say that as a generalization is a bit of an exaggeration. I do understand the feeling tho",
                "I feel like her Easter eggs should be looked at as a game of eye spy where no  literary/visual analysis is needed. The reputation plane/lover sign in the Me! Music video / the vault scramble game she did/ the karma with all of the albums around it because scooters karma is Taylor re recording her albums/colors for referencing old/new eras/albums. I feel like tik tok has taken this Easter egg thing and wore it out because they\u2019re doing these really analysis videos where you have to jump through hoops to get and they\u2019ve NEVER been that deep/serious.",
                "I\u2019m gonna get hate for this but most music videos are just so bad. They have nothing to do with the actual song lyrics and it drives me nuts. Isn\u2019t the whole point of a music video to depict the story of the song?",
                "i love the music video for I Can See You, but I do wish she took that same video and and put it for Vigilante Shit or Long Live (band of thieves in ripped up jeans would\u2019ve been cool). I didn\u2019t like how irrelevant the lyrics are to what\u2019s happening in the video.",
                "IMO her main growing issue is that she doesn\u2019t do subtle in any visual media capacity: directing, acting, performing. I want her to focus on her craft only. Her older videos had experienced directors, and now she\u2019s directing her own and compounding the letdown of the MV with her star power: the audio. She cannot do subtle and subtlety is why visual media works: if you don\u2019t get it, you follow along and if you get it, it\u2019s rewarding. You don\u2019t get \u00ab\u00a0talked down to\u00a0\u00bb and you don\u2019t feel ignorant when you miss something. And now she\u2019s working on a series, I really don\u2019t want her to take a leap forward w/ the eras tour and then four steps back w/ the criticism. Maybe then we\u2019ll get a reputation 2.0 idk",
                "Yup. I ....dislike her music videos as of late. The last one I really liked was Blank Space. Too much sfx and no storytelling in terms of the song itself. Her music videos have become so bland. Like I'll watch it one time and never think about it ever again. Easter eggs are fine, but too much of it takes away the fun from actually finding it. Tell me a story, make me think of it. I don't want hints and inside jokes that only fans get.",
                "Definitely an unpopular opinion and I hope it stays that way",
                "I hope the following makes sense, I may or may not have written it after cooking with Canna butter.\n\nThis also may be an, \"unpopular opinion,\" but I think we have to remember is that sometimes we can think of a public figure as static in time. We can freeze the timeframe what we, as a fan, thinks they should always represent, feel like, sound like, or what kind of product they produce for us to consume especially if they have any sort of longevity. I feel it also especially holds true for those who became famous when they were in their teens or younger. Taylor has had a lot of growth between Debut and The Eras Tour/Speak Now (TV).\n\nHowever, one thing has always remained the same, even in her fictitious subjects of the folklore/evermore Era, she always writes about her experience, what's going on in her life, and what she as a person is dealing with. Her experience in life as a person on this blue marble since she has started being involved in songs released into the wild has (in a grotesquely broad sense) changed from crushes, first dates, high school homeroom, football games, homecoming, and traditional fairy tale, \"happily ever after,\" thoughts through times of extreme anxiety over fearing that fans are actually boo-ing you at a time when you're getting #1 most played songs on the radio, going through trauma, handling what it's like to have paparazzi make it so you can't leave your house, finally letting go and bringing some folks to her house for fun only to be burnt and go into exile, be actually criticized by some people when she came back, into a phase where she starts getting comfortable with herself, who she is as a person both in terms of how her past has formed her and who she is in the world, and finally learning how to take control over how things play out. (Wow that was really rambling). Of course she's going to write her videos about fame, other celebrities, what's coming next. It's what she's surrounded by at this point in her life.\n\nAs far as the particular video for \"I Can See You,\" if that song really is about John Mayer as I have heard some theorize, I don't blame her for not doing something super sexy or on-theme for it.\n\nNow, as far as why Taylor has ruined other music videos for ME is that the woman is the definition of brilliance in her writing, storytelling, set visions, and actual ability to tell any sort of story in her videos. Everything else is just so shallow in comparison.\n\nYes, she does have a couple of videos that are HEAVILY/COMPLETELY ABOUT the Easter Eggs and/or what's coming next, but even those do HAVE an overall theme or story that is heads and shoulders above any other set of music videos out there.",
                "It sounds like you don\u2019t like it because it feels like you\u2019re always watching an ad for something new. And I have found with some of the various things I enjoy online, once I start to figure out their ad tricks and how they get me, it starts to just feel annoying. I don\u2019t share the sentiment, but I don\u2019t watch videos much either.",
                "I understand this, but I can't help but think she was kinda forced into it. A) people were hunting for Easter eggs in them even when there weren't any, and B) if she doesn't make them about her career and the next release, they'll go back to sleuthing out her personal details (correct or otherwise) from whatever story she tells. Making her mvs so career-focused is a surefire way to keep people from gossiping as much about her dating history",
                "Not as unpopular as you think.  I've had same opinion for a long time myself",
                "i think of it more as: she doesn\u2019t directly communicate with us that much anymore (secret sessions, meet and greets, interviews) so this is more just a way for her to give us something to uncover and talk about. i truly enjoy coming here after each release to see what people caught that i missed.",
                "Her music videos don\u2019t match up with her songs anymore and not in a fun way. I loooooved her earlier music videos. I\u2019d watch them before school on vh1 while I got ready for school. I\u2019d leave late for something like Love Story or even You Belong With Me tbh. \n\nShe\u2019s heavily focused on making the video share a narrative she can\u2019t just come out and say-the Easter eggs. But she\u2019s also heavily focused on charting vs bring proud of her music. It\u2019s very different from her early in her career, or at least noticeable now.",
                "i think easter eggs have kind of taken over the whole experience of enjoying taylor swift, no shade to fans who like them, i do find them fun myself, but in the earlier days seemingly (by earlier days honestly i think i just mean before the eras tour and midnights) there was one or two easter eggs every so often so that it wasn\u2019t glaringly obvious whatever the easter egg was pointing to but a few people could work it out, but now it seems like there\u2019s a new easter egg every five seconds and people are analysing so so hard (a pretty obvious example is the \u201clover deluxe version\u201d everyone was so hyped and was sure was gonna happen, but even the holes in the fence from lover is another example) where you can\u2019t even enjoy the thing anymore, you simply must analyse it. i feel like she is oversaturating the market with easter eggs to the point where there are so many conflicting ones and half are probably just fan made, i like the fun of it all but i wish in general there were less easter eggs because it just really takes the fun out of it. like an an interview they said i think from memory it was about the bejeweled video but maybe it was karma that they had like a 12 page document just for outlining all the easter eggs in the video. i feel like i\u2019m doing more work in analysing than i am in my english degree. i get that it\u2019s a bunch of fun and i\u2019m not trying to tuck anyone\u2019s yum but i feel personally it would be way more fun if it was stuff that took a while to find/workout and they weren\u2019t just obvious things that are like this is the exact date that 1989 is coming and whatever else.",
                "I mean her popularity has sky rocketed since reputation too what ever she is doing must be working\n\nI honestly think the change in her MVs have more to do with her desire to self-direct and experiment with that, than her desire to put Easter eggs everywhere....\n\nthe Easter eggs honestly drive a lot of hype in her fan base, and during a time that she doesnt really talk to us outside of concerts that much... its like her fun way of talking to us, and honestly makes us most tight knit as a fan base",
                "i love the i can see you MV BUT had their been a video based on the lyrics .... that would have been one hot video esp if lautner starred in it as well lol",
                "I totally agree with you :') As a relatively new sweetie who doesn't hunt for Easter eggs in her videos, sometimes the message can be totally confusing. Like Delicate (one of my favorite songs) the vid's message was about taylor's take on her reputation while the lyrics were about someone she likes and how her reputation could affect their relationship. At least the delicate vid alluded a little to the song lyrics :') however karma and I can see you were totally weird and I couldn't grasp how the video related lmaoo \ud83d\ude2d",
                "I thought this when I saw the bejeweled and I can see you vids. I love her concepts and creativity level, but at the same time I didn't follow the story or listen properly to the music because I was bombarded with Easter eggs. When you compare it to something like ATW10 vid, they don't hold up in the same way in terms of storytelling. But hey, it's her work and like I said, she's still a great director.",
                "idk taylor has done both easter egg-heavy videos (midnights and lover) and story-based videos (red tv and folkmore) in the past few years. let's let her have fun with the easter eggs because we know that she's still capable of giving us symbolic and deep music videos every now and then",
                "I think thats what bothered me about Karma, and to an extent Bejeweled, but I Can See You was kind of perfect.",
                "I also love her and her music so much but somehow i enjoy the MVs from LWYMMD backwards, esp Ours, Begin Again, Blank Space, Style. (which both vibes and story telling fit the songs so well)\n\nMaybe it's how i grew memory with her songs in the past, now I always start with Spotify/Youtube lyric video.",
                "I got distracted in the Bad Blood video by all the cameos and trying to figure out where I had seen them before.",
                "Antihero and bejeweled are her best directed ones as of recent because they have a story that connects to the song imo\n\nLavender haze and karma are very ? \nKarma at least had some very cute visuals to match the lyrics but for the most part there wasn\u2019t a story \n\nThe man was great too, it\u2019s the first one she directed after all(I think)\n\nI wouldn\u2019t go as far as to say she\u2019s ruined them because it\u2019s not that serious but so far I don\u2019t love all her directed mvs\n\nI would say pre I can see you, her fault seemed to be adding too much dialogue for some odd reason\n\nTaylor has had some great music videos come out with Easter eggs like me, lover and recently I would say I bet you think about me",
                "I feel like it depends on how you watch the video and how much online you are. Also, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a translation/ meaning (mu first language is spanish) but I feel a lot of people took the \u201cEaster egg\u201d and made it less special. I think she uses Easter eggs as a way of telling her story because is all part of one thing. Not because she\u2019s more famous, but more because she has A LOT of her own story to tell. We Swifties are well aware of the story, but she still has to deal with a lot of things behind close doors and music videos maybe are part of her way to show it. \nFor me the difference is for example, all the Speak Now things in the \u201cI see you\u201d video, I don\u2019t take that as an Easter egg, it\u2019s just part of the story of the video, it\u2019s literally saying \u201chey, all this thing we had, it\u2019s not ours anymore\u201d but the \u201c1989 tv\u201d at the end is the real Easter egg. Or the Anti-Hero video with the ghost dressed inspired by her are the fun things that gives another meaning if you notice, but even if you don\u2019t, you can enjoy anyway. \nI turned my sister in law into a swiftie like, 6 months ago and she went and watched every video and for her the first time watching was really fun and enjoyed the visuals and storytelling with fresh eyes, and once she started watching again, she caught up with the references and Easter eggs and found it so fun and amazing. And she asked me about a lot of them and was amazed by how much Taylor thinks about things. \nThat\u2019s why I think the whole experience of watching her videos depends on you. If you want to see the story, you can. It\u2019s there. But if you are also online a lot, you\u2019ll find a lot of people dissecting every single frame. I think Taylor makes videos for both those fans (I say this as someone who saw the Karma vid once and that was enough for me, I just saw a fun thing and that\u2019s it)",
                "lol thats stupid and so are you",
                "I think for me, it's more she's ruined the watching of **her** music videos because of all the easter eggs I may or may not pick up on because I honestly just don't care (but that said, I've enjoyed a good majority of them lately--Anti-Hero, IBYTAM, ATWTMV, I Can See You--but I'm also not looking hard for a deeper meaning into things). I just watched the new Tyler Childers' one and it was very beautiful and touching, and not for one second was I looking for easter eggs in it. Same with the new Olivia Rodrigo one.",
                "I agree. I\u2019m just so tired of how far the Easter eggs have gone in general. It used to be a fun thing, but now fans look at how many times Taylor has breathed in 30 seconds to see if she\u2019s hinting anything through her breath.",
                "She is the Marvel Cinematic Universe of pop music videos.\n\nAlways setting up future events and pandering with fanfare but hardly executing the story being told *now*. Before you know it, you watch 7 music videos and find yourself wondering \"where is any of this going???\"",

                "I hadn't thought about this but maybe this explains why my favorite of her latest mvs has by far been the 'I bet you think about me' video",
                "I\u2019ve actually always been bothered by how even when there is a loose plot, her videos are mostly about her looking cute in as many costume/scene changes as possible. Lady, limit yourself to 3-5 outfits!!!",
                "i kind of agree dont get me wrong easter eggs are fun but i feel like fans now think every single thing she posts or anything she says is a hint and it kinda takes away from the present",
                "Honestly, I Bet You Think About Me is the only recent music video I've liked. Debut through Rep the music videos were gold imo",
                "I actually think that the reason her music videos are still relevant is because of the Easter eggs. It\u2019s the only reason I watch them (other than the fact that I will happily consume any media created by Taylor Swift). I can\u2019t even remember the last time I purposely sought out and watched another artist\u2019s music videos. Maybe it\u2019s just me, but they kind of seem like a dying art.",
                "honestly, other than karma, which music video is just a series of Easter eggs? bejewelled has lots, yes, but it\u2019s clearly a story (100% representing the lyrics as well), lavender haze shows her literally being in the lavender haze with her partner (with some Easter eggs but the lyrics are fully visualised), and anti-hero has some storytelling in the funeral scene along with really creative scenes illustrating her insecurities (which is part of what the song is about). what\u2019s all the fuss?",
                "Hard disagree from me. i would say i like her older music videos more but only for nostalgia more than anything. her more recent ones are arguably more high quality and are very fun to watch. she is a good director and the easter eggs are fun to look for.",
                "Her videos are great. If anyone killed music videos it\u2019s artists who twerk and don\u2019t do much else. I swear this sub should be renamed \u201cTaylor Swift Haters Society\u201d.",
                "I'm not a huge fan of any of Taylor's self directed music videos TBH other than Cardigan Willow, and ATW. I'm exhausted by the constant easter eggs we are supposed to be looking for since the Lover Era videos",
                "Completely agreed.  Her videos now are low budget fan service at this point.  I couldn't believe the abysmal production and effects in the Karma video.",
                "I love her music but tbh, her music videos make me scared for her film. They are very personal to her and give hints to the audience but I don\u2019t find them particularly compelling. She pulls a lot of imagery and references all together and it can be fun but it\u2019s not like.. what a music video should be, imo. Which is to tell a story of something. I\u2019m thinking of the most impactful music videos and for whatever reason I just keep getting the visuals of Justin Bieber\u2019s As Long As You Love Me which was such wild ride but felt connected and deepened the song for me. Compared to the Karma video for example, which just, didn\u2019t make sense at all to me.",
                "She has a few newer ones that I like but ever since Reputation I feel like her music videos are hit or miss.",
                "This is too dramatic and if I\u2019m not wrong I can see you MV is a perfect balance between Easter eggs and the storytelling.She told the story quite effectively how she wanted to and I don\u2019t think there is a problem in that , same for antihero bejeweled .Karma was just a fun video I guess and I like it .I agree that Love story MV and all are great but these ones are awesome too and it \u201chasn\u2019t ruined the experience\u201d",
                "I think she still tells the story with the MAIN music video of the year (anti hero for example), and the other extra videos are more for easter eggs and fun stuff not telling the full story - bejeweled, LH, karma, and ICSY. This is my hypothesis atleast. Seems to track with previous albums too (not re-recorded ones), except perhaps Look What You Made Me Do (but that's a story in itself so, the MV explains the meaning of the song more than the song tbvh in my opinion).",
                "Maybe an unpopular opinion but I don't think she should direct all her videos. Sometimes a video should just be that, a video, and not a landmine of Easter eggs. I desperately long for another Joseph Kahn co-production or something. I also appreciate Taylor's humor but (and again, this might be a personal take) I don't get much enjoyment of seeing the same comic scene over and over again. Meanwhile, artsy shots and great visuals are eternal.",
                "i don't see any issue with watching her videos. self reference in the videos is a part of the art. the I can see you music video is based on the references and they are not easter eggs... they are just part of the video. \n\nI watch the video first and don't really care about the \"easter eggs\" and honestly, most of the easter eggs are not at all. it is just the fandom going bonkers and making EVERY little thing complicated. Taylor has always made the little nods in her videos to be very apperent and NOT complicated yet the fandom makes these elaborate theories and it is kind of crazy.",
                "I have to agree that her videos usually do too much. I loved the ATW mv and I wish she did simple narrative stories like that more. I admit I'm generally meh on music videos as an art form, so I figure they are for other fans that get a kick out of them.",
                "I basically just watch her videos once because they\u2019re not that good whereas her old ones I could watch over and over again. I do like ATW, Anti-Hero, and I bet You think of Me though. \n\nI\u2019m not sure how much of it is just her writing the storylines for the music videos and directing them though. For me that\u2019s when they started to go downhill but that also coincides with the easter eggs ramping up too",
                "Low key agree, stuff like LWYMMD and to a lesser extent bejewelled had a good balance but now it\u2019s way too much. \n\nIn general though I think her videos have suffered a decline since rep especially since she directed them herself, the exceptions in my opinion being willow and cardigan",
                "Well put. It's so annoying that as soon as she drops a video, people start speculating about what she is hinting at (and when that thing drops, we can speculate about the next song again). \n\nIt seem hurried to me, and I feel it's a shame we can't just enjoy the current music she is putting out.",
                "For me, the tipping point on too many Easter eggs was the Me! video.  I loved the references in the LWYMMD video.  I thought Cardigan was beautiful. I don\u2019t mind the I can See You video.  Love the Anti-Hero video.  But I don\u2019t rewatch most of the videos Taylor\u2019s directed other than those three because I\u2019m just not into Easter eggs, no matter how much she enjoys them.",
                "100000% with you here. her earlier mvs were fun and more about the music and storytelling, which are the things that make me love her. her self-directed later mvs are way too focused on the taylor swift lore which, as big of a fan as i am, has been tiring for a while now.",
                "I didn\u2019t even notice it was full of Easter eggs (except the clock). I thought it was about gaining ownership of her Masters through the re-recordings. She\u2019s been set free (with the help from some blasts from the past, which was super fun) and is in control now.\n\nSame with Karma, actually, except the end which has some obvious clues. I think this is just the face of music videos now. A lot of them are just cut and produced like in this more sporadic manner.\n\nI think that if you want to look for Easter eggs, you can, but it\u2019s not mandatory or distracting. This is just my opinion as someone who doesn\u2019t really pay attention to them though.",
                "The whole spy theme is very relevant to the vibe of \"I Can See You.\" The point was those who love and support her -- us fans -- are helping her to save her art.\n\nI think the easter eggs just add an additional dimension. The videos absolutely can be appreciated as storytelling even without the hidden clues.",
                "Taylor is not the only artist in the world and if you don\u2019t like her videos why don\u2019t you just watch other videos",
                "She thought it would give a replay value but in reality, it just made her music videos less enjoyable because of too much Easter eggs. Not gonna lie, I miss the 1989 era music videos. THE VISUALS 100%.",
                "Ok ok ok ok DON\u2019T COME AT ME. But. As a director myself who works in the music industry (mainly designing concert visuals, but I have a background in theatre directing), I don\u2019t find Taylor to be an interesting director. I love the metaphor and depth in her writing, but I don\u2019t think she\u2019s reached that yet in a visual medium. Except for Lavender Haze; I thought that video was weird but that\u2019s why I liked it. I loved the videos she did with Joseph Kahn, but of course pop music video directing is his main thing. I think she is exploring her voice as a director. 18yo Taylor couldn\u2019t have written folklore so I don\u2019t expect this Taylor to direct the Parasite of music videos.\n\nAlso I recognize i kind of directly disagree with your take on music videos in general - I don\u2019t love literal music videos but that\u2019s just personal taste. That\u2019s why ATW kind of bored me.",
                "I wholeheartedly agree with this.\n\nTaylor is our capitalist queen, we all know this, haha. She\u2019s aware of the intensity at which her most dedicated fans talk about Easter eggs with every single move she makes. She knows the fans will watch the music videos over and over to see if they got all the hints and Easter eggs\u2026meaning she gets more $$$ from all the views and replays.\n\nShe\u2019s also aware that being known for Easter eggs has so much longevity for her career because that\u2019s her \u201cthing.\u201d It\u2019ll never go away, and it\u2019s fun for us every time. Fans will always be talking about them, looking for them, and theorizing. It keeps people filled with anticipation, so when the new release or announcement finally comes, it\u2019s *huge*\u2026meaning her music instantly hits (and stays) on the charts.\n\nPerfect example: in the weeks leading up to the *Speak Now (Taylor\u2019s Version)* announcement, she was dropping hints all over her IG posts. We all knew it was coming and we were dying see it. We stayed on the concert livestreams on socials waiting for the official announcement to pop up. When it happened, everything blew up. We\u2019re her cheapest and easiest form of marketing.\n\nI would love to see more music videos that are a perfect blend of storytelling and Easter eggs like \u201cBejeweled\u201d was, so hopefully that\u2019s kinda where she goes with the next one. I even liked the \u201cLavender Haze\u201d video. But with \u201cKarma\u201d and \u201cI Can See You,\u201d those were basically Easter Egg slideshows!",
                "I'm sorry but I'm going to disagree.   \n\n\nArt is never one thing, ever, consistently in its creation. It's not a show, it's not a film with a sequel.   \n\n\nIt's a music video. And yeah, the Easter Eggs may've become more prominent but on the flip side, there's \\*always\\* a story being told in every single one of her MVs, even in Rep, there was a story line. Sometimes it doesn't always allude to the lyrical aspects of the song it portrays, but frankly compared to the rest of the industry right now, and as of late, she's certainly putting out a story \\*regardless\\*.   \n\n\nThat's my two cents on the matter.",
                "Man, she just can't win. Literally everything she does, people will complain. Fans asked for more Easter eggs and she gave them. And now all these people in the comments are tired of them. Make up your mind, guys! Having watched most of her videos with my Mom, who is an extremely casual fan and doesn't know anything about Easter eggs, I can definitely say that her videos are extremely enjoyable for casual viewers too! But I know that's not what you meant. The problem is, you are choosing to watch her videos hunting for Easter eggs and then you get mad when you are pulled out of the story/overall experience. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",
                "Are you sure you're not ruining the experience for yourself? Yes, there are Easter Eggs and there is a hunt for them to be had... but you don't have to.\nThere are a lot of casual watchers who don't even notice anything.\nYou get to chose how you experience the video.\nDo I hit the space back and squint at a spot and go \"a... HA. I knew it said 1989.\"? Yes. Cause it's fun. Do I try to anylize every frame or worry or care about all the things I miss? Nah. And you can *decide* to look at it that way, too.",
                "I've been thinking recently how annoying some of her more recent videos are with the sound effects coming through the song.  And don't get me started on the whole prelude and interlude on Anti-Hero and Bejeweled. Cute at first, but then turns into immediate skips for me.  Add I can see you to that list... I just want to listen to the sooooonnngggg.",
                "I totally Agree! I watch her music videos for the Story not the Easter Eggs but I think that\u2019s just based on her fan base. If her Easter Egg fan base wasn\u2019t so big I feel like her story telling side would her only focus. Plus, Every fan wants to know what inspired the song and sometimes the music videos is the best clues for that. Also, to see the story the lyrics tell come to life how Taylor sees them in her head is quite extraordinary. \n\nHowever, think of the song Mirror Ball she wants us to keep looking at her. The Easter Eggs are to just keep us talking about her. She never wants to hear \u201cwhose Taylor Swift Anyway again! This is Perfectly Fine for artists to do because once irrelevant then they are more hurting the people they pay like make up artists and back up dancers. \n\nIn the future I really would like to see the mix of both like in Bejeweled! TBHT I\u2019m not a bejeweled fan, but I did like Look What You Made Me Do!",
                "She\u2019s had some terrible videos. Still not over delicate.",
                "I think the music video for \"I Can See You\" captures the vibe of the song oh so well. My first thought listening to it was that it would fit perfectly in a spy movie. I remember wondering if Taylor had rewatched Mr. and Mrs. Smith while writing the song. Yeah the plot of the mv doesn't exactly fit the lyrics. But the vibe of it definitely does. I think it's completely okay for the plot of an mv to not fit the lyrics as long as it nails the vibe of the song and that's exactly what \"I Can See You\" does.",
                "I agree. I Can See You felt like such a strange music video. I asked about how it related to the song because I didn\u2019t get it. \n\nBut I\u2019ve always been more a fan of music videos that actually go with the song lyrically. So that\u2019s always been my preference no matter what.",
                "I think Swifties expect too much of Taylor at times. The I can see you music video was suppose to be a fun music video and experiment for her. She likes heist and nori stuff and wanted to direct a video that reflected that interest. I\u2019m return she gave us Easter eggs, call backs to speak now and a confirmation on the next re record. \n\nSometimes music videos don\u2019t have to reflect the lyrics sometimes they are a chance for the artist to a good time. And I think that is what she wanted to accomplish here.\n\nSame with the Karma music video. She had to repair the damage Matt (and her by dating him) caused with Ice Spice commments. So she brought her in and made a quick music video with the remix version of the song. It wasn\u2019t the best but it\u2019s what she could do with the time she had and the circumstances around it. \n\nOverall we have gotten really amazing videos from Taylor and her team and I\u2019m ok with a few sub par ones (presumed by some ). She can\u2019t be perfect you know \ud83d\ude1b",
                "I kind of feel similarly. Even if the video matches the song, the fans pick every tiny thing to be an Easter egg and she has leaned so much into making the easter eggs that I feel burned out on the concept and just want to listen to the music already.",
                "I so agree. I find it very hard to mention any negative points about her, since she\u2019s so perfect in almost every way. Her videos just fall behind though. Most of them feel childish, with all those easter eggs and messages.\n\nJust give me some good old atmospheric videos, such as ATW10. She\u2019s even going to direct a movie, why not start with directing actual good videos around the mood of her songs then?",
                "I\u2019ll take it one step further and state a VERY unpopular opinion which is that I\u2019ve never liked a single TS video despite being a massive fan \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 they just do not do it for it me and I could gripe for hours about them. So, fair take!!! lol",
                "y\u2019all are insufferable and will find anything to complain about.",
                "Agree, I\u2019m ready for this re-recording and Easter egg era to be over. It was fun for a bit but it\u2019s getting tiring",
                "I REALLY would\u2019ve loved a music video for I Can See You that is relevant to the lyrics.",
                "i basically have a whole mv in my head when i listen to any song for the first time,her music videos are cool and all,but they lack telling the actual story in the lyrics :(",
                "Her music video production value is really high but it doesn't seems to click for me. I never really liked any of her music videos. I could only watch her singing live. It's just more raw.",
                "AGREEEEE",
                "Definitely not unpopular. I really hate blatant easter eggs in the MVs especially when they are completely unrelated to the MVs like light bulbs (Electric Touch) and hourglass (Timeless) in Karma. I really blame Look What You Made Her Do for setting that trend.\n\nI miss the days of Ours and Begin Again. I always go back to them. Wildest Dreams had easter eggs too but you really need to go deep to notice them. That's what I want.",
                "My partner is very pleased she's committed to making a film because he's hoping it'll stop her \"interrupting her own song with 2 minutes of dialogue\" when he just wants to listen to the damn song \ud83d\ude02",
                "Taylor Swift is not good at directing and someone needs to tell her that. I love her, but please the Bejeweled music video was one of if not her worst music video of all time. I love the song and visually it looked good, but it was nonsense. And chalk full of obnoxious \u201cEaster eggs\" that I'm getting really tired of. An Easter egg used to be taylor writing us secret messages in the lyric book or posting a photo of herself wearing red shoes in recording studio. \n\nKarma feat. Ice Spice was beautiful to look at, and that's all there is to say about it. My favourite of her recent music videos is IBYTAM and Taylor didn't direct it. Blake Lively did a wonderful job. Taylor makes things that are beautiful to look at, but the through line stories are a complete mess and leave you wondering what the hell she was trying to convey. Good for her for trying to branch out but it's not working. Just my opinion.",
                "Maybe she ruins the experience of watching Taylor Swift videos. Rammstein's recent music videos are still very enjoyable for instance, Taylor Swift didn't \"ruin\" those.",
                "I think after the re-records the Easter eggs will fall off. She knows her fans are excited and the videos are essentially an extra treat, Midnights being about sleepless nights in her career or at least claiming so allows her further Easter egg liberties",
                "Can anyone spill the Easter eggs on \u201cI can see you now\u201d music video? Is there a post on it?",
                "I think the biggest reason this is happening right now is because we KNOW what\u2019s coming in the future. We KNOW we\u2019re going to get rep TV, 1989 TV, and TSTV, so we LOOK for things that could indicate those are coming. When we used to not anticipate the upcoming projects, the Easter eggs were just for fun, like Joe\u2019s name in another language on a wall in Ready For It, or the the dollar in the bathtub in LWYMMD. All fun little Easter eggs that didn\u2019t affect the experience of the music video either way. Once we stop knowing what projects are coming up, I think the music video experience will go back to normal for all of us.",
                "I used to watch music videos as a way to listen to the song. With streaming, they're not necessary. Maybe we should be viewing music videos as an audio format similar to cassettes or CDs, in the sense that they served a purpose for a short time, but with different ways to listen to music, society moves on. I think music videos will be more similar to CDs in the sense that they are made but don't drive public awareness of the song.",
                "Watch Unforgiven by Metallica and let me know what you think, homie",
                "This is why Back to December is the ultimate music video and always will be.",
                "The scene in bejeweled when she\u2019s in the glass confused me.",
                "I\u2019m a weird funny way as well, you could say Music Videos have been ruined for a while lol. Michael Jackson did to music video what Michael Jordan did to basketball. But this is really just a gag comment mostly haha.",
                "I agree. I can see you could\u2019ve been a really sexy video but instead it had nothing to do with the song. I did still enjoy the metaphor and video but I don\u2019t really understand why it was for this particular song? The significance was lost on me a bit (I do get it\u2019s a vault track and she was breaking into a vault to rescue SN). \n\nI enjoyed bejewelled and ATW10 but I didn\u2019t care for I bet you think about me, it felt too fan service-y.",
                "I think overall this post is a little dramatic but I will say that lately Taylor\u2019s videos have left me wanting ever since reputation. Her 1989 music videos are all incredible; they have a storyline, match the vibe of the song, and when there are Easter eggs they\u2019re subtle. It feels like especially when Taylor herself is behind the camera the focus for the music video is to serve up Easter eggs for us to find and any story is a secondary. When Taylor does focus on a storyline like the ATW \u201cshort film\u201d it feels really on the nose and blunt. \nIt feels like the more music videos she directs the less subtle her videos become. Instead of a strong storyline (with the exception of the ATW short film and the Bejeweled video) it feels like she focuses on short tableaus that look cool and that she can stuff to the brim with hints and references. Sometimes this can kinda work like The Man music video showing various examples of how men benefit within a patriarchal society. But mostly as a result the music video doesn\u2019t enhance the experience of listing to the song and instead becomes about anticipating what\u2019s coming next. It feels like the song is almost an afterthought.",
                "she had like 2 music videos with a ton of Easter eggs (Karma and ICSY) and you guys already whine about it? can't please everyone I guess. I don't like it when it's just a ton of Easter eggs slapping together like Karma, but to say she ruined the experience of watching a mv because of two videos is truly such a weird and hopefully will stay unpopular take.",
                "Maybe easter eggs = more engagement than just storytelling? Easter eggs are a huge part of Taylor's persona and formula for success, and I don't see her toning them down unless she has an artistic shift in priorities.",
                "I feel like music videos are just not as valued today was they were in the past, and Taylor is just using that to make music videos as a vehicle for Easter eggs because that guarantees views.",
                "Personally i don't care much about the Easter eggs, at least not the ones you cannot see at a first glance, so I still enjoy the video. \n\nI usually don't dig deeper than just enjoying the video. :)",
                "Lol I don\u2019t try to look for Easter eggs in music videos I just enjoy the video",
                "As someone who doesn\u2019t care about or track Easter eggs\u2026..they only affect the viewing experience of her videos if you\u2019re looking for them.  With a gun to my head I couldn\u2019t tell you which eggs are in which video, or even list 5 of them.",
                "Red TV Had \u201cI Bet You Think About Me\u201dand that wasn\u2019t related to any upcoming projects. Same w/ ATW10Min Version \n\nLavender Haze video wasn\u2019t filled w Easter eggs to the point where it was distracting to the video. I thought it was pretty straight forward.",
                "I also think (ducks) her direction of the MVs is pretty basic, I would like her to let full time directors take a stab at more creative takes",
                "I think I Can See You is her best music video in a while. I liked Bejeweled too but it was still too much talking for my taste, but at least it had a story that fit the song. I would prefer more literal storytelling videos that match the songs lyrics like YBWM, Teardrops on my Guitar, Blank Space, Wildest Dreams, All Too Well, etc. too but hardly any artists make literal story telling music videos anymore. I think Taylor as she\u2019s branching into directing she\u2019s tryna be more artsy - see cardigan and willow music videos rather than straight forward literal.",
                "I\u2019m with you. I just don\u2019t pay attention to that stuff. If I don\u2019t actively look for them I generally don\u2019t notice them, but I know for many that\u2019s not the case.\n\nThere\u2019s so much great Taylor stuff out already that I\u2019ll just wait for official announcements on what\u2019s next",
                "I knew that that video in the Lover era where Taylor explains Easter eggs was a bad omen, lol. \n\nIn my opinion, Lover was the rise of Easter Eggs in videos and I blame it on swifties. Easter eggs were pretty much niche, even in the 1989 era, fans discussed the Easter Eggs on Tumblr and it wasn\u2019t as widespread as it is now. The LWYMMD video is full of Easter eggs, but that actually fits the reputation era. Suddenly, in Lover, swifties theories regarding Easter eggs were encouraged by Taylor. In 2020, the folklore documentary was released. Clips were all over TikTok so the Easter eggs, the love triangle, and lore of her albums became even more known. Taylor, as the people pleaser she is, made the Anti-Hero and Bejeweled MV full of Easter eggs. \n\nIn short, looking for Easter eggs became trendy and gained her more streams on YouTube, so Taylor just continued feeding her fans.\n\nBuuut I wouldn\u2019t blame the current quality of her videos only on the Easter eggs, though. Anti-Hero is such a great video with awesome storytelling, LWYMMD is good. She can make great videos with Easter eggs. My problem is with Karma, it\u2019s horrible, and Lavender Haze is just aesthetically pleasing. Like you mentioned, Wildest Dreams has simple, beautiful storytelling, just like her songs. It\u2019d be great if she returned to her old style of music videos, but she wants to be taken seriously as a filmmaker. The current long MVs will be going on for a while, and so will the Easter eggs because currently, they make more views. Look at cardigan and willow, those videos don\u2019t have as much streams as those with Easter eggs.",
                "I really thought I was alone in this thinking. Whether it is us or her that are to blame, I miss music videos that actually had to do with the song. Like the \"I can see you\" video didn't really seem to have anything to do with what the actual song is about.",
                "music videos in general aren\u2019t really important for a song\u2019s success in the way that they used to be \u2014 in most cases, they\u2019re really just there for fans. taylor\u2019s fans in general have expressed interest when she does callbacks to past eras and hints towards future ones, so i imagine she adds some in now to cater towards that. i\u2019m sure it also helps her videos get more views!",
                "my favourite music vids by her are cardigan and LWYMMD\u2026 my least favourite is karma",
                "Partially agree, because I think she still has the capability for Easter egg filled videos that tell stories. The bejeweled music video perfectly encapsulates the song and additionally manages to be the most Easter egg filled videos of hers to date",
                "I have no problems not looking for Easter eggs in her videos. I just watch and enjoy the videos and wait for other people to point out the Easter eggs for me.",
                "I mostly agree, but the ICSY video definitely had a story to it. But yeah, most of the Midnights videos (maybe besides Bejeweled) felt more like visualizers than actual videos lol",
                "IMO, she did this with I Can See You specifically because she does not have an explanation/story she\u2019s willing to tell for those lyrics. So she made up something unrelated to the song/more related to her fandom. \n\nBut no way you can watch Anti-Hero and claim she\u2019s \u201cruined music videos\u201d and \u201cthe art of story telling\u201d \u2026 or I Bet You Think About Me? That\u2019s just\u2026 insane.",
                "I actually thought I Can See You was the best self-directed MV because there *was* an actual story to it. Though I only really watch music videos like once.",
                "100% agree. She could be making masterpieces with her budget and creative genius but the fan-service is actually messing that up",
                "Music videos have always been ALL over the place and so many are just completely nonsensical. I like that Taylor tells stories in hers, even if they're not overtly related to the lyrics.",
                "I have no real opinions on this but I don't agree that most other music videos \"are known for\" storytelling. Many of them are straightforward stories but I'd say *most* of the music videos I've seen in my life are frankly pretty weird and very much not straightforward stories.",
                "The vault music videos so far have both been about reclaiming her work so I'm ok with those being the way they are.",

                "I dunno, I feel like she does a pretty good job of doing both at the same time.  I don't feel like the Easter eggs take away from the story.",
                "100% YES! I love her older music videos so much because they're actual music videos. They tell stories. Everything she's been putting out lately is just an Easter egg hunt, and it really takes away from the experience.",
                "She\u2019s done unrelated music videos for a while. I remember being confused with the Ready For It? Music video. It had a story but nothing to do with the lyrics.",
                "I thought this was going to be how annoying it is when she does long stretches of \"talking\" scenes - like the beginning of IKYWT or ME! or Anti-Hero... that's what keeps me from replaying the video over and over, it takes me out of the song.\n\nI don't mind the easter eggs because you can just watch the video without going Easter egg hunting and just have fun, you know?\nAlso I don't think Taylor is totally to blame. Like some have said, it's also the fans. And there are some k-pop groups that make videos that have nothing to do with the song and instead just ties back to really elaborate lore. Nothing to do with what will come next but just putting in stuff from an overarching theme... at least Taylor puts in references that most of us can understand.",

                "I kinda see what you mean, but I also disagree personally. There are a few of her music videos that are more Easter egg heavy of course like Karma, but I don\u2019t think the majority of her music videos even the recently released ones are. Antihero for me felt like it focused heavily on the actual song and story. Although I\u2019m not one to actively search for Easter eggs so maybe I missed something.",

She took time during the Eras tour to film it and it related to the release of her album- included the koi guitar- has Taylor Lautner in it- it was just her having a fun throwback to her younger years. \nI even commented to my friend that it felt a little clunky but it wasn\u2019t about the costumes or wigs or acting, it was about finding every single thing she wanted us to find.",

            "title": "I think I\u2019m in a minority here, but I didn\u2019t love the musical episode.",
            "selftext": "I know some people came to this episode who just don't like musicals, or thought this was a bad idea from the start. That wasn't my perspective: I enjoy musicals, and I thought this was a lot of fun. Goofy as hell, but I watched it with a smile on my face. A musical episode is a big risk, but the writers threaded the needle very well, and I\u2019m glad that they\u2019re able to take such risks. I loved how they built an explanation of musical theatre logic into the story: when emotions get too big for words, people sing (and when emotions get too big for singing, they dance). Having the crew try to use that to predict how and where the anomaly will strike next, felt like a uniquely Star Trek approach to the concept. Speaking as a fan, I liked the episode. But as a musician, I thought the music could have been done better.\n\nHaving the opening title music be sung was a nice idea. But they didn\u2019t lean into it enough. The vocal performances were muted, and many of the instruments were still present. So it was really just the normal opening titles, but with some instrumental layers replaced by vocal imitations. If you\u2019re going to do it, I think you need to do it all the way: replace percussion with beatbox, have everything be fully a cappella, and perform it with some flair.\n\nI enjoyed the performances in the episode, but I thought the songs themselves weren\u2019t very good. They suffered from having vague, poorly-defined melodies. Ten minutes after the episode ended, I couldn\u2019t have hummed back a tune from any of the songs. La\u2019an\u2019s performance was very strong, but the vocal melody lacked a clear shape. Uhura gave a great performance, especially when the song finally shifted up into her soprano range, but her only musical phrase that stuck in my head was \u201ckeep us connected\u201d. The only other phrase that stuck in my memory was Spock\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m the (e)x\u201d, and that was about it. There just weren\u2019t enough hooks in the songs. I\u2019m sure I would have a better grasp of the music if I listened to it a few more times, but a good song from a musical should be able to get into your head on the first hearing.\n\nKirk and Una shared a duet early on, a waltz in the style of classic musicals (they name-checked Gilbert and Sullivan, but the music reminded me more of Rodgers and Hammerstein), and this gave me hope that the show would feature a broad range of styles. But apart from that number, the music stayed firmly in the present day. That was a missed opportunity. What sounds fresh and modern today is only going to sound more dated in the future, and the choice of genre could have told us a lot more about each character.\n\nChapel\u2019s song, which sounded like a knockoff of Amy Winehouse\u2019s \u201cBack to Black\u201d, had some great visual energy as an ensemble + dance number. But that energy wasn't matched by the music: I would have liked to hear more of an ensemble sound when the whole bar got going. There were some vocal harmonies in there, but I think it was only ever a couple of people at a time.\n\nThe vocal lines often sounded like they didn\u2019t fit the actors, almost as if they had been written with other people in mind. Spock\u2019s song had him mostly singing very high and light in his voice (apart from one low note), even though one of Spock\u2019s most recognisable characteristics, in both Ethan Peck\u2019s portrayal and Leonard Nimoy\u2019s, is his rich baritone. Chapel\u2019s song did the opposite, having her sing much lower than expected, and in a register where she didn\u2019t sound strong (undermining the song\u2019s message, and not in a way that felt like deliberate subversion). Anson Mount sang with a different accent. The differences were so pronounced that I was sometimes distracted by wondering if these were their real voices.\n\nThe autotune was dialled up to an aggressive level. Spock and Chapel in particular sounded like they\u2019d had the most adjustments, but it was heavily applied across the board. It gave everyone\u2019s voice a metallic, electronic tone. I'm not naive, I know that pitch correction is used in nearly everything, but it\u2019s possible to use it without making the singers sound like robots, and I\u2019d much rather hear human voices than this shiny, artificial sound.\n\nAnother missed opportunity was the big finale. The prospect of needing the whole crew to sing got me excited. I was ready for a number like \u201cOne Day More\u201d from Les Miserables: overlapping melodies, cross-cutting between the different sections of the ship, the whole thing coming together in a great big chorus. But instead we got a song about \u201cwe\u2019re the crew, and we stick together\u201d with everyone waiting their turn to add their line. This prevented it from being able to build up enough energy to sound like a true, big-ensemble number. And the one (1) shot of crew members dancing in a corridor wasn\u2019t enough. This was the moment when they needed to make the dancing look like a proper Broadway musical, and I guess they didn\u2019t have the budget for that?\n\nAnd finally, the Klingons. I laughed, but I also cringed very hard.",

                "Not weird at all, but don't discount newer artists just because they're \"new.\" There are lots of bands making new music nowadays that's just as good as the older bands you're into, you just probably won't find them on the radio. Most popular music today has one goal: to appeal to the widest audience possible, and make as much money as possible. This leads to everything sounding kind of same-y because there's a handful of writers/producers creating a significant portion of the big hits on top 40 stations. They have refined their craft to make short, catchy songs that require much less artistic vision to be financially successful.\n\nIn my opinion, the biggest advantage of listening to newer music is being able to go to their live shows. As much as I wish Pink Floyd (for example) would go on tour again, it's just not gonna happen. You can see Pink Floyd cover bands, of course, and I'm sure you'll have a great time, but it's obviously not the same.\n\nOff the top of my head, based on the bands you listed, you might enjoy King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard, The Lemon Twigs, Goose, Foxygen, Wilco.\n\nTry not to fall into the trap of thinking \"all new music sucks\" because it comes off as incredibly pretentious. If you start talking to someone about music and open with that kind of sentiment, chances are they will not want to keep talking about music with you. \n\nPeople tend to view old music through rose tinted glasses, and only remember the good stuff (of which there is a lot) and not the bad stuff (of which there is a *lot* more). It's just nobody talks about the bad stuff because it's become largely irrelevant. The same applies to music today: there is a lot of good stuff out there, but significantly more bad stuff. The more open minded you can be when it comes to music, the more music you will find that you enjoy. Might have to dig through a lot of crap because we simply don't know (and *can't* know) which artists will stand the test of time.",
                "Love that music. But there is definitely music made today that is great music. I was in the same boat as you until I started actively trying to find new music, and what do you know found some bands that scratch a similar itch as those grand bands from the 70\u2019s. \n\nThis is a long shot but try Babe Rainbow. I\u2019m a dead head and love this band, nice silky smooth, slightly psychedelic. If you like them, go down the rabbit hole! \n\nBut in the end, who cares, listen to what you like.",

They\u2019ve got tunes totally on par with the best of classic rock. \n\nI\u2019m confident if you enjoy magical mystery tour by the Beatles you will enjoy Tame Impala\u2019s first album. It\u2019s a very John Lennon sound. \n\nI will go against the grain and say yes, it is weird. Bc we have access to so much music for free, you should be able to find something from today you also enjoy. Someone you could potentially see live someday, someone to look forward to a new album. Those are great experiences, that we can\u2019t ever really experience with the classics, while they\u2019re very reliable. \n\nI recommend checking out the BIRP! (Blalock indie rock playlist) they make one every month, for the last 15 years at least, and there\u2019s ~5-7hours of new independently produced (not by big labels) music. https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0vGVSumNg4op24tjGkwkYT?si=Lxdv7w0cSM6YeYQ7RSeXbA here\u2019s a Spotify link to July 2023.

New playlist every month too, so you will find at least one newer band you might want to follow if you care to take the time to sample them. \n\nMost people making music probably enjoy a lot of the same stuff you do and are replicating it in various ways. But you won\u2019t find experimental stuff like Floyd or Rush via pop-culture, so you\u2019ll have to dig for it. They won\u2019t be viral or on radio, your friends won\u2019t know about them. But they\u2019re still selling shows to 5,000 ppl that rock and live music sounds better in smaller venues. You\u2019re at an age where you should be going to live shows, and I wouldn\u2019t want you to be restricted to John Mayer playing with the dead, although they\u2019re a great show of you get the chance, way better than expected.",

And frequently learning the history and influences improves the experience of contemporary stuff. \n\nBut it goes the other way too, if you dig deep into the stuff coming out these days, you might have to dig deeper, but there is stuff you\u2019ll enjoy. And that\u2019s fun because there will be a lot more community, you can see them grow as an artist in real time, interact with them and you can go to shows that aren\u2019t just an 80 year old man playing for a football stadium. \n\nThis turned into quite a ramble, but go to more shows, maybe learn an instrument, and you\u2019ll find your people.

I generally agree that rock music was a lot better before I was born, but I don\u2019t think that means no one can make any good rock music anymore. \n\nAnswer: no there\u2019s nothing wrong with listening to what you like. You like what you like and there\u2019s nothing wrong with it.\n\nEdit: the music you listen to reflects your personality, feelings, beliefs, and mood.

Before that they smashed the media teams drone, went on a drunken political ramble.\nThen fled the country at 3am. Thanks guys. Real heroic. \n\nOur government isn't the best, we know. It's the better of the two at this point. We have our problems.

As a 24 year old hip hop connoisseur i even had the same question as a lot of people on this post and asked where is some rock music? So i did some digging and found the obvious answer that rock is dead. But it probably worse than u can think actually. Out of the 10 bands with the most number 1 songs on the US Hot Rock & alternative billboard only 1 of them have had a song reach the US HOT 100 (which is a chart for all music genres) this year in 2023 and it was Linkin Park with \u201cLost\u201d.  The only other REAL rock song i could find that hit the HOT 100 was a Falling in Reverse song. So not only is Rock considered dead but its damn near extinct when it comes to how its performing commercially. So what does this mean for madden and other games? Long story short this basically means we will NEVER see rock music again on a madden soundtrack or really any video game soundtracks because its not the popular genre at all\u2026 like not even a little bit. This is because these companies want to make money and if the music brings in more players then they will only go with what is MOST POPULAR\u2026 which in this case is rap. There is a wayyyy higher likely chance we will have country music in madden in the future than rock music ever even sniffing a madden soundtrack again. It sucks because i love rock music but until rock music becomes popular in mainstream media again this is the reality of where music is currently at in the modern day and it doesn\u2019t look like its gonna change.",

The NFL are just as guilty as EA since they refuse to let any other company use the license. Run the Jewels and Kendrick and other good musicians are like \"keep my name off your trash ass game\"",

And worst of all, they don\u2019t even have the instrumental football music anymore, even that\u2019s been replaced with generic lame ass rap beats!\n\nScrew Madden the video game!

Some songs get a bit overly simplistic with their lyrics, so the pool of unique words he uses for lyrics can get quite small.\n\nYes, there are several exceptions to this, like The Morning, HOB/GTG, Kiss Land, Tell Your Friends, Sidewalks (although Kendrick was also on that), several of his earlier features like Gifted, Heartless, and Escape from LA, but the examples have seemed to become a little bit sparse recently.\n\nThis usually doesn\u2019t affect my liking of the songs that much. UIBO and Final Lullaby are by far my favorite songs on After Hours, even if their lyrics aren\u2019t as \u201ccomplex\u201d as some of the songs I listed.\n\nBut, overall, sometimes, I just wish the vocabulary in his songs felt a bit more flexible.",

Kissland, Starboy, MDM, After Hours and Dawn FM don't necessarily sound the same but if you were to put all the songs from each album on a playlist you would get an overwhelming sense of similarity or at least imo. He does the 80's synth pop sound too much. I think BBTM actually stands out in his post Trilogy catalog because it was before he started doing the synth pop stuff.

                "og XO fan but i have notes\u2026\nafter kissland his music sounded very structured. \nBBTM production was very upbeat and was formulated (i.e. verse, chorus, verse 2, chorus- using the same melody throughout the whole song and no surprises-basically every pop song formula) remember how im he use to make long songs that sound free and fun? (Party&theafterparty, Gone, Initiation, EOS, Thursday..) \nStarboy was the same with better production..\nMDM was a breath of fresh air, he went back to his roots and sang freely with better production/storyline & great live band sound\nAfter Hours was his visual creative breakthrough & he created this character that was formed through his past experiences- ++ great producer collabs \nDawn FM reminded me of parts of his old self, with old songs he did like Nocturnal, Wild Love, Wanderlust, these old songs remind of Dawn FM. he\u2019s collided upbeat with dark and grimy and it worked perfectly. \nmy prediction for his next chapter is that he\u2019s going to combine Thursday experimental sound with Dawn FM.",

                "There was a point where his music sounded futuristic, but now he\u2019s stuck doing Michael Jackson pastiche and trap-rap retreads of past heights. He needs to kill The Weeknd because the promise of the project as the bold sonic future of music has been dead for almost a decade now.",
                "Let\u2019s be honest here there isn\u2019t really anything. He\u2019s a special type of artist. However maybe personal but his music does take a bit to click and become enjoyable. Not saying his songs are bad on the first or second listen but they come to love after maybe 4 or 5 listens.",
                "The other day I went on genius and read all the lyrics for dawn fm. They're not good, the songs are getting simpler and simpler. It's like he is making music for dumber and dumber audiences.  It's sad since his voice is actually wonderful.\nHe could drop the 80's vibe too, I don't like it.\nDude is on top and I wish he would just start singing about social issues or stuff that is more common to most people. In fact, the dude should check out the album \"how to be a human being\" by glass animals. The concept is wonderful, Dave wrote about stuff he was witnessing around him instead of his own life. It's a masterpiece!\nNo shade to the weeknd thought. Dude is still Killin it anyway.",

High For This is super fucking creepy... \"You don't know what's in store, but you know what your here for\" as he performs some undisclosed sex act... \"Your mind wants to leave... but you can't go\" from HOB/GTG. They are art, good art at that, but they're weird, predatory, and I would not find myself putting them on my playlist cause getting comfortable with that messaging isn't good.",

                "His squeaky ultra-high falsetto can get tedious at times. I appreciate dawn FM a lot bc he experiments with his voice and tries to switch up his vocal delivery on multiple tracks.

There\u2019s a weird energy to him now, it feels like he wants to quit but he\u2019s just not done yet. That\u2019s a compromising space for an artist to be in. I\u2019m sure the criticism of the show is making him even more uncomfortable.",
                "I\u2019ll sound like any other annoying fan, his best music was all in trilogy. Everything after star boy I checked out. Also noticed wayyy more auto tune on his voice in his recent projects when his voice already sounds insane, he changed up the way he sings in his recent projects and I feel it doesn\u2019t showcase his vocals as well as in his trilogy music.",

It hooked me when I first listened to it and I wasn't listening to much else for a year, but now I'm kinda rather  listening to Travis, Future, Metro, 21 or After Hours/Dawn FM. When I do go back to Trilogy and Kissland, it is great, but I don't keep it in my playlist for more than 5 listens before I throw it away for a month again.",

I've seen every episode of every Star Trek, many of them multiple tunes. I write filk songs for Kahless's sake.\n\nAnd yet, my favorite episode of any TV series is still \"Once More with Feeling\" from Buffy the Vampire slayer. The Buffy team managed to perfectly capture the joy of musicals while still advancing the world of the show. They understood that musicals aren't purely silliness- they are about expressing heightened emotion through song and dance. OMWF used the plot device of \"we're trapped in a musical\" to create an emotional turning point for its characters- secrets came out that would have repercussions throughout the rest of the show. And we got to see the inner lives of the characters in a new way. Also there was dance-fighting.\n\nI discovered Buffy when I was in college, and ever since then I've longed for a Star Trek that could pull off a musical episode with the same depth and skill. And I have faith (of the heart) that Strange New Worlds is the one to do it. If you need proof, look at how they handled the Lower Decks crossover! They took a goofy, silly concept and still managed to use it to interact with the existing plot threads and create meaningful, emotional moments. Chapel learning from Boimler that her relationship with Spock was probably doomed was heartbreaking! Boimler convincing Pike to embrace the time he has left with his crew, Mariner getting Uhura to lighten up- it was about the SNW characters and their stories as much as it was about the LD characters and the gimmick.\n\nMusicals are amazing. I've literally never been this excited for a Star Trek episode. Every post I've seen here about the upcoming episode is just complaining, and I do not get it. This is going to be a fantastic episode of Star Trek. I hope its two hours long.\n\nUpdate: Apparently a lot more people hate musicals than I thought. I guess I just live in a theatre kid bubble.",

So it needs to be done very well to be good. But frankly it is SNWs. If this episode sucks(I dont think it will) it will be the first bad episode in the first 2 seasons. Better record then every other Trek. I just hope it is related to the monster/anomoly of the week and not just a musical for musical sake.",

Simple as that. \n\nI\u2019m sure it\u2019ll make sense within the context of the episode (maybe it\u2019s not a musical and it just has someone singing or something), but musicals are inherently awkward to a lot of people, me included.",
                "It\u2019s important to let people like things.  It\u2019s also important to let people not like things.  Very few things are objectively, completely good or bad, likable or unlikable, and Star Trek is not immune to that.  \n\nThe musical is not for me.  I\u2019ll watch it, I probably won\u2019t like it, and that\u2019s fine.  It doesn\u2019t make you wrong for liking it, and I\u2019m not wrong for not liking it.",

But the idea of lighthearted stuff has always been a key component of trek for me. I wish they would go back to 25 episode seasons with tons of fillers. The fillers help flesh out the universe imo. I think it's a logistical and scheduling issue and I won't demand the crew be put through hell in order to put out more episodes per season, but just from a spectator's point of view I love filler, light hearted episodes. Episodic trek has them in spades and those are my favorite trek",

No. But the rest of the show sure is, so I\u2019m willing to give them a chance. They\u2019ve bought a lot of goodwill by being a hopeful optimistic view of the future.",

I personally would prefer not to essentially \"waste\" 1/10th of the season on a format I already know I dont enjoy.\n\nI will of course still watch it. And I imagine it will be well done just as every other episode has been, and I will probably enjoy it to a point. But just as when there are musical episodes in cartoons, I am just not looking forward to it.",

                "I loathe musicals. And I'm probably not going to enjoy the episode. But that's pretty normal. Not every episode is going to be my cup of tea. \n\nBut I'm happy they're exploring new ways to tell a story.",

                "Aside from just generally not being a fan of musicals, for me musical episodes have 3 issues:\n\n* they are typically used as gimmicks as a show's popularity begins to wane, and can be a \"jump the shark\" moment. \n\n* they blur the line of the 4th wall, which does not fit for Star Trek IMO\n\n* they tend to be a tonal shift that can be a bit off-putting. Not to say SNW is a serious drama - they definitely have their light/comedic moments and goofy episodes.",
                "Strange New Worlds can do whatever they feel like as far as I\u2019m concerned. It\u2019s the best Trek we\u2019ve had in decades. Go for it, I say. If it doesn\u2019t totally come off - fine. Most eps are total corkers so far.",

If it was an episode about some members of the crew putting on a musical performance for the crew, fine. Especially sober they\u2019ve established that Number One is a fan. That would make sense. But in the vein (vane?) of BtVS, It\u2019s just a mashup I didn\u2019t need or want.",
                "The thing is, \"Once More With Feeling\" is the exception that proves the rule.\n\nLots of shows have tried musical episodes for whatever reason. Buffy is the only show that has made one work.\n\nI'm not holding my breath that any given TV series will be the 2nd ever show in history to make a good musical episode, and SNW is lumped in with that.",
                "Buffy was also in a position to make a musical episode make sense in-universe. I'm not confident that SNW can do that, not because of any doubts about the show, but because it quite simply doesn't fit the setting. The only things in the trek universe capable of forcing a musical are god like beings like the Q, and \"a Q shows up and makes everything a musical\" needs a very compelling reason behind it to be more than \"look, we wanted to do a musical episode, ok?\" Musical episodes have also gotten a lot more common and the level of effort put into them seems to have dropped accordingly; Once More With Feeling worked because it was unexpected and because its score was both good and organic, and it properly committed to the idea that *everyone* was stuck in a musical to the point of having random streets cleaners dancing in the background of dialogue scenes. That hasn't been the case with a lot of more recent musical episodes. Most of them go full jukebox, and even for most of the ones that did go original score I can't remember a single tune from them (Psych for example).\n\nSNW has a lot of slack built up, and even if this flops it's going to be one episode we move on from so it won't ruin the show or anything, but that means more when we're stuck with ten episode seasons. I'm just concerned that this is going to be more the Community puppet episode than OMWF",
                "no judgment until i watch it. but musicals aren't the same as musical television episodes. musical tv episodes live and die by how well the contrivance, and they are always highly contrived, for the singing is executed. it has feel like more than just 'oh, we have cast members with great voices, let's do a musical'",
                "I am not a fan of the idea but it will probably be the first SNW I dislike. \n\nThis has been done to death at this point. Every nerd show has this annoying musical episode now when they could have spent the time on the actual plot.",

                "I haven't contributed to any negativity on here until now I guess,  but I'm not excited for the episode because musicals aren't a thing I particularly enjoy and I've become tired of shows having musical episodes. I agree that ISNW will do a good job of it and for you and anyone else that is looking forward to the episode I hope you thoroughly enjoy it.",

Maybe I'm all musiced out from doing tech for musicals theater for many years.\n\nBut although I'm not looking forward to it, I'm not going to bash it until it comes out (even if I don't like it, I probably won't bash it after it comes out). But I will give it a shot. The SNW team hasn't let me down, yet.",

                "I'm excited for this too. I was never a performer on stage, but I was a stage hand / orchestra pit percussionist for a decade. I would *LOVE* to do sets/props and run this show. I can't wait to see what they do.",

Don't let any of the negativity get you down, that's just the way the internet works.",
                "I'd be fine with a musical themed episode **but with each season only being 10 episodes long**, is it really what they could be spending time on?",
                "I can understand some of the negativity towards this concept. In a relatively \"grounded\" show (aliens and starships aren't quite a reality at this point), having them burst into song seems ridiculous. It worked for Buffy due to its fantasy nature and a demon who \"cursed\" the characters into singing about their feelings and whatnot. It worked in Supergirl because of an interdimensional being who made it a dream sequence basically. But it seems a bit off-putting for a show like Star Trek. However, since this universe has beings like Trelane/Q, anything is possible. I mean, did we ever expect to see Voyager as a Christmas tree ornament? \n\nI am personally not a fan of the musical format. It largely doesn't work for me. It's why I haven't seen a few of the more recent Disney films (Frozen, Encanto, etc) as I find it distracting for them to suddenly burst into song. However, there are exceptions such as the two shows I mentioned, and as for movies, The Pirate Movie I also enjoy, which is a musical. \n\nBut I am looking forward to seeing how they pull it off on SNW. So far, the cast and everything has been phenomenal. Besides, we're supposed to at least try to have an open mind. That's one of the core lessons from Star Trek",
                "Honestly, I'm surprised that it's taken Trek this long to do a musical episode.",
                "I don't like musicals but thus far SNW has been high quality so I'll give it the benefit of the doubt. I don't think SNW has had a bad episode yet. I liked the goofy fairlyland episode. It was very TOS/TNG. Remember when the Enterprise turned into an Aztec temple or something?",
                "I\u2019m so excited for this, the title of the show is strange new worlds. All the fans saying they aren\u2019t going to watch it are missing out.",
                "And here I am, where I generally do not like musical movies (there are exceptions), but love musical episodes in TV shows. I lump Doctor Horrible into the TV show side, not movie side, of this (and love it). Few have heard/seen the Galavant TV show, but I highly recommend it if you like musical TV episodes. \n\nI\u2019ve never considered whether Trek could do something fluke this, but I\u2019m cautiously optimistic (but still a tad worried). Just a couple more days until we find out!",
                "I\u2019m not a huge musical fan - that said, I\u2019m not against the episode either. \n\nThough I have a brother who is much more unimpressed with the premise. His biggest issue - which I understand to a point - is that as good as S2 has been, they\u2019ve teased some wider plot related things but keep going on tangents like this. After more discussion we figured out it\u2019s more that the seasons are so short, and with the Strike, S3 is likely to have a huge delay. \n\nSo I\u2019d speculate a lot of the displeasure over a musical episode is largely a case of \u201cI\u2019m not into musicals and this is taking up an episode slot from a limited supply.\u201d \n\nWell, that and complaints are always louder than atta-boys.",
                "Same here. I was nervous about it, but they knocked the crossover out of the park, and they knocked the fantasy-esque one out of the park last season, so I've got confidence that it will be good. \n\nPlus, several members of the cast can actually sing, so it should be good.",
                "Didn\u2019t like that episode from Buffy, and I most likely won\u2019t like this one but that\u2019s just my opinion.",
                "Back in Tng days, Picard singing and dancing in the bridge would be recorded as a birthday tribute for Gene Roddenberry. This would end up in the bloopers, not as a whole episode.",

                "I just dislike musicals honestly so that's the biggest reason. Another reason it hits so hard is because modern TV gives us 10 episodes a season at best now. So now, at least 10% of a season I'm just going to straight dislike. If I still got 23 episodes a season I wouldn't care as much if one was a musical.",
                "I hate musicals with a passion. I\u2019d rather rip my arm off and myself over the head with the wet end than watch one.\nHaving said that, I hope you enjoy the episode. I don\u2019t mind them doing a musical episode, it\u2019s just not for me.",
                "They have already pulled off what could have been a disaster of an episode with the Lower Decks crossover. I have very faith that they will make a musical episode worm just as well. This season has been probably one of the most consistently great runs of Star Trek.",
                "Being a negative asshole is the internet\u2019s MO. I\u2019m glad the SNW crew decided to take a risk. They did a show about a fairy tale last season and it was received well. It\u2019s time we stop worrying about of clickbaiting youtubers and twitter \u201ccontent creators\u201d opinion. They\u2019re mostly a bunch of ignorant fucks who thinks their opinions matter. Unfortunately, the masses parrot what they say for fake internet points. \n\nI love musicals. Even if i didn\u2019t, I\u2019d at least watch the episode before i decided i hate it. If i hated it, the best thing i could do is not watch it again and move on with my life. The worse kind of human being is the type that spends all their time trying to convince others to hate everything as well, so they have someone to be miserable with. Unfortunately it works.",
                "It\u2019s because musicals as a whole are super divisive. You pretty much either love them or hate them. I personally don\u2019t really like them, but I think this episode could be fun.",
                "Push the envelope.Try something different. That\u2019s great!  I look forward to the episode",
                "Looking forward to this episode.",

                "Star Trek ain't Buffy.",
                "Yeah, nah.\n\nIt doesn't suit Star Trek at all. I feel this could be the single worst Trek episode from all of them. \n\nNot looking forward to it at all.",
                "I'm sure it'll be a great episode. I'm sure it'll be well written and make sense within the story. \n\nI just don't like musicals. At all. I'm sure it's my loss and all, but I'll probably just watch a review of this episode and just skip it.",
                "My hope is that they are following the 'Once More With Feeling' playbook that Buffy laid out pretty closely.   And from what we've seen so far, I think they are.  (Some weird phenomenon suddenly makes everybody sing, and thus everybody's hidden emotions leak out.  I think this will do a lot to forward a lot of the more \"personal\" lot arcs.)\n\nBuffy did the musical episode right.  I have very high hopes for this... and I think the SNW cast is much more stacked with musical talent than Buffy was.\n\nI think it also shows how much faith the producers and Paramount have in this show.  Making a musical is a huge risk.  And it is an expensive, difficult-to-produce risk.  You have all of the things you need for a typical episode, but now you need to hire extra composers and songwriters, a choreographer, dancers and singers instead of just garden-variety extras.  I wouldn't be surprised if they hooked some of the less-experienced singers up with vocal coaches ahead of time.  You need a ton of extra rehearsal time that you wouldn't need for a normal episode.  You need a bunch of extra time in the recording booth beyond typical ADR work.  And the list goes on.  Making a musical is a BIG THING.\n\nAdding a musical episode to a show I love (that I very much think can pull it off) is catnip to me.  I cannot wait!",

I adored it since it aired.  \n\n\nIm ecstatic for this upcoming episode. Anyone bitching has so much content already in this universe. They can sit down and shut up for 1 single episode.",
                "I will reserve judgment till I have viewed. However a musical episode has had its day. Its a little late. They worked well in fantasy shows as can be explained easily, such a Buffy. This is going to be an infection from a virus or something similar and just seems predictable. It just seems out of place in a scifi show such as Trek. Feel it will be style over substance. I\u2019m happy to be proven wrong but I suspect it will be very jarring. I love musicals but don\u2019t really want to see it in Trek.",

Uhura did a number in ToS, so did Spock, and then in TNG there were quite a few.  British Tar, Blue Skys, DS9 had Fever, Vic Fontaine, and Sisko, Voyager had a couple as well.  Then there was Picard's big musical number in Season 2.  \n\n\nThe episode will be a fun time that let's the actors showcase some of their talents other than pointing forward and saying \"do it\".

Anything where the people doing it are having a good time is infectious. I'm having fun because they are having fun.",
                "I like musicals, I often am not a fan of when shows do musical episodes. Biggest reason why on this isb that they often are not all the things you described as to what made Once More With Feeling such a success. For me, musical episodes seem to often happen in later seasons of a show to try and refresh people's investment in the show, only to deliver an ok episode at best with mostly iffy songwriting. They seem to view the fact that it's a musical episode should be enough and fail to stick the landing.\n\nAll that said, I have faith this episode is going to be great. So far I've only been impressed with this season. It's only the second season of the show which means the decision was made because it was showing production wanted to do, not had to do. I love the cast and even from the trailer it looks like it's actually going to advance the story of the show quite well.",
                "'I've got a feeling that it's a demon. A dancing demon, no something isn't right there.'\n\nI mean it all depends. I skip musical episodes most of the time because the actors just can't pull it off or it's superfluous, just doing a musical ep to do one with nothing real to say. Buffy could do what a lot of shows can't. It had a few silly songs (they got the mustard out is a masterpiece) but then used individual character songs to highlight their inner musings and further the plot. And it was the kind of show where something like that could happen. I guess we'll see whether Star Trek can pull it off.",

I couldn't possibly be more on board with this, especially given how SNW has done so much to earn my trust as a fan. \n\nSo, yeah, right there with you. \n\nThat said, I don't think it's constructive to characterize not being excited about this as negativity. My fellow Trek fans have been kind enough to give me grace when I've talked about aspects of Trek that weren't to my taste without characterizing me as bringing negativity to the fandom, and because of that I've never felt like I needed to engage in [Trektarianism](https://redd.it/73xx3r). \n\nIt's okay for someone to not like a thing you like.",

If it is merely a conceit, then I will be an unhappy camper - they wasted a precious episode to being precious.",

Sure, I pine a greater proportion of episodes with deep moral/social dives and hard sci-fi in the \u201ccenter of the plate,\u201d but we have so much Trek to choose from for that SNW\u2019s track record will justify it another couple of seasons to do it all.",

Not their finest episode. Was way too silly imho (still loved it coz I love sci-fi and musicals, but it wasn\u2019t that well done, mostly coz none of those guys could really sing). I think maybe some folks have bad memories of that sci-fi musical and are a big reluctant for SNW\n\nHaving said that lexx was a low budget show with bad acting and effects (and story)\u2026. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I loved it, but it is what it is. SNW has a far better team and I don\u2019t think they\u2019d do this episode if they didn\u2019t think they\u2019d do a good job",

Or was that another part of that season? Either way, OMWF works so well because like you said it pushed forward character development for Buffy.

The Buffy musical worked for some reason, so I will wait until I see this episode to judge it, but like the Lower Decks crossover, my expectations are super low. I hope it is good, but if it is isn't then whatever.",
                "Musicals rarely work in the modern era. Television (and by extension streaming) is more conservative (not in the political sense); meaning that they rarely take significant risks. SNW is still quite early in it's life, and let's be honest here Trek has never held the highest ratings.\n\nBuffy's OMWF is an example of some such thing where a musical episode works out pretty well. If SNW is aiming for that, then it might turn out pretty well. We know that Christina Chong and Celia Rose Gooding are musicians as well, and I am sure that will help though I don't know about the rest of the cast.",

At some point people will lock into this cast and they will become iconic television, being season 2 we are still building characters.

I\u2019m one of the people who already know I love the show and cast, and I love musicals so it\u2019ll be great for me, but I can see potential problems for people at large.",

                "Alright, Opinion Time\n\nBest ones here:\n\nIgor/Flower Boy - Best albums I've ever heard in modern hip hop. Tyler, The Creator really outdid himself with those two. I love November, it has IMO the best instrumental between the two projects 7.9/10\n\nOK COMPUTER - No duh its one of the best ones here. This Radiohead LP is a out of body experience when you're in the moos for it. It's so uncomfortably depressing yet so unbelievably beautiful. Karma Police is my favorite song of all time. 9.5/10\n\nHawaii Part II - It's really funny that my favorite Tally Hall record is not under the name of Tally Hall. HP2 is a really good album with a somewhat depressing story. The Mind Electric is a orchestral mess of synths and classical melodies that are HAUNTING 8.5/10\n\nNirvana (Comp) - Basically all my favorite songs are on this compilation (besides the special ones on Bleach). You Know You're Right is basically Kurt's last cry for help before he offed himself and it's horrifying for me to listen to now given the context of the song. I really think this showed the highlights of Nirvana's short tenure and it's a solid Comp album 7.5/10\n\n\n(Dear reader, you can this next part if you notice your favorite album being on this one. I won't it against you. Hell I don't know if you were gonna read this all)\n\nMy least favorite:\n\nWeezer (Blue Album) - When the album is good, it's fine. It's a blend of sad boi emo with the charm of those 60's britpop bands churned out by the record labels at the time. When it's horribe, it's almost embarrassing. But it's almost  never horrible so I don't actually hate it that much. But still, the album is like below average for me (4.3/10)\n\nThe Normal Album - You'll need to pay like a whole bunch of money to get me to listen to one song on this album fully. I really despise this album for the same reason I despise AFYCSO by Panic! at the Disco: It's annoying, pretentious, and trying to do something \"different\" by doing a style that has been used to death and wasn't cool even when it started. Will sounds like he's constantly trying to mimic that one guy from Oingo Boingo. When he's not singing like that, he just sounds like the male version of Demondice. And the instrumentals aren't doing the project any favors. It's an annoying flashback to the trashy 50's Doo-Wop genre (he even sings like a Doo Wop backer in two songs) and it's just really obnoxious. (2/10)\n\nYFM - I grew up listening to Your Favorite Martian, which at the time was retired so I thought the band name was \"THIS PROJECT IS RETIRED\". Half of the jokes I didn't get so I thought they were pretty good. I also loved and still love RWJ's content so it was kind of natural to like the project. When the project came back last year, I decided to revisit it. Holy shit, I actually can't believe I liked this stuff. Most of the songs are horrible and unlistenable. The vocal delivery is trash and RWJ, as much as I love him and his content, is a god awful musician. (1.6/10)\n\nJoe Hawley Joe Hawley - I just can't listen to this album. Not because of Joe Hawley, I'm a firm believer in separating the music/art from the musician/artist. But because of how lame and boring most of these songs are. I get that some of these are joke songs are supposed to be funny. I just can't actually perceive anything on here as funny. It's a god awful attempt at comedy. It's sad thought because most the serious songs on here are actually really good. Aristotle's Denial, Bahamian Rap City, and Rotary Park are all really good and are definite standouts in the album. But the rest of the album is so bad, these barely do anything to save it  (3/10)\n\nI love music and talking about it. I just love listening to music and seeing what I think of it. I even like talking about music I don't like since I could hear what others have to say about it and maybe I'll change my views on it. Not here to hate on your music taste, not am i also here to praise it as the god of all music tastes. But it's an interesting list nonetheless.",

Deciding if it should have any is the first big step, I would imagine.\n\nI routinly go back to the Half-Life/HL2 sound tracks.\n\n[Like this track from HL2. You can't tell me you aren't having a good time when it starts playing.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImDxuy371zs)",
                "Hollow knight, stardew valley, and far cry blood dragon have the best soundtrack in my opinion",
                "heck yeah the music is important. It sets the mode for the game. Just try playing some games without the music. It may still be fun, but that mood factor will be gone for sure.\n\nAs for my favorite, Bloodborne's soundtrack",
                "All listen to is mostly video game music.",
                "Music is very important in games to fill out the background in more silent moments and for seeing tree tone and atmosphere for the game. Bloodborne soundtrack.",
                "Music in video games is very important. It can enhance the experience and it can downgrade the whole thing. When it hits right it\u2019s one of the best experiences you can have.\n\nHere are some that I think are awesome:\n\n\u2022 God of War trilogy\u2019s music is fantastic. It matches the epic-ness of the gameplay and visuals. \n\n\u2022 Ocarina of Time & Majoras Mask\u2019s music are wonderful. There\u2019s a certain whimsical and melancholy mood the scores provide.\n\n\u2022 GTA V score is great. Clearly influenced by Heat, Thief, and To Live & Die in L.A. (among others) the score is cool, steel, and sets the tone for when the game can go full satire and serious on a dime. \n\n\u2022 Skyrim\u2019s score is wonderful as well. It\u2019s a score that can be epic, but also very somber. Like the game itself, it allows the gamer to live in its world. Very similar to Skyrim, I\u2019d say BOTW/TOTK also has a beautiful score that just melts itself in the world it inhabits.",
                "Extremely important! Celeste, Hollow Knight, Aeterna Noctis, Oblivion, etc. All these have soundtracks that stand on their own, and that elevate these games to artistic status",
                "Yes. Objectively. \n\nGames like Doom, Elder Scrolls and Subnautica are vastly improved by the soundtrack. Removing it would knock at least a full point off their score imo. Especially Subnautica.",
                "Yes. Anything by Uematsu. He's a master.",
                "Genshin Impact has some excellent music.  I often play with headphones just to get immersed in it.  \n\nThey have pulled a lot of influence from other RPGs that came before it as you can easily hear elements of games like Final Fantasy, Chrono Trigger and Zelda.",

                "Depends on the game, but I find music important in any story-based game",
                "Yes. Who wants to fight a boss to dull music? Doesn't have to be some hype bombastic piece too.",

                "Fuck yeah it\u2019s important",

                "That's like asking if music is important to movies. To me it's very important. What better way to punctuate a scene than with a powerful score?",
                "Starcraft 1/Brood War. Diablo II, Act I specifically.\n\nSkyrim of course.",
                "Old Minecraft music and red dead 2 music",
                "Rome Total War\n\nOne of the most popular mods for Rome 2 is the one that adds the Rome 1 soundtrack. Which tells you a lot about both soundtracks.\n\nMusic is incredibly important. Great music is one of the things that makes games memorable.",
                "Depends on the game, but in general I think it is.  It can help show importance of moments, hype you up for boss fights, create an eerie scene, and more.  One of my favorites is from Destiny 2, the Deep Stone Crypt raid.  There\u2019s a song that plays after one of the encounters called Deep Stone Lullaby and it\u2019s the best original song I\u2019ve heard from a game.",

                "Game music is very important. Silent Hill 2 I'd say like 80%-90% of the horror is due to the soundtrack.",
                "Hotline Miami\u2019s soundtrack is not the kind of music I wanna listen to in general but when I\u2019m losing myself in a frenzy of schizophrenic mass murder set to an 80s vaporwave aesthetic and I need to focus on my 40th respawn of that one room it\u2019s pretty much perfection",
                "The moment you walked into Emils Hideout in Nier Automata and Kaine Salvation started playing was the best music related moment ever",
                "Yes. For me, soundtracks and sound design are equal in importance to gameplay. Your game could play like the best game ever, but if the soundtrack and sounds aren't there, then it's all wasted. \n\nFrostpunk, Outer Wilds, and Deep Rock Galactic are my favorite 3 I think",
                "Damm right its important. Soundtracks set the mood. Jet set radio future, Doom, Final Fantasy, Castelvania, all had great Soundtracks that set the mood.",
                "Absolutely. Risk of Rain 2 and literally every Super Giant game's sound tracks are just fantastic",
                "Very much so. Music and sound design go hand in hand with video games to me. All the way back to Mario, Tetris, opening chests on Zelda. JRPGs are always phenomenal, and I STILL listen to Oblivion and Skyrim OST all the time.",
                "A lot of people hit done classics but I recently played God of War and God of War Ragnarok recently and the music really hits during the dramatic parts.",

                "Music is often overlooked but absolutely essential to the feel and tone of a game. Think back to your favorite childhood games, the music starts to play in your head doesn\u2019t it? There has been some really incredible music written and produced for video games over the years, and it\u2019s literally one of the most instantly recognizable aspects of a game. If you play a game long enough, the music and overall sound design makes an imprint on you and you\u2019ll be able to recall the exact sound years later with no hesitation. The games that have the best soundtracks are usually the ones that are the most popular and most well remembered",

                "Persona 4 golden, love every track",
                "Definitely important, often underrated.\n\nMetal gear solid 4 but as a series it's spot on. The soft classical guitar melody in 4, the music when you beat sniper wolf in one (akin to this when you go back to same area in 4)\n\nNo other games music hits me like metal gears does.",
                "Good game music can make or break a cut scene or mission. My favorite track is from Ace Combat 7 Called Daredevil. At least that\u2019s what i think the track\u2019s called",

                "Video game music is a HUGE part of setting the right mood and tone for a game. The wrong music can take a great moment and render it flat, the right music can elevate a fairly routine scene to very memorable.\n\nThere are several games with music I think is critical.\n\nFF XIV - Nobuo's early contributions (Answers, Dragonsong, etc) are aome of his best work and Soken & Team have proven up to the task of following up on the legend himself. I listen to XIV music daily. Esch and Every OST has at least a few really good mood tracks, a few sad/mournful tracks, some inspirational tracks, and a few absolute bangers.\n\nXIV's emotional journey you hear so many of us talk about would NOT be the same without the music.\n\nControl - This deploys the music in a more subtle way, except for one stretch where it just blasts you with it which is really intense and awesome, but it sets the mood so well.\n\nCommand and Conquer: Red Aleet and Tiberian Sun - Given the redundancy of the gameplay loop at times, at least if you build slow and steady like me, your OST needs to be full of great tracks that can loop for 30 minutes at a time. Red Alert set the standard, but Tiberian Sun was my favorite by far\n\nKingdom Hearts - A game that brings together two beloved franchises, both with fanbases that have some overlap, but all have high quality expectations, theres a TON of preasure to get this right. I think Shimomura did an EXCELLENT job.\n\nDOOM (2016) - older shooters had great soundtracks for what they were working with, but Mic Gordon raised thr bar with DOOM 2016. From incredible mood pieces to absolute skull stompers, Mic may have delivered the most metal soundtrack up to that point and that wasnt even the original goal. Some of the craziest sequences of bouncing between unloading copious amounts of ammo and breaking demon skulls would not have been the same without tracks like BFG Division pushing thr adrenaline fmthrough you.\n\nChrono Trigger - The first game OST to really get through to me and help me understand the importance of the soundtrack, it just gave so much character to the game. Magus's theme giving you that slight shiver, Frog's triumphant march spurring you on, the smile I get to this day every time I hear Robo's theme, the game wouldnt be one of the JRPG GOATs without its soundtrack.\n\nThere are plenty more examples.",

                "Co-op shooters have been knocking the ball out of the park lately. Deep Rock Galactic has a great soundtrack with RUN! being a standout for me. Warhammer 40,000 Darktide made me realize that I like Gothic techno music. As in, techno music with gothic latin chanting. And Starship Troopers Extermination has a really friggin great extraction song that uses elements of music from the first movie but changes it in a way so that you wouldn't miss the best part due to pre-scripted dialogue.\n\nRUN!\n\nScanning Commences/Offworld Auspex\n\nExtraction",

To me it's even more important sometimes because I love music so much, it makes me feel powerful emotions and if the music sucks ass it's gonna take away from the experience",
                "To me personally, if a game doesn't have good music, it can only be an OK game at most.

It can effect enjoyment in a way that many players don\u2019t notice consciously, but it does affect their perception and immersion in the game.\n\nRisk of Rain and Risk of Rain 2 have great soundtracks and are probably my favorites for purely listening to.\n\nFor most admired, I like Age of Empires 4. Each civ has a different soundtrack for each of their 4 ages that\u2019s based on historical/cultural instruments from the civilization it represents. The music changes also changes when combat starts. I admire this games soundtrack because it\u2019s always new and changes. For each civ they essentially made 8 songs, and they really fit the vibe.",

Not to mention Calamity Mod's on original OST.\n\nOn the other spectrum, your theme is as important. Doom guy having \"kill everything that moves\" music, really gets you in the mood. You feel so powerful, unkillable, as you mow through hoards. And then you have DMC5's Vergil; no matter what you were doing, you will be motivated.",

I don't know how you can oversell.  You'd expect them to have some sort of deal on paper with JYP/Jihyo saying she will sign X amount of albums and that's it.  After that is finalized, then put up the orders, not the other way around.  Unsure how this is a \"systematic\" error, when it's more of shit internal processes over at UMG lmao\n\nWhatever, this is probably the last time I'm buying directly off UMG, I half expected this after the last time with RTB.  If it's a signed album, I'm just going to get it elsewhere since the shipping speed is also trash as well from UMG and on top of that, because I tried to buy two sets for my friend and I, the shipping they charged was no different than if I had imported the albums myself.",

                "&#x200B;\n\nI don't remember records that had many garbage songs.  Many albums were based on a concept, so the songs worked together.  Most artists back then had played live for a few years before signing for a record deal.  Musicians could actually play their instruments!\n\nThe cover art was great.  I remember the covers for \"In the Court of the Crimson King\", \"Dark Side of the Moon\", \"Sticky Fingers\" and many others fondly.  The back cover usually had some text about how mind-blowing and profound the music was going to be.\n\nI was listening to music featuring the jazz drummer Max Roach.  I think there are very few contemporary musicians who can play as well as the artists of my day.",
                "I started buying 45 singles as a preteen. One Christmas, I got a standard portable tape deck. That began my journey making mix tapes. Which progressed directly onto cassettes when I bought my rack stereo system. Then, from CD to cassette, then digital to CD. Now I just build playlists on my phone. I made hundreds of \"mix tapes\" over the years, and now it takes minutes to do something it took hours to do before.",

                "On behalf of artists, in most cases no artist thinks they are releasing garbage songs. Often the song that becomes a hit is a surprise to them and not the one they would have expected. Every song is like a child to them, so they can't really tell which one is the best.

But yeah, you're gambling with your money that you'll like anything more than the song on the radio.\n\nAs a kid I was scared to listen to other songs on the album. Why? I don't know.\n\nThat's why compilation and greatest hits albums are or were a big thing. Here's a bunch of songs you know you like without garbage you've never heard before. I do miss those commercials on TV, honestly.",

There was no previewing. \n\nSo much of life was a mystery back then. \n\nIf you wanted to know literally anything you had to ask someone and take their word for it or go to the library. If neither of those panned out then fuck right off, you\u2019ll never know the answer. And there ain\u2019t shit you can do about it.",

                "Yes. But it was different. Albums weren\u2019t just a group of songs. Albums were meant to be listened to straight through. It was a journey. People got together to listen to the new (somebody) album like it was a movie. You all just shut up and listened for an hour.\n\nIf there was only one good song then you would typically just buy the single. Singles were actually like 3 or so songs: the hit and then a couple of bonus tracks that weren\u2019t on the album.",
                "As others have noted, most bands sold singles, because it simply was more profitable. But there were exceptions. Led Zeppelin didn't release singles because they knew that people would buy the album.

                "I don't think I truly felt \"old\" until I read this post.\n\nBut yes, pretty much so. That's probably why a lot of us took advantage of Columbia House and BMG. If you didn't like the entire album, at least you didn't spend a whole lot on it. \n\nThere were also 45s and cassette singles, but that would generally only be whatever single was released plus a \"b\" side.",

                "Some of my favorite Tom Petty songs never got air play. I mostly bought cassettes at the time. \n\n\nWhat do you buy now ? Do you download just one song from an artist or the whole album ? I still buy the whole album",
                "You're looking at it all wrong.  \n\nYou might buy an album for its hit song, but you listened to the entire album, both sides -- first song to the last as the artist intended.  \n\nAnd while you were listening, you smoked a doobie with friends and passed around the album cover and read ALL the footnotes and credits.  \n\nIt was an immersive experience.  Listening to random cuts of \"Dark Side of the Moon\" or \"Frampton Comes Alive\" makes no sense. You had to listen to it in its entirety to really get it.",
                "Here's the thing:  Sometimes, if you give the whole album a listen now and then, you'll learn to love or just have a change of opinion about those songs you previously thought were garbage.\n\nYou could also lift the needle up to skip certain songs and drop it back down on the song you did want to listen to.  Be careful though, you can scratch the record if you're not!",
                "I'm thinking this has to be a joke. Do you think you could offer to buy only the song you liked. It's a physical product, you can't sample a thing. The same thing applied to books. You couldn't say I only like Chapter 10 do I have to buy the whole book? Now everything is singles and I miss sometimes hearing the less well known songs. One of the all time great albums was \"Dark Side of the Moon\" by Pink Floyd. There are singles on it but I think if you took any song away it wouldn't be nearly as strong. It was on the charts forever and I just heard it's almost 50 years old. I don't think they'd even attempt it today and I doubt the record would want to release it. Sometimes artits need room which hardly anyone gets today. Do you see any contemporary music that people will remember in 2073? I can't think of anything",
                "I really enjoyed listening to a band\u2019s whole album. You\u2019d get to know every song and come to love them just as much as the big hits. I think you really miss out on an artist\u2019s work if you don\u2019t listen to a full album.",
                "What you may not understand is there were a lot of hidden gems on those albums.\n\n\nMarketing executives pushed the most marketable song, not necessarily the best song.\n\n\nThere were also rules about song length if they wanted to get airplay on the radio.  Songs over 3 minutes didn't get played much if at all.",
                "45s. But also, there were radio stations in the late 70s that played 'album oriented rock' and the DJs would play OTHER songs they liked off new albums so you could hear them. Late night DJs would even talk about the songs' themes, or their influences, or read a poem it reminded them of. It was a glorious time for radio and music alike.",
                "That was only an issue when CDs where the primary format. \n\nCDs where about $14 for back catalogue (oldies), and $17-$21 for a current popular one.  When CDs were first released, everyone complained about the cost, but the companies assured us that when they became more popular, the cost would come down. Of course, that never happened. \n\nDuring the CD era, the music companies were notorious for putting one good song on a $17 CD.  Singles weren't much of a thing, because they also cost $5. That's one of the reasons illegal downloading became a thing.  The companies believed they had us trapped. \n\n(Also, they got into the bad habit of putting a remix on the radio as the hit, like \"The Mummer's Dance\" by Loreena McKennitt and \"Sweet Surrender\" by Sarah McLachlan, that were not on the CD album.)\n\nTheir ultimate downfall is they never had cheap singles available like vinyl 45s or single cassette tapes. It was sheer greed, because once there were enough CD mastering plants, production was as cheap as it used to be for 45s and cassettes. Everyone learned how to pirate as soon as they could.",
                "How it worked was you went into the record store and the clerk would open up the album you wanted.  You would indicate which songs you wanted to buy and he would put deep gouges in the tracks of the other songs so you couldn\u2019t listen to those.  That way you only paid for the songs you wanted.",
                "Music was curated then.\nThe cream rose to the top.\nThe garbage sank fast.\nNow, with streaming and YouTube, the garbage is everywhere.  Good albums don\u2019t exist any more, only good singles.",

To party!\" Rap/mix didn't exist in the rural Midwest. Many people bought the CD expecting it to be all hardcore rock, and I guess, the band even had beer bottles and \"booos\" thrown at them when they first toured this area.\n\nHowever, a few others really got into their other songs, style of music. My own son (now in his early 20's) said he and his buddies in their frat like throwing the CD on during parties, everyone knows the lyrics and gets hyped.",

                "I grew up in the CD era, so 45s and even the cassette singles had stopped being a thing in my teens. But you _wanted_ the album. There was more discovery that way -- for most bands, the song that hit you hardest wasn't the one that was on the radio or had a music video, it was some deep cut, and when you found someone else who loved that not-hit song, they were immediately your friend.\n\nI'm still getting used to the change that followed. Like there's a big hip hop artist I keep an eye on and every month there's news that he's got a new release. My reflex is always \"He put out _another_ album?! He just put out one last month!\", forgetting that these are just tracks.",
                "OR buy a 45.  Not all songs were just on 45\u2019s tho",
                "There were 45s",
                "Yes.  But the album artwork was also highly anticipated.",
                "Yes, because there was no way to prevent you from listening to the other songs on an album. If you were lucky, the song you liked was released as a \"single\"; then you were only paying for one additional song you might not listen to.",
                "There is nothing I miss about vinyl LP records.\n\n- 23 minutes per side, so 46 minutes total, max. That's why LPs look so stingy these days.\n\n- You pretty much bought them without hearing any of the music first.\n\n- Fragile and easy to danage.\n\n- Had to flip them over to hear the whole album.\n\n- Can't skip the inevitable crappy song.\n\n- Bulky to store and move.\n\n- Sentisitve to heat, dust, vibration.\n\n- Needed to be mindful of your record player, too. Had to replace the needle. Belt drive record players would slow down as the belt stretched.\n\nNothing about them was good, except it was the only way for a long time. Both 8-track and cassettes were worse, but at least they worked in a car. I switched to CDs immediately once they came out. My entire old record collection that took 3 big boxes fit in one CD case.",
                "Yes, and a lot of times you wound up liking a song that they didn\u2019t play on the radio or that you didn\u2019t know existed.  So it wasn\u2019t all that bad.",

Sometimes you would find other songs you ended up liking on the album. But yeah it was pretty annoying to have to pay so much for a whole album filled with mostly songs you didn\u2019t care about, and this was a big reason pirating music took off in the early 2000s.",
                "In my small town a 45RPM single cost $1 and I\u2019d go to the drug store and pony up about half my weekly allowance to buy something epic like \u201cThe Locomotion\u201d by Grand Funk Railroad.",
                "That's why musicians with a couple of good songs sold really well, and some known musicians managed to get hits out of mediocre songs.\n\nWith a cassette in the car fast forwarding and rewinding was rough.  Some cassette players could even detect the end of a song and stop automatically.",
                "Well, yes. I have albums that I bought for one song and regretted it, immediately. I didn't tend to listen to pop but alternative (college radio person), and it was the 80's, so singles of what I wanted weren't available.",
                "You could get singles, like 7in or 12 in\n\nI never bought 7in singles though. Full albums were the way for me",
                "Yes, and this is why musicians were panicking when people first started streaming music. They knew they only had a few hits on each album, and feared they would lose a lot of money if people could just stream those few songs individually without having to pay for all the other tripe they padded the album with.\n\nPeople could always buy singles if they just wanted one song, but a lot of people would buy the whole album in the hopes they'd find something else worthwhile, or just because they were a diehard fan. Buying an album has that element of surprise that adds mystery to the purchase.\n\nListening to singles was a pain back then because you had to get up and change the record after every song. At least if you put on an album, you could listen to it in the background while you did other things. I honestly don't think I ever purchased a single, for that reason. It was just too much trouble to keep changing the record.",
                "This was the case for CD's and cassettes as well. They did make singles for them but most of the time we would save up for the whole album. \n\nDigital music is such a blessing. Either just buying the individual song cheaply or having a streaming service. I use YouTube Music.",
                "Albums were shorter back then so they had to prune the list of songs to what made it on the album which meant more good songs than not. Every album I purchased I bought because I was a fan of the band and would play the album all the way through. Often the \"hits\" were not the best songs on the album. The more you heard some songs the better they became. For example \"Tom Sawyer\" was a hit for Rush but there are better songs on moving pictures.",
                "Define \"garbage\".  \n\nWhat you got on those albums were deep cuts.  Stuff that didn't get played on the radio that was so good.  I recently rediscovered Journey of the Sorcerer on an old Eagles album.  \n\nSome albums were set up as a whole piece of work, not just a collection of songs.  Most of the prog rock bands were like this.\n\nThere was plenty of dreck of course, but those gems in the corners of the albums.   Mwah!",
                "When it was cassettes and CDs it was a real problem because those things were kind of expensive and when the rest of the album sucked it was a real rip-off.  You could still occasionally find singles on cassette, but then you had to dub it onto a mix tape or it was a waste of time to even play it.",
                "Some kids ridicule boomers for not being tech-savvy or wanting to grow with the times. I love it that I can go on something like iTunes and sample 10 songs and maybe buy 3. I suspect artists used to go ok I only have 1 good song but here's a bunch of stuff that passes as music to make an album.",
                "I had to look at some comments first to make sure ot wasn't trolling,.no offence lol\n\nTo me that was part of the fun, you discovered what you like and as someone else mentioned, albums were pretty cheap.\n\nFirst album I bought with my own money was when I was 13, it was THE Edgar Winter Group with Frankenstein on it and I bought purely for the cover, I didn't know any of the songs till I walked home, put it on my little record player and listened over and over until I knew every word to every song, except Frankenstein of course, no vocals lol. I was so happy that I ended up loving almost every song.\n\nIt was an adventure in a way, picking an album not knowing what I was getting and almost always loving everything. I did go to the rock section until I discovered punk, then I had to switch record stores, finding punk stuff was harder but easier to get 45s.",
                "You had to buy the whole album unless the song was released as a single, usually on a 45 with an A side (popular song) and a B side (not popular song).\n\nThat\u2019s why when iTunes first started selling music by the track it was considered a game changer.",
                "Yup.",
                "Well, there were singles: 7\" singles (sometimes called \"45s\"), 10\" singles (the same size as 78s from the 40s and 50s, and pretty rare in the 80s) and 12\" singles (the same size as an LP, which DJs would use because they had dance remixes on them). \n\nOf course, the song had to be released as a single for this to work, but often a band might include unique songs on the b-sides of the single(s). Early Duran Duran was my first favorite band, and the b-sides of their first three singles - \"Late Bar\" (from \"Planet Earth\"), \"Khanada\" (\"Careless Memories\") and \"Faster Than Light\" (\"Girls on Film\") - are some of my favorite Duran Duran songs.   \n\nThere were also cassette singles (\"cassingles\"), CD singles and \"flexi discs\", which were thin records made out of acetate (the same stuff [overhead projector](https://www.bing.com/images/search?q=overhead+projector+&form=HDRSC3&first=1) sheets were made out of). Flexis were sometimes included in magazines, or were given away as cereal box prizes or with Happy Meals or as fan club promotions.\n\nCD singles tended to be a rip-off as they were often $5.49 (and up) for 1-2 songs. Import CD singles were even worse: $12.99 and up for 1-2 songs. But sometimes these were the only way to get certain songs on CD. For example, until 2002 the only way you could get the *original* version of Madonna's \"Into The Groove\"^* in the USA was on the UK *Like a Virgin* album CD ($35-$45), or a German CD single ($12.99 and up).\n\n\\* - \"Into The Groove\" was remixed for Madonna's [*You Can Dance* remix LP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Can_Dance). All subsequent CD versions of the song (*The Immaculate Collection* and *GHV2*) were based off that remix. In 2002, Warner Bros finally released a \"deluxe version\" of *Like A Virgin* that included the original mix.",

                "No, you bought a 45 (smaller record with one song on each side).",
                "Although as others have mentioned buying singles was a thing during the records era, things unfortunately went backwards and singles really weren\u2019t a thing during the CD heyday. \n\nYou could borrow CDs from friends and make mixtapes or make mixtapes off the radio, but you were stuck buying the whole album if you really wanted that one song.",
                "You'd buy the 45 (small record) which had your favorite song on side A, and a not so famous song on side B.\n\nBig surprise sometimes when side B turned out to be more popular!",
                "No, singles were still put out, usually on 7\" vinyl. And when cassettes came along, so-called 'cassingles' were part of that action. And the same with CDs, though 'CD singles' usually had at least three tracks. (The others usually had at least two.) Modern CD-EPs are more or less descended from that.",
                "We could listen to just the song we liked. On a turntable you could lift the needle arm and place in to the song you wanted to hear. On a cassette or 8 track you just fast fowarded to the song.",
                "Yes.  In the 60s and 70's, if the song was a popular single, you could buy it as a small 45, which had the \"hit single' on one side and some other song on the back side.   45's were more popular with kids, but as I got older,  I wanted to buy the entire album, because I wanted to hear what else the artist had done that I might like more.  Sometimes this did suck, because the other songs were nothing like the single.   But sometimes the other songs were all amazing - like Neil Young's Harvest, for example.    Also,  your albums were a way to show off what kind of music you liked and what kind of person you were or were pretending to be.",
                "FM had no rules... for a while. you could hear a lot of different music, call the station on a *landline* and ask about the song. Go to record stores and poke around. There were ways to find out about everyone from ABBA to Zappa, if you were determined enough.",
                "Depending on the artist, often a song that was not played on the radio ended up to be a favorite of mine, because it was so rare to hear anything but the popular songs. It's still like this today.  If the rest of the songs sucked, you were just out of luck.",
                "We also had Columbia record club, for only .99 you got 18 free albums , but you only pay shipping and handling.",
                "Yep.  I recall buying the Beatles \"Help\" album and it had some great songs on it but a lot of \"musical interludes\" that were totally worthless.  \nEDIT:  I just found out today that these worthless interludes were placed on the Help album by the U.S. record company that distributed The Beatle's records.  They also reversed the cover image where The Beatles were using semaphore spell \"Help Us\".    They watered down LPs and used the deleted songs to make another album for more profit.  McCartney learned about by accident some time in the 1980's.",
                "Well most of my favorite songs from all the albums I bought were not the hits. The people making records were mostly real talented musicians. I liked to try new things and would take a chance and buy albums from groups I didn\u2019t know. I was rarely disappointed and never found \u201c crap\u201d on those records. \n\nBy the late 1960s and into the 70s, it was common to think of an album as a work of art and what we called a \u201cconcept album\u201d. That mostly started from The Beach Boys making Pet Sounds and was reinforced right away by The Beatles making Sargent Pepper\u2019s Lonely Heart\u2019s Club Band. Though to be fair, there were albums based on concepts before those. Sgt Pepper was thought of at thee time as the big one. \n\nAnd some of those famous albums had no hits on them at all but were thought of as great albums. A great example of that is Exile on Main Street by The Rollng Stones. It\u2019s a double album and not one of the songs on it got much radio play when it was released. There are a lot of people including music critics that consider it one of the greatest rock albums of all time.\n\nA lot of us also made it a point to listen to albums as albums, but it was not uncommon to just play one side at a time and then play another album, just playing one side. And most record players had a long spindle and you could stack several albums on the spindle. When one album finished playing, the needle would swing back out of the way and another record would drop and the needle would automatically set down at the beginning and play that record and keep doing that until all the records in the stack played. \n\nThough if you got into better equipment and turn tables on high end stereos, you did not have that stacking ability and it was kind of hard on the records. They would scratch easily and that would cause skips and pops in the play back.\n\nOP, an example of an album that most of us would listen to as a whole work is Dark Side of the Moon by Pink Floyd. If you go on YouTube you can probably find the album in its entirety. I think if you have a listen to that, you will get a good feel for what a concept album was and why we listened to it that way. If you do try to listen, I highly recommend good stereo speakers or head phones/ear buds.  And if you are of legal age, smoke a little weed before you listen.",
                "Many, many times. Very rarely was every track on a whole album great. Sometimes we would buy singles (at exorbitant cost) for that one song. It's also why mix tapes were a thing.",
                "On a band that I had never heard of, I had a two good song rule. I had to hear two good tunes before I'd buy the album. If the album was good, I'd generally buy the rest of the library, at least until they put out a crap album.",
                "Red card \ud83d\udfe5 for inappropriate use of *So* and *like*",
                "Cassette tapes were awesome for those songs. Either a friend had the album or the radio station would make it clear that the next song was X and lead in with 2 seconds of silence",
                "The record industry of the late 20th century is a subject for books, not reddit posts.  \n\nTo some degree, yes, you would buy an album based upon a single hit by an artist or group, and sometimes the artist was just a one-hit wonder and the rest of the album was just bad. However, mostly you'd buy an album based on your respect for an artist as a performer - someone established as a quality musician or group. Those albums were full of \"deep tracks\" and \"sleeper hits.\"  \n\nA good example of the single-hit album is Don McLean's \"American Pie.\" Everyone bought the album based on the (IMHO highly over-rated) title song, but \"Vincent,\" the 3rd song on the album, became a hit after the album's release. Most of the rest of the album is just OK.  \n\nAn example of a quality band releasing an album that spawned hits is \"Van Halen.\" Their first album received just token record company promotion, but developed into several hits. Most early buyers probably bought it because of radio play of \"You Really Got Me,\" a cover of a 14-year-old Kinks hit. The radio play usually included the mind-boggling intro solo \"Eruption,\" which preceded the song on the album. If you wanted to hear this version of the song you had to buy the album, because the 45 didn't have \"Eruption.\" The song's billboard rank of 17 is based on mainly the 45 sales, so don't reflect the reality of it's popularity. Anyway, the album just kept producing hits, and there aren't any cuts that seem worthless or uninteresting.  \n\nAn example of a known entity releasing albums full of hits is any Beatles album.",
                "Music has been commercially available for purchase for well over 100 years. For most of that time, yes, you bought an album if you liked a song. Unless there was a single, but personally, I'd rather have the album.",
                "Or you borrowed the album from a friend and record it on your cassette player. Listen to it on your walkman.",
                "No. There were 45's.",
                "45's was one hit, and one  unheard of. Tape was how Playlist were implemented.",
                "Yes, and you were hopeful that you\u2019d find a hidden gem among the other, unknown songs.  Sometimes you would, sometimes not so much.  It was still fun, though",
                "I grew up in Southern Ohio and we had several FM album rock stations that played the WHOLE album, so you knew what was on the whole album.  The whole album was a 33 and  1\\3, which meant the record revolved 33 and 1\\3 times a minute.  Then there were the singles (45's), which had the A \"single\" hit that was being played in AM radio and a B \"flip\" side.  So for $1.59 you could get the single instead of $8.95 for the whole album.  The really neat thing was, from the mid 70's to early 80's there were certain artists who just put out wonderful albums, not a bad song to be found.  We didn't mind paying for the whole album.",
                "So, kids, do you ever buy an old double vinyl album and wonder why the first record has sides 1 and 4 and the 2nd record has sides 2 and 3?",
                "Yes and it wasn't unusual.  As already noted, we had 45s, which were just smaller records, but the hole in the middle was larger for some reason.  So you'd have to slide a round thing over the spindle to play 45s.\n\nIt seemed to me that most people would buy the entire album, rather than 45s.",
                "Yeah.  Same with tapes and CDs.  Some stores let you listen to albums before you bought them.  I liked the ones where you stuck your head into a big dome to listen, instead of using headphones.",
                "On the subject of mix tapes:\n\n--Using a stand-alone tape player sat right close to the radio to record something, and hope you could time it right at the very beginning. You could always rewind if you didn't hit pause quick enough at the end. But holy dyin', nobody better talk while you were recording. This method also worked for TV shows, but you had to make sure you had the 90 minute tapes so you didn't miss anything flipping it over. \n\n--Using a radio/cassette player, man, that was a game changer. No external noise! When they came out with dual cassette decks that was SO COOL. You could tape off a tape. Very handy if you were a boy trying to impress a girl. Bonus points for radio/ dual cassette/record player.\n\n--You hoped you could get a copy that someone else had done to save you the trouble\n\nOn the subject of records:\n\nI had a few 45s, I think my first one was *Rainbow Connection*. I would've been in grade 3. I also had *The Tide is High* ... no idea what others I had were. Records I remember having were Air Supply (not sure which one, I think *Making Love out of Nothing at All* was on it... great content for a middle schooler), & *Thriller*. I must've had others but I can't think what they were. I had plenty of cassette albums, and when CDs came out it was seen as a bit of a fad that wouldn't last.",
                "Singles are literally the first form of records. They used to have 78 rpm records that were not vinyl. They originally had one side if I recall. I have a number of them from my grandfather. Old jukeboxes played 78s and went to 45 rpm singles because they were more durable. My grandparents owned a bar and I got the old jukebox when they closed it up in the late 60s. We\u2019d also get the 45s when the guy came out to reload with new ones.I think we paid like 10\u00a2 for the used ones. I had literal crates, hundreds of singles.",
                "Not at all.\n\nThe system has actually not changed all that much, actually.  Only the media have changed.\n\nIt used to be that musicians would record songs, and if one seemed likely to become a popular earworm a label would select a recorded take of the song suitable for promotion.\n\nThat would be released as a \"single,\" which was a dumb name because the vinyl disc --being two-sided -- would have the hopeful hit only on the main (\"A\") side, and some totally other random thing on the other (\"B\") side.  So they should have been called \"doubles\" but nobody did.  They were also called \"45s\" because they typically played at 45 rpm, and also \"7-inch\" because that was typically how big a disc a \"single\" was.  Seven inches across.\n\n(The song \"Brimful of Asha\" references this repeatedly in the lyrics, including with the chorus:  \"Brimful of Asha on the forty-five.\")\n\n(The release of these singles was a multistep process whereby a final engineered master copy was selected and sent to factory production at a record plant, often to be shipped thence directly to the retail shops.. this is called \"drop shipment\" and the point at which the master received the final sign-off and the contents of the single was no longer in the hands of the musicians or the producer was when the record \"droppped\" -- a term we still use, albeit meaninglessly, to this day.)\n\nSo singles would hit the record stores, where people would hear them being played, and want to buy them.  They would also hit the radio stations and be broadcast live over the airwaves, on rotation according to an arcane and often quite corrupt decision-making process that was heavily influenced by what the labels wanted to see succeed.  (This is of course where DJ comes from -- disc jockey referring to proficiency selecting and cueing up vinyl discs for live radio play.)\n\nBut radio stations also took telephone requests so they had an independent metric for figuring out if a single was really a hit or not.  And so there was this big feedback cycle of promotion, radio play, DJ request, store purchase... and big charts published in print magazines so everyone knew what was popular at any given moment.\n\nIf all of that sounds remarkably like streaming, streaming services promotion, bit rates, likes, and in-app purchases for individual songs... well, it should.  The modern digital music landscape has been intentionally shaped to be as close to this familiar old model as possible, by the music industry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo anyway musicians would release singles according to some record label marketing person's idea of what sequence and timing would make the most money, and after a certain number of singles had gone out, you'd decide that you'd gotten as much out of that process as you could, and it was time for the next phase.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt was then, and only then, that a full album of songs be released, in the form of a larger vinyl disc -- the \"twelve inch\" or \"twelve inch long-play\" format (12\" LP).\n\nOften, while the initial singles were in circulation, the final album would still be in progress.  It was frequently a very dynamic process, despite all the convolutions and formalities.  Album versions of hit tracks would often be different from the 7\" version or the radio version, since those would have been engineered and edited for those specific media.\n\nFinally the album would \"drop\" (although nobody outside the industry used that term back then) and then would start hitting record stores.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe idea of an album of songs where you were supposed to buy the entire album and that's how it was intended from the very start did exist.  But it was considered kind of an \"auturist\" notion that only arose into general prominence in about the last third of the 20th century.\n\nAlso it didn't help that the emerging new audio cassette tape format didn't really lend itself to the \"singles\" / \"albums\" dichotomy... cassette singles did exist but the concept had lost a lot of its power.  Personally I think it was partly because the \"auturist\" idea had become more mainstream, and partly because of technology -- if you only liked a few songs on an album you now could trivially select them out onto your own mix tape that you recorded yourself.\n\nWhat we didn't know was that cassette tapes and their successor, CDs, were all going to end up being a flash in the pan, before digital download took over and basically returned us all to the way things worked in the era of vinyl, with listeners being able to pick and choose if they wanted individual single tracks based on what was popular, or get the whole album if they wanted to hear something new and more complete.",
                "You bought 45 singles and stacked them on your record player so you could listen to your favorite songs.",
                "Yes. You could buy a single or listen to the record first at the store. There weren't many albums filled with junk. They tended to have a theme so a lot of albums were very well thought out. Pop albums were more risky but some of my favorite songs were the B side of a single or the rest of an album.",
                "For most of us, we had cassette recorders, so we'd either buy the record and record what we liked, or borrow the record from a friend and record what we wanted. I personally bought a lot of used records, also. Or sometimes even recorded songs off FM radio.\n\nBut I actually preferred to have the entire album. I didn't really listen to groups that only had one good song most of the time. And even if I did, I'd listen to the whole album and often get to like others. But even now, I don't only listen to the first song I like over and over, because then I'd get tired of them all and have nothing left to listen to if I can't keep finding new songs I like. \n\nAnd many times, I don't even like the most popular songs very much. Many times I need to hear a song a few times before it grows on me.\n\nI have never bought a single 45 rpm record.",
                "I hate this question.  Yes! Of course!  But you didn't know that! That's why you bought the album, to find out! And the production quality and song writing quality were much much higher pre-streaming, because if it was terrible after a ton of people bought it, they'd never buy another album of your again. There was almost no do-overs.  Streaming ruined music and creativity and completed the music industries villain arch of total corporate take over and mass produced garbage.",
                "Yes you bought the whole album and were screwed if the rest of it sucked, BUT it was great when you discovered an album loaded with good songs. Songs you\u2019d never know by listening to the radio.",
                "Yeah and a lot of times you didn't find out the album was shit until you had it at home.",
                "I use to buy a lot of 45\u2019s for a whopping 49\u00a2 a piece.  I bought albums too, but for $5.99 each I had to do a lot of babysitting to afford them. Honestly, I don\u2019t recall buying many albums that I didn\u2019t like/love most of the tracks. As a teenager in the 70\u2019s my record collection included (to name a few) Elton John \u2018Captain Fantastic & the Brown Dirt Cowboys\u2019 \u201cGoodbye Yellow brick Road\u2019 (they were my favorites). Also had Foreigner, Kansas, Boston, REO, Supertramp, AC/DC, Led Zeppelin, etc\u2026. My brother recently resurrected his old Kenwood turntable & connected it to modern speakers. I was seriously awesome  listening to vinyl again.",

                "Yeah",
                "Yes it worked that way. Though usually the lead song came out on a 45 (smaller record with only two songs, one on front and one on back) if your were lucky you could get that.\n\nI think all the junk songs on albums is one of the reason's iTunes was so popular.",
                "Yup.\n\nI remember buying the buggles album and feeling like I won the jackpot. Every song was awesome.\n\nBut some albums were a bust.",
                "They never had 10 garbage songs lol.",
                "Either that or wait for the radio station to play the good songs.  You could call and request them, too, then sit by the radio hoping to hear it, and bonus points if they said your name before playing it.",
                "If you couldn't afford buying the lp or a lot of 45s, the next easiest way was to buy a compilation lp. You'd get a bunch of hits, so more bang for your buck. K-tel, Ronco, etc... all the hits of the day or if you wanted okder hits, then \"Golden Oldies\" compilations were available too.",
                "Records and tapes had singles (45 for records) where you\u2019d get two songs. Generally the popular one and one that you might have heard on the radio. But yes\u2026 if it didn\u2019t come out as a single or 45 (record) you bought the whole thing.",
                "You could buy small records, called 45s that only had one song on the A side and another song on the B side. \n\nThe A side was the song being released. The B side was just a filler. Occasionally disk jockeys would play the B side on the radio and it would take off.",

                "No.  A lot of singles were released...45s, we called them...and I actually liked a lot of the B sides (usually just another track from the same LP that wasn't expected to do as well), and many was the time I did end up getting an entire LP.

                "There were 45 records, where you could purchase a record with just one song on each side. Usually these were reserved for the big hits. Record companies didn\u2019t make 45\u2019s of every song.\n\nHowever, albums from bands that had a hit (or not) usually contained many more songs that were also excellent. It was a thing where you were respected if you had deep knowledge of the entire catalog of any particular band. There was no Internet, so it was not easy information to obtain.\n\nThe radio DJs that were famous in the late 50s, early 60s were famous because they went deep into the tracks on albums, and picked out the real gems that hadn\u2019t made the Billboard top 100. You listened to these DJs also, because of their deep knowledge of behind-the-scenes information. Additionally, their transitions between songs were an art form. I know it sounds crazy, but being able to artfully blend the ending of one song into the beginning of another, takes a lot of skill.\n\nIt\u2019s not like how it is today. There were late night FM radio shows that literally had no commercials. You could listen all night and hear entire albums that you didn\u2019t own, and you didn\u2019t have to pay for it. It was all free.\n\nTo me, it was the golden age of rock \u2018n\u2019 roll, and contemporary music in general. It saddens me that we will never see that again. \n\nFuck Broadcast Architecture for ruining the music industry.",
                "No. The guy in the store just took a scissor and clipped the song you liked out of the record and sold it to you.\n\n\n\nOfcourse you had to buy the entire record!!!! (ffs**)",

But once in my life I saw a show literally stop, rewind, and redo a song scene, and then do it two more times. It was the 1966 revival of the 1946 musical Annie, Get Your Gun  \u2014 with Ethel Merman\u2019s reprising her role as Annie despite her age. Irving Berlin wrote a new song for the revival, \u201cAn old-fashioned wedding.\u201d  I saw the performance in Washington, DC on the way to Broadway and the crowd was STUNNED. Cries of \u201cencore\u201d stopped the show and they redid the song. Then the same thing happened two more times. My most memorable evening for any musical.

It was absolutely fantastic.\n\nI saw it on tour in Philly earlier this year, and I feel like they changed some things around (five years later, and it wasn\u2019t even an established show then, so it\u2019s entirely possible). But that number didn\u2019t seem to have the same juice and just raw output this time around as it did the first time.

Classic musicals can elevate melodrama stories into theatrical experiences, making stories like My Fair Lady, Fiddler on the Roof, or The Sound of Music grand-scale tales about whole societies despite literally being about individuals and families.\n\nThis is a really long way of saying, no, I do not think a pure Batman musical would work.

I can\u2019t even relate to him personally on the track, but the depressing delivery of his verses and the atmosphere of the track are so heavy my emotions just give up completely. \n\nU is another one for me. I too struggle with loving myself and self guilt, so to hear Kendrick put himself on blast so thoroughly gets to me on a deeper level. \n\nThe last two don\u2019t make me cry but the relatability is a refreshing sadness if that makes any sense. Real is just about loving yourself the way you are and not feeling forced to be someone your not. Feel is just an isolating track when your stuck questioning if there\u2019s anyone out there that really cares about you, or in Kendrick\u2019s case, \u201cain\u2019t nobody praying for me\u201d \n\nMaybe in just an emotional mess lol but what about y\u2019all?

My favorite songs are: Wings for Marie 1 & 2, Reflection, Invincible, and Third Eye.\n\nNIN is just plain sexy. Same as with Tool, I prefer the songs with a more industrial psych rock vibe than heavy rock.

It seems like most people don't really care as long as I'm not like, blasting it at the beach or something. It totally embarrasses my kids though. lol",

Really appreciated those parts of the show. \n\nMy favorite band was (is) Every Time I Die then they broke up. 3/5ths of them recently formed Better Lovers & I fuckin love what they are putting out. Just saw them on Monday & I got to release so much frustration in that pit. \n\nI also love Slipknot, KoRn, Deftones, He Is Legend, Glassjaw, Suicide Silence with Mitch.

                "Ugh, not sure what to think of the normie comment. It took me ages to realise that metalheads have some of the toughest gatekeeping in place and in some instances, especially guys are more close minded when it comes to music than some technomaniacs.\n\nI guess it depends on the country, but at least where I grew up that was the case. And as I grew up with this music and wanted to fit in hard, it took years for me to get over looking down on people who listened to mainstream pop or didn't have solid interest in music in general.\n\nSo no, I've never been closeted at all, but my views on music changed greatly with time and my tastes vary pretty much daily. Still my spotify top genre is alternative metal, but I also love me some funk or good old soul, or newer indie or alternative, some IDLES or the Cure, or Depeche Mode, basically I let my mood decide what I listen to. I also started to love dance music, some heavier house, or deep dark techno too. There's so much stuff to explore. I don't like being considered a metalhead or a rock chick even (there's not much rock-rock I actually enjoy, more grunge if anything, Blind Melon and Days of the new are such underrated bands, or prog / whatever rock like Kyuss, Soen, Leprous, Katatonia, old Anathema), same as I wouldn't call anyone with milder taste in music a normie.\n\nI still love me some NIN, Tool, APC, Deftones, Korn, Death, Opeth, Slipknot, Sepultura, Disturbed, Machine Head, Strapping Young Lad, Ministry, Refused, At the drive in, RATM, Type o Negative, Sick of it all, Dog eat dog, Converge, Cult of Luna, from newer stuff I discovered Defeater and picked some more hc / punkish songs I vibe with for a playlist but I also love so many other and more chill bands nowadays I just can't keep up with metal / heavy music and there's other stuff I'm into. Dethrone was the only song I could get into from Bad Omens (still love it), but there seems to be a trend now for melodic autotune amongst new numetal or metalcore bands that I just can't enjoy.",

I would consider myself a quasi-metalhead.\n\nHowever, overall my taste is pretty eclectic. I love 90's grunge and alternative, progressive, psych, jazz, blues, rock, older country (think Johnny Cash era), folk like Leonard Cohen, a little pop, etc...I know I'm forgetting a lot. I recently saw a fitting meme that said \"I like many genres; I'm polyjamourous\". Lol\n\nI don't honestly know why, but metal in particular just makes me really happy. And I'm not secretive about it at all.  I really don't care what others think of my taste. I don't necessarily always LOOK like I enjoy the sort of music I do (sometimes I do), so occasionally someone will be pretty surprised, but I don't think I've ever had an outright negative reaction.\n\nMy husband loves metal too, and we've seen some great shows.

Favorite bands are Emperor, old Dimmu Borgir, Windir, Abigor, Vital Spirit, Shores of Ladon, Dissection, Goatmoon, Drudkh, Hate Forest, Burzum, and Blut Aus Nord. I also like some doom: My Dying Bride, Draconian, Paradise Lost, Opeth. Then I also like some more rock type stuff like Tool, Metallica, and Danzig. Also, melodic deathmetal: Night in Gales, Dark Tranquillity, At the Gates, Gates of Ishtar, In Flames. \n\nWith blackmetal in particular I would say I listen to it almost like I would classical. I am obsessed with the movements, the rhythms, and the melody, I find it all to be so soothing but at the same time extremely energizing.

I listen to a lot of power pop now, which can be similar to early punk and I really enjoy it. \n\nI have been shunned by other women a lot, unfortunately, and in my experience it boiled down to me not being a very girly or feminine woman. I'm pretty rough around the edges, and even though I've been told I'm really nice, I think I just have a personality that's difficult for other women to relate to. I also feel very solid in my personal identity, and that can throw people off as well. Like, I'm not trying to upstage anyone or show off, I'm just confident in who I am and how I express myself.

It has been really cool to read through some of the responses on this thread, though, as it has jogged my memory on a few bands I had forgotten about recently, especially Norma Jean, Strapping Young Lad, Cult of Luna, Kyuss, DEAFHEAVEN!?!? Honestly, who forgets about Sunbather?? So, thank you for posting it!\n\n\nOne track I will always return to if I'm looking for heavy is a Dillinger Escape Plan song that was a limited release and is not on Spotify, or any streaming services. I can only find it on YouTube. It's called Happiness is a Smile and I would highly, highly recommend it to anyone who appreciates heavy. I tweeted to ask them to put it on Spotify but no joy yet, haha.\n\n\nSo a different type of heavy I've been appreciating lately is Amyl and The Sniffers, and The Chats. Super high energy punk vibes. Something totally different for me.\n\n\nI don't think I can add any metal bands to the thread that nobody else has already mentioned though. Maybe I would add McLusky into the mix on the post-punk/post-hardcore front. Death From Above 1979 and Black Rebel Motorcycle Club for everyone appreciating the sexy Deftones vibes. \n\n\nThe Prodigy have always been a heavy band for me. One of my favourites, saw them live more than I saw any other band. Along this line I'd maybe add in Pendulum, and then for something a little bit different Angerfist for gabber/hardcore which totally gives heavy. \n\n\nUnsure if I remember seeing The Oh Sees anywhere, throughout the thread? Or the Mars Volta? Definitely saw At The Drive-In, though. \n\n\nAlso, I also don't remember seeing My Chemical Romance and come on now ladies, let's not pretend that Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge isn't a 10/10 album. The White Stripes have also always provided some cool rock vibes in the area of heavy. \n\n\nI have thoroughly enjoyed this. Thanks!",

I felt like it was addressing things outside of myself and forcing me to consider the \"bigger picture\" of the world. \n\nI then discovered Cattle Decapitation which is heavier and harder hitting than Gojira and I realized that their music encapsulates a lot of what I feel as a human. There's a lot of anger and sadness about how humans take a lot of things for granted, a lot of the theme is we're destroying the world, enslaving animals and there's way too many mindless people out there. The rage and sadness I feel is almost beautiful in away because it makes me want to be a better person and to take the hurt away that people experience in life. It's hard to put into words.

The rest is history.\n\nTo this day, Recovery is one of my favorite Em albums just because of the time period and people I used to listen to it with.",

During writing this I'm beginning to remember music I used to listen to when I was young young. I liked a lot of Em. Crack A Bottle, Ass Like that, We Made You, Drop The World, Talking To Myself. I remember watching the video to We Made You and liking it a lot. Christ almighty, dude had a completely insane run. One of the GOATS without question.",

I listened to the song on repeat for 2 fucking days without even knowing the artist name (as english is not my first language) and memorized all the lyrics , almost failed in exam because I didn't study at all.

So 2010 fully got into Eminem, listening to Eminem I\u2019ve learnt a lot not just rap, but English itself. Like I didn\u2019t even know what a metaphor was until I started listening to Eminem. 2014 came along and I went to my first concert, seeing Eminem, then again in 2019. 2013/14 he went back to blonde, and then 2019 he had his beard so happy to say I\u2019ve seen slim shady and weird beard Eminem.",

I was about 9 at the time, and I only really liked how the song sounded, but as the CD went on, I found myself enjoying a lot of the songs. In particular, I remember hearing the album end with When I'm Gone, which really made me see how versatile Eminem was, considering Just Lose It, Guilty Conscience and Mockingbird came just before it. \n\nFrom there I sort of forgot about Eminem until MMLP2 came out and I heard Rap God and Don't Front. From there I worked my way back with his discography and became the Eminem fan I am today.",
                "There was a period of time when I was around 8 when my dad (recently divorced and split custody with my mom 50/50) wanted to try to connect with me better and was making attempts to expose me to cool current music since I was mostly a nintendo geek and didn't really have any kind of musical taste yet. He bought me a few CDs like Hybrid Theory by Linkin Park and some other less relevant radio rock like Saliva and POD and I liked all that a lot. Pretty safe stuff though I guess.\n\nAnyway we were in the car with one of his friends and they were discussing whether they should show me Eminem or not. I was super curious and insisted that they play some for me so they put on The Real Slim Shady and I was hooked lol. I remember being so tuned in but I was a child and very gullible so I couldn't tell Eminem was joking when he said \"Dr. Dre's dead\" \ud83d\udc80 (I didn't know who Dr Dre was but I fr thought he locked some guy in his basement and starved him lmao)\n\nAfter that I heard bits and pieces of the MMLP when my dad would play it with his friends but I never listened to it in full until a couple years later when TES was out and he took me with him to buy it. I listened to TES a lot when I was 10 and went back to MMLP (I don't think he really cared what I listened to by then haha)\n\nBy then Eminem was so inescapable on MTV, I had seen all the music videos and saw 8 Mile in theaters. If you weren't around in this time period it's difficult to explain exactly how big of a chokehold he had on pop culture. By the time Encore came out I had gotten savvy with limewire and had downloaded SSLP and all the leaks, diss tracks, Devil's Night, everything. I was all in. Then Curtain Call came the next year and it seemed like he was retiring, then The Re-Up and hiatus and it felt the best dream ever was ending way too early \ud83d\ude2d\n\nI know I got a bit off track from OP's question but his music really shaped my adolescence more so than any other artist and it felt like losing your best friend when he said he might not come back to music around the time Proof died. I was halfway through high school by the time Relapse came out but I feel like I looked around for Eminem news almost every day during that hiatus. My music taste had evolved completely by then but there was still an itch that only his music could scratch and I'm so so glad he made it through all his struggles to continue blessing us with incredible projects that have kept me hooked to this very day!!",

It was during the time of \"Recovery.\" Tracks like \"No Love,\" \"Not Afraid,\" \"Mockingbird,\" \"I Need a Doctor,\" and \"Beautiful\" were among the first few that I loved and that got me into Em's music.

They are just curious musicians!\n\nI personally would not consider it spam or self-promotion if you decide to include a link to your music when you post a photo of your synths, I click them every time. I do not know how others feel about this, it's just my opinion.\n\nEdit: I just wanted to add after seeing a lot of posts, not even complex jam videos, just a Soundcloud link is enough for me personally!

A lot of us are low level hobbyists and the overachivers here can sometimes yuck our yums.  \n\nLastly I feel a lot of people confuse playing with performing. I really enjoy playing my synths.  I never have and never will want to perform for people or care if they thnknim good or bad.   Its just my blow off steam hobby and I'm not alone in that onthis sub.\n\nBut I do agree with the OP, for those who are looking to share their music, go for it.",

Maybe 1% of people will be curious 'what you do with them.' \n\n'Jam posts' do not get a lot of engagement because people don't want to listen to an open mic night.\n\nThis is why on Youtube videos have to list all the gear used to get viewers - because what eyeballs there are are far more likely to be people trying to hear a demo of a particular piece of gear rather than some rando's noodling.",
                "In most instrument subs people \\*love\\* it when you ask them if they have some links to their music. The thing to remember however is that in this sub many people basically are **not** musicians in any reasonable sense of the word, they simply love the technology, the knobs, the blinking lights. Which in itself is perfectly fine; people should do with their disposable money whatever makes them happy (within legal limits :P).\n\nThe problem becomes that 1) these people tend to be quite aware that they spend a lot of money on what are essentially musical instruments without having any musical skills to speak off, and 2) some people without expensive gear tend to be jealous/offended by non-musical people having a lof of cool gear. These people will sarcastically ask for samples, basically \"calling their bluff\".\n\nAnd as a result, many people here tend to regard the very idea of genuinely asking for links with great suspicion. As people already in this topic say, they think it is 'passive aggressive snark', a sneaky attack on the person posting their gear pic or such.",
                "Totally agree! It's not the best but I will start the ball rolling here's mine [SoundCloud ](https://on.soundcloud.com/19AUf)\n\nLink now works lol. Drunk posting is fun",
                "> but my point is I really hope people aren't offended if people do ask\n\nIt just needs to be understood that there are _polite_ ways to ask and _impolite_ ways to ask. Some people around here can be snarky, passive aggressive, or hostile.\n\n\"NOW PROVE YOU CAN PLAY SOMETHING YOU POSER\" is a totally different vibe than, \"Hey cool potential here- do you have anything posted we can listen to?\". Even if, ultimately, they are the same request, one is more offensive than the other. People tend to not want to engage with people who are rude to them as opposed to people who approach in genuine interest and kindess.\n\nFor anyone who isn't getting what they want out of this sub, you have to ask yourself what _positive_ vibe and effort are you putting in so you can see what you want to see?",
                "I mean I like to hear music too, but to me the \u201clet\u2019s hear your music\u201d comment is this sub\u2019s equivalent of yelling \u201cdo a kickflip\u201d at a random teenager skating or \u201cplay Freebird\u201d for guitarists lol.",

                "It's never going to live up to the expectations and it never ends well.\n\nThere's a point where your setup can be nice, but not too nice, otherwise the pitchforks come out. It's not exclusive to reddit, either.\n\nWhen the amount of money spent exceeds a certain amount, you expect to be blown away accordingly by the end result. That's very likely not going to happen.\n\nI mean, Junkie XL and Hans Zimmer have both studios that make the impressive ones here look like amateur hour, and it's not like their music blows you away that much; it's mostly the combinations with the visuals and composition skills, but it's not amazing feats of synthesis.\n\nThe only thing that's required to get a nice setup is money. Not skill, not whether you deserve it, whether you're going to make a masterpiece or whether you can use it to the fullest - just opening your wallet. Buying is the part of the process that requires the least effort. It's the least interesting bit.\n\nBut it is the most visual bit.

                "I'd much rather keep the model where people share in comments or DM when asked. Mostly because I fear that a lot of the really cool discussions about gear could easily drown in an endless stream of people posting barly relevant content just to plug their music. Maybe I'm wrong, maybe I'm not. There are still other places on reddit and the internet in general for that.",
                "did someone tell you it was rude to ask",
                "It's not that it's rude. It just some people will be dicks about it because they are trying to call out people like me who love buying gear and maybe tinker around but never actually make any music. It's a form of trying to be a bully. I used to make music in a band way back in the early 2000's when I was younger. But I'm older now with a much larger wallet, but much less free time. So I buy some expensive gear and keep adding to my \"studio\". And at best I turn the stuff on every few weeks and make some cool sounds. In the past 2 years I have maybe ONE rough draft of an actual \"song\" I was working on. Some people, generally look down at people like me because maybe they do make lots of music but don't necessarily have the funds to buy some of the big, newer synths and see it as unfair or what I do as a big waste. But for me personally ever since I was a kid and my dad was in a band in the 80s, I have had a huge fascination with electronic that have lots of knobs and buttons and make cool sounds...Sometimes I feel bad I don't actually make much music now. But I come to terms with what I am, someone who loves collecting some cool things, knowing maybe in the short term future I may actually have time to actually use them for their \"purpose\".\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9bb2ucvqgxhb1.jpeg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1eb51479d5d3e1b609c55d5a7185c8725c70c499",
                "Honestly, I never investigated recording music because I could never super wrap my head around a DAW. I thought about getting a hardware recorder, but never got around to it. I am a very hands-on person, so the tactility of synths is really what drove me to this hobby in the first place when I stumbled upon a video of Dataline killing it on some Elektron gear. \n\nAlso, I\u2019m 90% certain that anything I make sucks. Whenever I click on some posts from people in this sub and others, I\u2019m so happy for them and their ability. Then I get super deflated cause I feel so crappy in comparison. I never felt super driven to post anything, because I didn\u2019t want to get ripped to shreds. Not saying everyone would do that, but the internet is a wild place lol.",
                "Producing songs is a whole different thing than playing synths.",
                "If people don\u2019t realize the passive aggressive, snarky nature of \u201clet\u2019s hear your music\u201d which usually is only asked like that when someone posts an obviously expensive setup, then I don\u2019t know what to tell you.  The confusion seems disingenuous at best.",
                "I honestly think sometimes it\u2019s snarky or hostile, but imagine this scenario. Your neighbor (for example, me) has a Ferrari in their driveway. You\u2019d be like wowie gee nice car !  Where you taking it?? Down the raceway or something I bet!

Synthesizers have many uses, including sound design, programming, electrical engineering, audio engineering, artistic expression, and more. People don't need to justify their purchase of synths to anyone else by publically proving musicianship. Some buy synths to play music, some enjoy experimenting with sound, some like to create oscilloscope art, some study and build synths, and some collect synths as a hobby. When people ask for music, they look to invalidate others' reasons for ownership. This line of questioning needs to be revised.",

But I do think one\u2019s appreciation of synths grows the more one learns about music and actually playing. I think what happens here is that you get people with very expensive rigs posting pictures, and then people asking for music out of curiosity and to an extent, to \u201ccheck\u201d if these people are posers, collectors or musicians. The people with really expensive rigs who don\u2019t actually play their instruments then get upset and feel liked they are being attacked, but really it\u2019s their own self-consciousness about these expensive things they don\u2019t actually use.\n\nAs mentioned, I think collectors are perfectly valid, but at the end of the day, these are musical instruments. If you are fully into the collecting hobby and know a lot about different editions, makes, keep your gear in excellent conditions and so on, but maybe don\u2019t play it much, fair enough.\n\nBut there are some people who just like buying expensive things and I struggle a bit with them.\n\nIf I was in someone\u2019s place and I noticed they had a really nice 15k+ piano sitting in a corner, and I realised they didn\u2019t actually play the piano beyond picking at some white notes, I would think that was weird.

I've mostly been playing live and haven't recorded anything since the winter. That means my xpander hasn't been played in like 6 months, because I don't use it for live shows.\n\nNow when it comes to people with tens of thousands of dollars worth of gear who post \"check out my setup\" in a way that is clearly seeking attention, I think it's completely valid to  prod them. I'm not exactly wild about people who have a mancave full of moogs and oberheims that never get played, but ultimately, if you're quiet about it, nobody really cares.

They had 14 seasons and almost all seasons were amazing. Us also, with here and there but the vision is lacking. I mean we have huge infrastructural support no? Still we are struggling.\n\n2) I've been listening to a lot of independent Pakistani Artists/Musicians/Singers lately, thanks to the last season. Artist like Talha Ajnum, Maanu, Hasan Raheem, Abdullah Siddiqui, Fariah Shafi and many more. They are coming up with bangers, super lyrics, great music and budgeted videos. Makes a lot of noise and stays with you forever. Why are we left behind in the game when it comes to Indie Scene as well?

Off all the music you have created, can you give us a top 3 favourite works of yours?\n\nI personally love, LOVE \"Ik Dafa\", everything from the song to the video.\n\n2.) Another question would be, do you listen to Independent Artists like you, Indians specifically? For the past few years, this has really caught fire, and we (my generation) started appreciating them a lot after Honey Paaji's International Villager. Unfortunately, the band culture could not really pick up in our country as it did in Pakistan, but independent artists are something I hope get appreciated in the long term.\n\n3.) I love Pav Dharia and Anand Bhaskar Collective, quite at the opposite ends of the spectrum sometimes, but they are both great in their own right. Have you listened to them?\n\n4.) Lastly, with whom did you have the most fun working/collaborating?\n\nThank you for doing this, and stay blessed!",

            "title": "AITA for sleeping in the guest bedroom after my husband continues to take showers at 3AM with loud music",
            "selftext": "My husband has started working night shifts (8PM - 3AM) over two months ago and has since been using our en-suite bathroom for showers after work. This would have been okay but he plays loud music through the bluetooth speakers and claims he needs it to wind down. \n\nI\u2019ve asked him repeatedly to use the shower downstairs and have even set it up for him with the same products he has in our en-suite. I\u2019ve  been using the bathroom downstairs every morning so I don\u2019t disturb him while getting ready for work but he refuses to do the same. \n\nSince I\u2019m a light sleeper and after being sleep deprived for so long I decided to sleep in the guest bedroom yesterday. He claims I\u2019m being petty and should talk to him about this as opposed to sleeping in the guest room. The thing is I have tried talking to him about it but I usually don\u2019t bring up the discussion as / when it\u2019s happening and prefer to do it the next day after work so I\u2019m not upset and can have a rational discussion. \n\nHe\u2019s been going around telling our family and friends and they all think I\u2019m being petty. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m doing something wrong / how else to go about dealing with the situation. I need to know if AITA. \n\nSorry for any typos / formatting \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc my brain refuses to function when I haven\u2019t had enough sleep!\n\n\nUPDATE: to the kind people of reddit, thank you so much for all you suggestions! I love my husband but sometimes being petty pays off. Sorry for the long post! \n\nI started the morning at 5:30 with a quick run on the treadmill (our home gym is right next to our bedroom. Thank you thedartofwar for the idea!). This poor guy woke up and practically ran into the room thinking someone\u2019s trying to break in. He looked TERRIFIED! \n\nHe was confused / concerned as opposed to angry when he was questioning what I\u2019m doing and if everything is okay. I told him I\u2019m too tired due to lack of sleep and didn\u2019t want to drive to my spin class. I thought it\u2019s a good idea to have a quick workout at home to wake me up and stimulate endorphins. Either he was stunned into silence or was too tired to put up a fight; it took him a while to ask how long I planned on working out for. I said 45 minutes and didn\u2019t catch the response he mumbled as he was leaving. \n\nI finished my workout at 6:15  and had a smoothie hoping he\u2019d fall asleep (if he hasn\u2019t already) before hopping into the shower and carrying out phase two.\n\nWith doors locked and the volume set to what I guess he usually listens to music on I put my playlist to work (I now realise that you can\u2019t really hear the music with the speakers outside the shower unless the volume is relatively high). \n\n30 seconds in to the first song plays (Awaken by Dethklok, thank you Jackisntasquirrel!) I hear knocking on the door. I figured I could use the music and shower as an excuse to claim I didn\u2019t hear it later! This increased to banging calling out to me by the second song (So you die by bloodbath, thank you drfstich!) and by the third song (die mf die by Dope thank you Horror-Commission656) there was complete silence. I think he only stuck around for so long since heating up another room might have taken a while. Thank you for everyone for the music suggestion, I wish he stayed for the whole playlist \ud83d\ude05\n\nBy the time I\u2019m out of the shower our bedroom is empty. I found him watching TV downstairs.  \n\nHe asked me why I would do this when I know he\u2019s just finished a long shift and hasn\u2019t had any sleep. told him I thought it was acceptable since he does the same thing. Like most commenters pointed out, the whole situation shows lack of care and I was curious why he doesn\u2019t care and what caused him to change so drastically because he usually isn\u2019t like this.\n\nAfter a lot of pushing he finally admits that he likes our conversations after work and figured if I was up, we would talk. ( I don\u2019t understand how this is the thought process of a grown man). He claims he didn\u2019t realise it was an issue for me because I haven\u2019t been as angry about it (here I was thinking the situation required patience and understanding\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f). \nI also realised he\u2019s still grieving his grandmother\u2019s death (she passed away in April). They use to talk on a daily basis is and he hasn\u2019t fully accepted the loss and processed it in a healthy manner. He\u2019s open to the idea of getting therapy to process the grief. I don\u2019t think this excuses his behaviour but it does explain a lot. \n\nGetting back to the showering at 3am; we\u2019ve agreed on the following;\n- he will use the shower downstairs after working night shifts. \n- If he wants to use our shared bathroom (it has a jacuzzi) he will text me before I go to bed and I\u2019ll sleep in the guest bedroom\n\nI realised I was pretty much doing this to myself after the first week. I have learnt that I don\u2019t owe anyone comfort at the expense of my well-being and shouldn\u2019t have let it go on for so long. Yes, he\u2019s immature and childish but I\u2019m hoping we can work on it together. \n\nThank you to everyone for their suggestions and concern! I understand all couples face challenges, these incidents in isolation doesn\u2019t necessarily paint an accurate picture of their relationship.  Like I mentioned in the comments he\u2019s been very considerate and loving expect for a few isolated incidents (less than 5) during the 7 years I\u2019ve known him. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s reasonable to expect someone to be perfect 100% of the time (I feel the need to point out that no one should use this statement to stay in an abusive or unhappy relationship!). \n\nIf you\u2019ve made it this far, I appreciate you! Apologies for the long post but I\u2019m lowkey proud that the pettiness paid off. sorry for any typos, I\u2019m still sleep deprived but looking forward to a good night\u2019s sleep tonight.",

                "I\u2019m on the fence. I love musicals (i\u2019m a music director for a theatre company so\u2026) I love Trek. I love musical episodes and Buffy\u2019s is a high point for me. I\u2019ve even done concerts of the Buffy musical material. I\u2019m a fan of the whole concept and I showed up for Subspace Rhapsody ready to love it. I don\u2019t pretend that I\u2019m an expert but I do make my living producing stage musicals and composing for theater and film. \n\nSNW got some things right. But overall I\u2019m disappointed in the final results. I have no criticism for the cast. Bless them they did everything right and they all fully committed. My beef is with the direction and the songwriting/arranging. \n\nThere was a lot of static choreo. Too many moments (especially in duets) where characters just stood there looking at the other character they were singing to. \n\nThis was even really glaring in solos like I\u2019m The X. Ok, Spock I need you to stand here and sing while staring into the middle distance. Now for verse 2 just slowly walk over here about 20 feet away and stare off in this new direction. Try not to move. Then slightly turn your head for this alternate camera angle. Uhura\u2019s and La\u2019an\u2019s solos were no different in their direction.\n\nThe way the songs were written did not help this. Lots of long, slow phrases which is great for pop, terrible for musicals. In duets this was painful like Keeping Secrets. Especially when the other character has literally nothing to do while their scene partner just stands there as well. Singing. I know it\u2019s a conversation, all duets are. But reference any respectable musical cause there should be movement and life.\n\nReiterating the songs are good but overall they\u2019re terrible \u201cmusical\u201d songs. Great pop songs, though. Maybe hire composers who aren\u2019t from a 90s pop band and instead hire people like Robert and Kristen Anderson Lopez who wrote for Frozen and Marvel (Agatha\u2019s song). They understand the concept better than Letters To Cleo does. As a result, Sunspace Rhapsody felt more like a series of music videos than a legit musical. Never go half-musical. \n\nOverall it felt like they didn\u2019t really fully commit to the musical concept and tried to keep parts of it grounded in reality. For me, during a song in a musical the whole environment should come alive. They could have used the ship as more of a character in this regard. Lights, color changes, movement in rhythm everywhere. Felt like a lot of missed opportunities and I wonder if the director has ever worked in a musical context before. \n\nThe producers philosophy of use of vocal tuning is unfortunate. Use it enough so it\u2019s not terrible when untrained singers in the cast are doing their parts but don\u2019t overuse it or everyone sounds like a synth. Ensemble vocals were so tightly tuned and manipulated that they all sounded like a cheap 90s vocoder. They tweaked the humanity out of the ensemble vocals. There\u2019s tried and true methods of tweaking untrained vocals in post production to blend them better than the final results we got.\n\nAll that said, How Would That Feel is a great song and Christina Chong absolutely killed it. I\u2019m Ready feels like the closest to classic musical songwriting and choreo they got but it\u2019s still missing something. \n\nI give SNW an A+ as a show but Subspace Rhapsody gets a C.\n\nEdit to add that this is just one person\u2019s opinion on the internet and those that fully love this episode are not wrong. I\u2019m genuinely happy people love it as much as they do. If enough people love it maybe musical episodes don\u2019t have to be rare and we can see more things like this.",

                "Lol nah. I didn\u2019t hate it, I was just disappointed. As a huge fan of musical theater in general, I expected more than a retread of Once more with Feeling. There were so many other places it could have, and should have, went. Plus it kills any hope that Discovery will have such an episode in its last season. Seriously, you hire Anthony Rapp and don\u2019t let him sing?!",
                "I loved it. Made me laugh, made me cry\nIt was better than Cats",
                "Did anyone else get strong Buffy vibes from this episode? When they were singing about their feelings I immediately thought of the title \"Once More, With Feeling\". Then when someone started singing \"I've got a theory\", I literally heard \"it could be bunnies\" in Anya's voice go through my head. Just an interstellar phenomenon instead of a demon.",
                "The musical was a great episode--not every episode has to be serious. In fact, it gives everyone a breather...especially the actors. the K-pop was the best!",
                "I just don\u2019t like musicals to be honest",
                "Unfortunately at least for me I just hate musicals so it was hard to watch the episode but It wasn't necessarily bad",
                "I loved the musical episode! My favorite part was when the starships danced in the finale! Lol",
                "I totally enjoyed it, but the musical episodes of both, Buffy and The Magicians were better.",
                "There have been musical moments on Star Trek before like Robert Picardo singing on Voyager or Picard & Worf trying to wrangle Data in Insurrection that I enjoy. Worf's drinking song scene on DS9. \n\nThere have been other shows like Buffy the Vampire Slayer that have executed the concept of being musically overcome very well. They did a musical episode of the Flash tapping the talents of Grant Gustin & Melissa Benoist to great effect. And don't get me started on the *many* musical numbers from the Simpsons, I got the 'Yellow' album full of them and they weren't that far into their run when they released it. So the point is I don't have a thing against singing or muscials.\n\nThe problem is SNW's campy implementation. I get ToS can seem campy being a product of the 60s but they were theatrical, not deliberately campy (like Adam West's Batman).",
                "I think it was lesser than the sum of its parts. \n\nLike they knew that people wouldn't be responsive to a musical episode so they tried their best to make it a filler episode. \n\nThe musical episode of Buffy they were clearly taking inspiration from wasn't that. \n\nIt was the episode where all the conflicts that had been brewing were forced to the surface through song. \n\nVery few of the songs actually felt like filler. \n\nOppose that to Subspace Rhapsody and....\n\nYeah...\n\nYou had two sub-plots that I was really looking forward to their being songs about \n\nLa'an / Kirk \n\nSpock / Nurse Chapel\n\nThe first while there were some songs about it the main moment wasn't even done in song. \n\nLike the writers thought it was _too important_ to be a song which is just bleh. \n\nAnd Sock / Nurse Chapel like the songs are good. \n\nBut damn! Nurse Chapels song is out of place! \n\nAnd honestly kind of makes her look like a shitty person. \n\nOn its own it's a cool song. But it's the sort of song you give a deadbeat boyfriend not one that has been nothing but supportive and merely asked why you'd ghosted them. \n\nThat could have been such a powerful moment on par with Buffy's \"Let me Rest in Peace\" or some kind of grand duet. \n\nBut instead it just feels like a random song shoved in there. \n\nYou get \"I'm the X\" later but that's kind of a small song that's really not much. \n\nWhen it comes to the main plot I feel there's no real tension. \n\nIt kind of makes sense for a Star Trek property but still it's hard to have a climactic song which is essentially \"We need to get this line up to this other line\"\n\nLike usually the big bombastic song is something along the lines of \"we could all die tomorrow so we'll sing about our plotlines\"\n\nTake Les Miserables \"One More Day\" for instance.\n\nAgain maybe I'm contrasting this too much with Buffy but there you had \"Walk through the fire\"\n\nWhich like \"One More Day\" had the characters walk into a dangerous situation and culminate their plot points around the main character. \n\nMaybe it's just that a musical really doesn't fit around the Star Trek formula but I honestly keep forgetting the climactic song. \n\nApart from the Klingon bit it just keeps on disappearing from my head it's so forgettable",
                "I didn't hate it, but it just felt like a filler episode. \n\nNothing of any real significance happened and that's just not good with these short, ten episode, seasons.",
                "No. I dislike all musicals, always have, even as a child.",
                "I don't understand your question since I'm still refusing to watch that episode.",
                "I just think musicals are mostly bad, and this one in particular was pretty bad.",
                "I liked it the first time, when it was  called, \"Once More, With Feeling,\" and it was *Buffy the Vampire Slayer*, and it was good. \n\nI applaud the daring and ambition, but not the execution. It simply wasn't a very good musical. The second a song ended, it was instantly deleted from my brain. I couldn't hum a single one of them if you put a gun to my head. I know everybody wants to love this episode, but trust me, history won't be kind to it. It just wasn't very good. \n\nThat's why musical episodes are so daring, because you're trying to succeed at two things, now: the show you're doing, and the musical you're doing. SNW doesn't always succeed at the former, so trying the latter was pretty gutsy. I wish it had worked out better. As soon as I heard the autotune, I knew the episode was in trouble, and it didn't get better.",
                "I was smiling this entire episode.  It was amazingly clever.",
                "It was a musical....strike 1.\n\nIt had chapel being a swamp hag...strike 2.\n\nIt was boring...strike 3.",
                "I thought it was incredibly well done, beautifully sang, and just a fun change of pace.",
                "I love it with all my heart, and it may be my favourite ever episode across all the series.",
                "Great episode premise, and it felt like Trek through and through. My gripe, and I'm going to get slayed on here for this, I hated the Klingon pop.",
                "I thought it was great, mostly. Most of the songs were on point lyrically and musically. Was not impressed with the finale song\u2026 went full bubble-gum pop tropes. \u201cWe are one\u201d - excuse me while I puke internally at how trite that is.\n\nBut one thing that baffled me. I get why they were singing.  But\u2026 why were they *dancing*?",
                "Is there a pun here I'm not getting, or does this statement just not make sense?  \n\n\nAlso if we're talking about why we didn't like it, how about in an episode where keeping secrets is impossible, the person with the most interesting secret (M'Benga who killed a guy last week), doesn't get a song?",
                "I hated it with a fiery burning passion.\n\nI don't care for musicals in general.\n\nThe episode being terrible to me is irrelevant in my opinion of the show, which is great. I didn't like The Elysian Kingdom either, and that's fine.\n\nI'm not at all fussed that I hated the episode. There will be others that I do enjoy.",
                "I'm dumb and don't know what this means.  X? Help? \n\nAlso, if it's about something that happened near the end of the ep, most of us didn't make it that long",
                "Just wanted to say thank you to Spock for solving every math problem ever: he is the X",
                "I still haven't watched it. I think id have to be high to get through it.",
                "I Iike musicals and I thought the music and vocal performances were good (which actors did their own vocals btw ?).., however, I don\u2019t think it mixed with Star Trek very well in terms of my expectations.  so I didn\u2019t really like it. In fact, I stopped watching about 45 minutes in.",
                "What I liked:- Star Trek is being inventive again and taking risks. I admire the creativity. \n\nWhat I didn\u2019t like:- auto tune. Great trek episode, poor musical",
                "I can't imagine hating it. I mean it's not as good as the Buffy musical but that set such a high bar, I respect the attempt from the writers to try and live up to it though, they did an admirable job. I didn't know I wanted a star trek musical till I saw it and now I want every tv show and franchise to do it. Where's my star wars musical, my law and order musical, hell if ncis does a musical episode with original songs I might actually watch ncis",
                "Two major things ruined it for me:\n\nKirk didn't have a Shatner-style solo song\n\nThe Klingons weren't doing opera.",
                "I liked the episode. The songs were mediocre and forgettable thats all.",
                "People who didn\u2019t like Subspace Rhapsody\u2026 I know their kind. They\u2019ve been in this fandom for 20 years, and they have a pretty glaring issue\u2026\n\nThey lack faith of the heart.",
                "These people don't have ears",
                "I was really looking toward to Susbpace Rhapsody, I\u2019m a big fan of many musicals. But was disappointed by the episode because it wasn\u2019t what I was looking forward to seeing or what I was expecting. \nI wanted more of the dancing numbers in the hallways, some easy-to-sing-along songs like the Sound of Music, or more varieties in theme- and more fun in the episode. But most of the songs were dramatic as the characters express in song their current emotional state (which they did explain in dialog that\u2019s how the anomaly was affecting them).  So it\u2019s not something I will likely rewatch very often, and I appreciate the efforts and taking the swing at the concept, but just isn\u2019t what I wanted from it.",

                "For the most part, I enjoyed it. It started off super strong. The songs were fun and the first few all very different from each other.\n\n\nBy no means would I say I disliked the episode, buuuuut then the songs kinda got repetitive and a little too long and it was just one on top of the other. It wasn't bad, but I was kinda like, let's gooooo already. I wanted the plot to move along faster.",

                "It's certainly standard practice with pop music. The public doesn't know this because they think all autotune is like T-Pain or Travis Scott. Most of the time it's used in a subtle way.",
                "In my experience most engineers use Melodyne or something similar for pitch correction and auto tune is mainly used as an effect, but most modern vocals are pitch corrected, yeah.",
                "Yes, people are still pitch correcting vocals.  Auto-Tune's share of the market has gone down quite a bit since there are many tools now.",
                "Is this for a thesis or something? It seems you\u2019re wanting to know about the morality behind pitch correction. I would estimate it\u2019s on just about every single track in 2023. It is extremely widespread, and people have become so accustomed to it, recorded music often sounds strange without it. Only the absolute highest quality singers can sing in a way which doesn\u2019t require it. It\u2019s just part of the sounds of music.also, the public doesn\u2019t give a shit. I saw a live version of Taylor swift singing 10 years ago, and it was extremely pitchy, but none of the commenters noticed and all had praise to sing. At the end of the day, people will like music they connect to, whether it\u2019s tuned to perfection or not.",
                "Judging by some of your responses in this thread it seems like you think this is some devious industry dark secret that we have all agreed upon to pull one over on the layperson. \n\nIt is emphatically not lol; you can consider the use of pitch correction in pop music to be 1) largely an issue of time/cost management in the studio and 2) a stylistic choice that has become culturally accepted as *the pop sound*\n\nHas it made the genre more homogenous? Potentially; though do you consider all pop music made in the last 20 years to sound exactly the same?\n\nIs it a moral quandary? Not really. The effect, conceptually, is simulating the perfect take and could hypothetically be achieved naturally with enough time for enough takes. Besides, a pop artist is very much the sum of their parts; a touched up vocal doesn\u2019t really have any bearing on their authenticity as an artist. \n\nI could definitely foresee a future where pitch correction on vocals isn\u2019t the cultural norm, but for now, it\u2019s the sound and technique people have come to associate with pop music.",
                "99.9999% of my artists are tuned on records. I do a ton of pop, big names, and even the ones who say they\u2019re not tuned\u2026 are. They honestly may not even know they\u2019re tuned, and have been told otherwise (because of ego, or whatever).",
                "most records you hear have used Melodyne. the movie industry is really bad at melodyining",
                "We\u2019ve been tuning vocals since forever. It\u2019s nothing new. It just used to be multiple tape decks with a hand speeding up or slowing down, or Yamaha spx90\u2019s tuning up or down using bypass switches. \nIt\u2019s just easier and way too over used now.",
                "In a word? Yes.\n\nAuto Tune on a vocal is as ubiquitous as amplifiers are to electric guitars in virtually every form of popular music .. from indie rock to radio pop.\n\nAt this point, the audiences\u2019 ear is so accustom to \u201cperfect\u201d pitch that even an incredibly talented vocalist is made to sound more competitive and modern by using a bit of AT.\n\nThe creative/aggressive use of tuning is employed on a case by case basis, but in general, every vocal I record or mix is getting a touch of AT. It just sounds right these days.\n\nGenerationally, zoomer artists don\u2019t even wait for me to \u201csneak\u201d it in. They prefer to track through it live knowing it\u2019s going there anyway and having the ability to sing \u201cinto\u201d it. I love this, personally.\n\nThere\u2019s no sense in wasting any energy pontificating on the virtue of not using any tuning. Anti-tuning attitudes are simply not aligned with the modern musical zeitgeist. I wish all those holding a grudge the best, but they were left behind a long time ago.\n\nAgain, from a producer/mixer perspective, this is so far beyond a foregone conclusion. Tuning vocals is as normative as tuning a guitar before laying down a take. I spend zero time judging an artist for their use, no matter how heavy, of tuning. If the music connects, it connects. How we get there is a constantly evolving practice and I, for one, am more interested in connection that any kind of \u201cpurity test\u201d. \n\nSo yeah. It is a given. Any vocal you hear in any form of popular music likely tuned to some degree.  Any exception to that is in the shrinking minority.",
                "Melodyne abuser here as well. It can do a lot to smooth out certain issues in performance. 80% use. Auto tune or waves tune only when you need that sort of effect.",
                "Nowadays, most of the time, if the public can hear it, it's purposefully being used as an effect. Unless a singer (or their producer) is truly awful, programs like Melodyne (when used correctly) are nearly indistinguishable from untouched vocals for almost the entire population.",
                "I recently heard the original Gloria Gaynor '*I Will Survive*' while driving (actual radio!) and thought to myself how it would be ruined today by auto-tune. She uses pitch inflection masterfully to keep the emotional level just where she wants.\n\nSecond anecdote: read a post here a year or so ago asking how it was possible the Paul McCartney could sing with such perfect pitch without Auto-tune and claiming there must have been some technology at play because it was impossible to sing that perfectly. smh",
                "Agree with most of the comments here. I\u2019m yet to work with a singer who didn\u2019t sound better with at least SOME vocal tuning, even if it\u2019s manually moving a single note that was slightly out.\n\nIt isn\u2019t always super obvious, the melodyne/autotune combo can be very transparent if you have a good singer and a good engineer.",

                "Even before the invention of digital pitch correction producers did correct vocals, through tape manipulation techniques. It has always been the case.",
                "Sure. After they have been passed through melodyne for pitch correction. There's a ton of it nowadays. Even if the singer is extremely good. The sound of Melodyne and autotune has become part of the sound of a modern pop vocal. As they not only pitch correct but also impart a certain sound even when used subtly.",
                "I\u2019m a melodyne user myself but it\u2019s pretty rare that I don\u2019t use it on artist tracks. Unless they specifically request that I don\u2019t use it.",

                "yes, its very common, for better or worse, most consumers expect a very perfect performance on records these days, which usually means that lots of takes will be 'comped' together (slicing things up and rebuilding them from lots of takes), these comps will then go through a bit of pitch correction (to some degree of subtlety, and depending a lot of the artist in question and the producers vision, but generally, a pop artist is going to want to be as in tune as possibe, but not cranked up all the way to artefacting and glitching), and the timings of everything will be massaged and tweaked to make the drums fall perfectly on the beat, and for everything else to lock in with it perfectly.\n\nFor some people its just a safety net, it may allow them to push themselves a bit harder with a performance, bring a slight mistake in an otherwise good take into line, or just help add a layer of polish and sparkle to things, for others, it may be doing a lot of the heavy lifting",

If a singer\u2019s been listening to a lot of pop music, growing up in the 2010's, they naturally develop a sound much akin to the sharp note transitions and formant shift that auto-tune tends to affect the recording with.",

Say what you will about its use in other genres, but its use in pop shouldn't be surprising, since pop has always used the latest studio tech and people have been whining about each new thing for as long as pop has existed. Also, it's not a bad thing. If the sound you're going for calls for a certain technique or tool, use it. If it doesn't, don't use it. Most musicians and producers know that, and I wish everyone else did.\n\nIf you want to heat music that doesn't use it or just isn't overproduced in general, listen to independent artists. People act like all music sounds the same nowadays, but it couldn't be further from the truth. If you dig even slightly deeper than fucking top 40 radio, you'll find the most diverse range of music that has ever existed.

Before tuning apps  became available it wasn\u2019t uncommon for a producer to spend hours with a vocalist on a single track. I\u2019ve done 10 hour sessions with a vocalist. Now, we can get a couple takes and then fix the few remaining offending notes rather quickly. The corrected track can also be used as a guide to the vocalist so that the finished track has less or no correction. It\u2019s difficult to overstate how grueling a long vocal session can be.",
                "I\u2019ll go slightly against the grain here and say it\u2019s not on as many records as people here are suggesting. \n\nI use it extensively on a third of records, a bit on another third (the odd note, or some bvs) and not at all on the final third. \n\nSome artists are heavily against it. Some things that sound like AT are just heavy editing and/or heavy talent. And some kids just sound \u201cAT\u201d on the mic. \n\nI make the occasional top 20 Billboard record without it and I think it definitely sounds better for it. You lose some sweet top end when you use it. And it\u2019s nothing you can\u2019t achieve with enough tracks. \n\nJust my perspective.",

                "Yeah everything gets corrected either singing into autotune as an effect or corrected with melodyne to tighten things up but not the way the general public thinks. It\u2019s still gotta be a good voice and on key etc otherwise it\u2019ll just sound like the Kanye/t-pain effect. it\u2019s just tightening things up the way you tighten up a drum performance or guitar performance, but the performance still has to be good. Autotune/pitch correction isn\u2019t a \u201chit a button, instant Christina Aguilera level talent\u201d, it\u2019s infuriating the amount of people think that\u2019s the case lol",
                "From an amatuer's pov I use auto-tune to correct small mistakes if I don't have a good take, that is pitched but sounds bad in another way. This is essential for me since I rarely have a silent house to be able to record my song, and since it's a quite mentally and physically exhausting process to record vocals, I prefer fixing small mistakes with autotune than doing it again.\n\nI don't own melodyne or any other pro auto-tune software so I use the built in one in Cubase and use midi and automation to make it sound good.\n\nAnyway, the point is that it's a time effective way to fix minor mistakes, and I don't think professionals think otherwise for pop music.",
                "These tools work live too, so it's not just recordings. Auto tune is also used in concerts. There's 2 ways to use autotune. In auto mode it detects the note you play and tunes it. There's another mode where someone plays the note on a keyboard and it tunes to that note. So in that case, you only need to speak the words \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f some bootlegs exist online of artists where that technology failed on stage and it's pretty hilarious.",
                "well, its HARD to hear yourself sing.  especially live.  and especially if you have been playing in a loud band for years!  on stage i used to have to close one ear with my hand to be sure of my pitch\n\nif you need it, you need it",
                "Idk about other people but personally, I look at auto-tune and pitch correcting as different things. Auto Tune for me is what you hear in rappers and such like Travis Scott, in which is heavily auto tunes because they are singing completely off key. Pitch correcting is just you singing a note microns off the perfect pitch of the note. Personally, i'm an advocate for the latter, but I expect people to be able to sing it 90% on pitch and we just adjust so things like harmonies sound more uniform and clearer. Usually, singing correctly and then applying melodyne just polishes the vocals a little bit. I've even used that on bass and guitars just so it's perfect in tune. It's very rare I have to pitch correct a half step for example, I would prefer having it as close to pitch as possible and then just fine tune it.  \n\n\nTo answer your question, as far as I know it's used heavily in pop and hip hop, and is fairly used in other genres but not so heavily, they rely on getting a good performance first and then pitch correct",

Why expect different for pop music? It's a manufactured performance. \n\nYou use the tools at your disposal to present the artist the best you can, for their specific context.",

                "When I listen to old pre-AT records, I hear the tuning \"problems\" FAR more than I used to. (Ex, \"Jackie\" by Sinead.) I don't like how my brain has changed, but there ya go - we're all in the same river.",

From a recording perspective it reduces the amount of recording time (and therefore money) needed, even if the artist is a good singer and with programs that work the same as melodyne you can alter vocal patterns after the recordings been made if someone wants to change it and the singers not available to re record.",

You cant get the smooth absolute perfection naturally realistically.\n\nWith some, like the Weeknd, the mixing engineer takes care of it, and with others like Justin Bieber the Vocals get sent to a vocal editing specialist who melodynes and time adjusts every little imperfection and sends it back to the mix engineer for mixing and actual processing. \n\nIts not a taboo like some people seemingly believe, and it doesnt make shit vocals sound good, you still need to have talent/skill/practice to do great vocals. Cant polish a turd\n\nPitch correction is just a tool, like compression and eq. \n\nUsually people tend to use melodyne for the transparent  correction and antares autotune for more effecty stuff, but both can do both",

                "The Grateful Dead - admittedly I don't necessarily hate the music in and of itself, but certain behaviors in the fanbase.\n\nI had a couple housemates last year who were obsessed with the Dead. One of them constantly insisted that if I listened to them enough, I would have a musical reawakening. So I checked out American Beauty and found it very bland. Not my style at all. \"Oh no, you can't go by the studio albums, their live shows are where the REAL magic's at.\" Great. So I checked out three or four different live shows. Couldn't get more than 20 minutes through any of them, just not my style. \"Oh, you're just not in the right mindset. They sound great on shrooms.\" We were in a sober living home, so obviously I couldn't do that. Every time I expressed that I didn't care for the band, they just moved the goalpost.\n\nThe other housemate was outright racist and would constantly put down black artists, particularly women, calling them ghetto and untalented. I thought maybe it was just him, but I then came across a video where Jerry Garcia smugly states that rap isn't real music, it's just talking in meter. He goes on to say that rap isn't really a skill because you can't get better at it, it doesn't translate to real musical skill. Like what the hell bro, c'mon. \n\nSorry for the rant. I want to express that, after all that, I don't necessarily hate the Dead's music in a vacuum, it just doesn't hold any appeal to me. Certain members of the fanbase, however, and Jerry's comments on rap, have led me to really detest the band overall.\n\nSnippet of the Jerry interview on rap for those interested - [https://youtu.be/VnIbSeIDSUM](https://youtu.be/VnIbSeIDSUM)",

                "My personal bands I hate, in regards to bands who have immense critical acclaim, include Nirvana (most Seattle bands, tbh) and New Order \n\n\nNirvana's music, sound, and lyrics don't speak to me at all. I don't like ugly and abrasive sounding music and I don't like any lyrics that are just whining about something over and over. I also found Kurt's sense of humor childish  and immature. Any band that has song titles like \"Moist Vagina\", \"Territorial Pissings\", and \"Rape Me\", as well as having song lyrics like the ones in \"Floyd The Barber\" and \"Mexican Seafood\" will not be a band that I like. In fact, I think that if you believe Kurt Cobain was a John Lennon, Paul McCartney, Bob Dylan level songwriter, I think you are absolutely insane and I genuinely wonder about your musical knowledge \n\n\n\nNow, New Order is an offshoot of a band I like, Joy Division, and they come from the 80s British Alternative scene, which imo, was way better than what was coming out of America at the time. I love Depeche Mode, U2, The Cure, and The Smiths, but New Order does nothing for me. They don't have the cool, atmospheric synths and samples of Depeche Mode, they don't have the youthful, energetic passion and wall of sound guitar of U2, the textured, layered sounds of The Cure, or the melancholy, jangly sound and witty, sarcastic lyrics of The Smiths. The sad part is I do enjoy a couple New Order songs such as \"Age Of Consent\", \"True Faith\", and \"Bizarre Love Triangle\", but I also believe that they're kind of weak songwriters because they have so many songs that go nowhere. Power, Corruption, and Lies is their most acclaimed album and it starts off with the great \"Age Of Consent\" and then it goes into \"We All Stand\", which is just Peter Hook playing the same bass notes over and over again while Bernard Sumner just meanders and wails. They have way too many songs like that for me to enjoy them. If I don't like the Peter Hook bassline right away, then I'm not enjoying the song\n\n\nIn fact, a big factor in my dislike of these bands is I just don't like their singers. Cobain is way too whiny and abrasive for me, I don't care about the \"rawness and pain\", I prefer my music to be lush and welcoming. But at least Cobain can actually sing because Bernard Sumner would finish 10th at a dive bar karaoke contest in a small Midwest town. He is so unbelievably flat and offkey that it ruins nearly every song of theirs. Let's be real, you rather listen to Bernard Sumner or Dave Gahan, Bono, Robert Smith, and Morrissey? 2 of those guys have annoying personalities, but at least I know they can sing\n\n\n\nEdit: You Nirvana folks are boring, can we get some New Order debate instead?",

I know he suffered horrifically with alcoholism before he was even famous and it nearly killed him. I've read about his struggle and he seems like a lovely bloke who defeated near death, beat his demons, and then forged a successful career.

It sounds like you're gonna be shopping for another DJ anyway, but these will wheedle out his shortcomings and will also be useful for the next one:\n\n- What sound/lighting equipment is he intending to bring? You're not concerned with the technical details of the answer as much as reassurance that the DJ at least has equipment and that it's suitable for the size of the room, or alternatively that the venue already has a sound and lighting system that he knows he can use (on that note, speak to the venue - they will probably know of DJs who have worked there before and can be trusted to have this part in the bag)\n\n- What music styles does he specialise in? There's no point having a Drum'n'Bass or gangster rap DJ doing your wedding, unless that's specifically what you're going for.\n\n- Is he happy to make announcements/use the mic to work the crowd? Some DJs are mic shy - that's fine for certain gigs, not for a wedding.\n\n- How does he handle requests? The correct answer to this is \"it's up to you\", but he should at least be ready for it - some brides don't want requests at all, others are fine with the DJ using his discretion and skills to handle reasonable requests. Many weddings will have a specific Do Not Play list, because they don't want to derail the party with a football song, or a dance mix of a recent funeral song being used to doorstep the first dance - consider this.\n\n- What time will he be arriving? The DJ should be there a good couple of hours before the first guests to make sure the room is ready and all sound/lighting checks are done and he's ready to start work as soon as you get there. If you're using the venues sound and lighting and he's familiar with the place, you can maybe cut that to an hour or so, but you need to be reassured that he's going to be good to go when you arrive.",
                "Hi u/GravyMaster, you've already received a ton of responses confirming that yes $400 is a red flag, and that no, it's not standard for the DJ to ask you to purchase the music. \n\nBut, I still wanted to chime in and share my thoughts, in case it's helpful: for now, or for the next time you need to hire a DJ for an event. \n\nFor what it's worth: I'm a semi-professional DJ, meaning I have a day job, DJing is my side hustle and passion project. I've been at it for over a decade. I mostly do dance parties at bars, but over the years (through word of mouth) I've been hired for a ton of corporate events and weddings, which have snowballed into even more positive feedback, and more asks to do more weddings. On average I do a couple of weddings a year. \n\nThe people who are saying that wedding DJs should cost in the neighbourhood of $1,500 to $3,000 are not wrong. This is the going rate for professional wedding DJs who come with *everything*: speakers, PA, mics, lights, the whole works. \n\nThat said, it's not *necessarily* a red flag if someone is charging less. I usually charge in the neighbourhood of $500 and up. I don't own my own speakers and board, nor do I have a car, so if I need to rent equipment (if the venue doesn't have a sound system) I'll add rental costs on top. I'm not trying to devalue the cost of a professional wedding DJ, it's just that typically the people who ask me are friends or arts workers on a budget.\n\nHowever, I bake *everything* into the cost. Including music. Here's how I typically go about it: \n\n* I'll meet with bride and groom (or bride and bride, or groom and groom) ahead of time. I ask if there are any \"special\" songs they want, such as first dance, or must hear tunes. I'll also ask what vibe they're after: sometimes it's chill laidback soul for cocktail hour, followed by millennial hits. Sometimes they express that they'll have a lot of older family in the crowd, and ask me to start with classics (Beatles, Stones, etc.) and move into harder dance material later in the night. Sometimes it's an ethnic wedding, grandma and grandpa will be there, and they *need* to hear Ukrainian polka/Serbian folk songs/insert whatever else here. \n\n* Next, I ask them to connect me with the venue, so I have a full picture of the setup: do they have a sound system, if yes what are the inputs, what cables do I need; if no, what is the layout like, what do I need to rent.\n\n* From there, I make a list. I have a pretty robust library of music already, which covers most needs, but I purchase whatever I don't have. \n\n* When possible, I try to connect to wifi, in case on the night of there's something I've forgotten, or something someone *desperately* wants to hear and I know it'll make their night. From there I do a sneaky purchase in the background. \n\nThis is how it should be done in my opinion, others can weigh in. \n\nIt sounds like your guy is a hobby DJ and not a good fit, obviously. More importantly than asking you to provide music (way too late in the game for that), I'd have concerns that buddy has no idea about sound equipment... does your wedding venue have a sound system? Is he coming with a controller, or just a laptop? Will he have the right cables? Even if he just plunked on a Spotify playlist that *you've* created and provided (in which case, surprise, you're doing his job for him), will he even have the gear and know how to play it?\n\nSorry you're in this position. If it's in budget, definitely try to hire someone last minute. In the off chance you happen to be in the Toronto, Canada area, I can recommend some people. And if all else fails, I'd be happy to help talk you through what renting an iPad/connecting it to a sound system entails, and even suggest some tunes. The latter is not ideal, but at this point, I'd wager that a well-curated playlist will be better than whatever this guy shows up with. \n\nHope this helps, sorry for novella.",

                "tell him to download TuneFab for spotify, tell him you'll pay the extra $30 for the software. give him a playlist you like.  \n\n\nAnyone who knows how to use google would have figured that out.",
                "You didn't hire a DJ, you hired an idiot. It's been mentioned already but the price tag should have made that evident. You can probably find a last minute replacement that actually knows what they're doing but it will cost you and rightfully so.",
                "Thats fucking crazy. LOL",
                "No, a proper wedding DJ asks what you want played at your event\u2026and plays it. How they obtain the music, curate playlists, etc. is up to them. $400 is crazy cheap, but you\u2019re getting what you\u2019re paying for.",
                "Oh hell no",
                "No it's a shitty scummy dj wow avoid",
                "TLDR - It\u2019s not a red flag IMHO\n\nI DJ a lot of weddings \u2014 purchasing the music to send to him is unprofessional, (maybe he\u2019s the trying to cut costs maybe since he\u2019s hooking you up?) but asking you to send  the playlist not so much.\n\nI typically recommend couples just send me a link to a Spotify playlists because most folks already have them built out and I have programs to compare it with my current library or dl from online. It helps me get a better idea of what they\u2019re looking for and edits to include when I build crates. It\u2019s frictionless\n\nTruth is we have allot of music but maybe not every song you want, and it\u2019s less tedious than having you fill out a form.\n\nFlipside - if he\u2019s planning on just running a playlist all night, find someone else. Dinner and cocktails are probably playlists anyways unless someone is diehard about manually fading background music into each other.",
                "You\u2019re getting an insane deal on cost and this guy is probably realizing that he\u2019s about to be out $200-300 if he doesn\u2019t have these songs already. I was charging $200/hr when I DJ\u2019d weddings and that was really underselling myself based on the local market.",
                "Definitely shouldn\u2019t be charging you for that. It\u2019s his job to provide music, put the playlists together, as well as take requests and play the music the bride/groom want.",
                "For $400....that's what you get. Hire a professional that's upfront about costs and options.",
                "This seems reasonable for the very low rate you are paying. People routinely pay more than $1k for wedding DJs.",
                "If he\u2019s a real DJ he shouldn\u2019t have any issue signing up for a record pool and downloading tracks meant for DJ\u2019s. He could have done some events before, but his behavior screams \u201camateur\u201d. He\u2019s going to spend hours of time to record a playlist, then individually cut the songs out? He could have taken that wasted time and watched YouTube videos of how event DJ\u2019s handle music. He could easily get a membership to HeavyHits or BPM Supreme for $8-$10 his first month and download as much music as he wants. Hell, I would have ripped songs off YouTube before asking my clients to get music for me. \n\nIf you\u2019re having a traditional wedding with party introductions you should really make sure in advance he has that part down. Maybe communicate it in advance that the wedding planner goes to get the DJ once the wedding party is outside lining up. I usually line the pairs up myself, I\u2019m the one reading them in so I like to make sure everyone\u2019s in the right order. It\u2019s also a lot of work at once if you have a different song for each pair\u2019s intro, so just confirm your DJ is comfortable with the workload of reading them in, cueing one track in while getting ready for the next one. A wedding really isn\u2019t a place to test your strength as a DJ without ample experience performing private events. \n\nIn all fairness, it\u2019s kinda a \u201cyou\u2019re getting what you paid for\u201d situation. The first wedding I DJ\u2019d I charged $700, and that is still very cheap for a wedding DJ. I\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t know what you were getting into at the time though, most people would prefer to spend the extra few hundred bucks for a more skilled DJ.",
                "Someone charging $400 is probably an amateur. Professional DJs buy (legally) their music, they don't ask their clients to pay.\n\nThey also charge significantly more than $400. I'd be interested in finding out what equipment he shows up with.",
                "Not that it ultimately matters, but how long before your wedding did you book him?\n\n12+ and doing 65+ weddings a year, I do my final consult 30 to 45 days out from the wedding, and at that time, typically able to confirm all music being used.\n\nIt's 100% your DJ's job to provide the music on their own accord unless you're looking for like a specific version of a song, or some kind of edited song, in which case sure you need to provide the file or a link to it\n\nI realize with a week away, you might not have many options, but if you have the money to spend, you absolutely need to fire this guy and get someone else",
                "If you have confidence that he can pull it off, just double his rate and tell him to figure it out himself.",
                "A good wedding DJ would be charging 400 per hour.",
                "Your fault for booking someone for $400. Absolutely insane someone charges that little.  Pisses me off tbh.",
                "Hello, professional DJ here. This guy is not a DJ. Also you should be looking at $1k for a proper wedding DJ, minimum.",
                "lol",
                "Haha hell no",
                "Huh he's not a DJ...at all. Does he even have dj equipment? Mica, speakers, etc? Is he planning on djing on his iPhone and a bluetooth speaker?\nGive his azz $100 and a plate of food he'll be happy.",
                "You get what you pay for. In our area a good wedding dj is 2500-4000 for the event.",
                "Spend the extra money and get a better DJ.... Like who ask for someone to buy their music for them.",
                "400 is not enough for a high quality dj.",
                "I\u2019ve only ever done one wedding for a very close friend, gave them the homie discount and charged $300 but I got all the music myself, MC\u2019d the whole thing, brought my equipment, we planned out the whole thing so I have a list with the whole timetable  ect. It was exhausting so I never really did it again but yeah, Sounds like a shitty DJ",

                "Not normal. Thats not a Dj. The fact that he asking you to send him music. Means he doesnt have any. $400 for a wedding?? Never cheap out on your wedding. Please find someone else. Gonna be a disaster.",
                "Not normal and this guy is probably just a bedroom hobbyist. If he\u2019s saying anything about a spotify playlist, he\u2019s a total noob.",
                "Lol...yeah I'd fire him & be ready to spend 700 to 1500 on a proper dj. Huge red flags..",
                "Lol.. that\u2019s unheard of.. but I like is boldness he\u2019s not a DJ at all",
                "what state are you in i know the best wedding DJ",
                "Don\u2019t pay $400 for a wedding dj. You will regret it. He\u2019s most likely neither a dj or wedding mc.",
                "I\u2019m a wedding DJ. What he is asking is highly irregular and laughable really but you get what you pay for. The average professional wedding DJ is 2-5k. You need to hire professionals. Especially for important events like your wedding that you will only have one chance to get right.",
                "1) unprofessional is my first thought\n\nI have never asked a client to purchase music for me. I have had clients offer custom audio files. \n\n2) asking for a playlist is low class. \n\nI have had clients offer playlists to me and I take it as suggestions. \n\nGood luck, I wish you all the best and I hope you find a DJ who will make your event memorable .",
                "Yeah if he wants you to purchase the music\u2026 triple of the price of it and deduct it from his pay :) \n\nNah. Just go and find a DJ that knows how to do their effin\u2019 job, that includes having their OWN music library.. If I get a booking for something very specific, like a wedding song, usually it\u2019s a miracle that I *don\u2019t* have it\u2026 but then again, wedding, I\u2019m charging an extra 25% on the usual booking fee anyway, i just absorb the cost.\n\nUsual booking is about $400 - but for weddings it\u2019s about $650 ~ because I *hate* the protocols, the formal wear, etc etc.",
                "$400 says it all. You get what you pay for. I\u2019ll take that for an underground gig. Weddings are 2-3k."

Usually, they are listening to Mexican music while they work, on a big speaker because there's a lot of noise from the machines, etc. \n\nOn Monday, we came into work and the stereo was gone. Halfway into the day, my boss admitted to me that he removed it from the workplace because he \"hated that loud Spanish music and it gave him a headache.\" Where we sit, we can barely hear the music and we both are usually listening to whatever we want from our computers with earbuds.

They sometimes provide a whole new dimension to certain songs compared to the \u2018regular\u2019 mix in lossless.\n\nAnd compatibility with Beats Fit Pro for the full Spacial Audio (Atmos) experience. \n\nOnly downside I can think of now; the desktop application still lacks simplicity like the iPhone or iPad apps.

So I switched to google play music. In 2017, I switched back to iOS, and got an Apple Watch, Google didn\u2019t support watchOS, CarPlay, or Siri commands, so I tried Apple Music. At the time, I think Spotify did support these things too; except Siri commands. But the ability to have personal library uploaded was key; it\u2019s what I liked about Google Play Music as well. I had some stuff that hadn\u2019t been licensed for streaming, plus other things like bootleg recordings of live shows, so that was a major factor as well. \n\nNow, Apple One keeps me here. I have a wife and two kids; we share 2TB of iCloud data, we all have Apple Music on our devices, we get TV+, and the kids love Apple Arcade. It\u2019s really a killer package if your bought into the Apple ecosystem",

But ultimately, it's because I can have more than one stream going on at a time.\n\nI like to leave music playing on my computer in the office, sometimes leave it playing on my outside patio, or I have my Homepod in the kitchen turn on NPR for my dog when everyone leaves the house. And if I listen to AM on my phone in the car, it doesn't interfere with any of that.\n\nI also get to listen to the HD feed of some local radio stations w/o downloading an additional app (looking at you Audacy) thus letting me listen to local baseball with ease.",

One of my favourites is the ability to get any device with Apple Music installed to automatically download any new songs that you add to a specific playlist either on iTunes or Apple Music for Mac or PC. \n\nAlso, the ability to have new songs you play through iTunes or Apple Music automatically become available on any other Apple Music device. Back in the Google Play Music days they had a program that would automatically detect when new songs are added to a specific file directory on your Mac or PC and would then upload those songs to your Google Play Music library, but for whatever reason Google ditched it which means Apple Music seems to be the closest alternative. \n\nSome might wonder why you would need a feature like this when everything is available on Apple Music's servers...but that's just it; Apple Music's servers aren't 100% comprehensive and honestly can't be which means there will always be missing songs and artists, so it's nice to have the option to fill in the blanks yourself.",

Apple Music only recommends very popular things it would think I like, which I often don\u2019t.

And that may very well mean I've got no taste in music, but that's OK.\n\nAll I know is that when I heard the lyrics, they were utterly relatable. I just stood there, side-eyeing my husband, who was side-eyeing me. \n\nBecause, after all, who hasn't experienced a rough and screaming, sometimes toxic, but blistering hot relationship? It's not ideal, but it happens. We've all drawn that line in the sand, skipped it over and around, and brought each other down, but if somehow, some way... you make it out on the other side...? \n\nAnd even if you don't, even if you do walk away, you *know* how it felt. You remember it all. The memories zing through you and you shudder at the curses hurled. The tears cried.\n\nSo yeah. Maybe *Last Night* is no masterpiece, but it's strummed its way to relevance with its simple but engagingly direct lyrics. \n\n*added to playlist*",

About an hour later I hear some music behind us, not very loud, but with enough bass to catch my attention.  I turn around and it's a family, a *very* large family, that has rolled a PVC based monstrosity of a cart down that contained a homemade wooden box with at least a pair of 12\" subs, a whole shitload of horn tweeters, and about 4-5 car batteries.  I shit you not.  \n\nI guess the initial music I  heard was them just warming up the ol girl, because after about 5 minutes all fucking hell broke loose.  I can best describe it as latin hip hop with a bit of house/trance sprinkled in.  I had headphones in already and i couldn't even hear my own music over it.  It was obnoxious.  Someone went and asked them to turn it down, so they turned it up more.  After about 25-30 minutes of this a couple of OCPD showed up and they shut it off completely.  \n\nI just don't understand.\n\n1.  Who builds something like that? \n2.

Ed listens to historical recordings of livesets from MagFest and DreamHack, and keeps a picture-in-picture on her monitor of a Hatsune Miku [live show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kl6S4sx42g).  Ed likes [Dunderpatrullen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6PTZED2fek) and [Pogo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAwR6w2TgxY).\n\nYes, I am 100% projecting, but I think Ed likes music that doesn't *demand* appreciation and attention, that isn't distracting in that way.  She likes music that seeps in, music that is a partner while you work, doing it's own thing beside you.  I imagine Ed's relationship with music is internet radio while working, and tabbing over to toss something that stands out into a playlist.  And it's sometimes chill, sometimes bangin', sometimes just steady getting-code-done background electronic goodness.\n\nEin?  I'm not sure Ein would have a *specific* preference.  It might be hard to develop one without the necessary agency to decide what to listen to.  I think he likes vibin' when other people are vibin'.  As long as it isn't *hard*.  Fast and loud and harsh.  No heavy metal, no hardstyle.  Chill stuff, contemplative stuff.  Ein likes Dark Side of the Moon and always panics slightly at that part in the beginning of Time.  \n\nFor Ein I think it's chill and atmospheric stuff, given the choice.  I think he likes listening to whatever Spike puts on, or whatever Ed's got going on, muffled by her headphones.  He'd excuse himself if Faye was in charge of the music, I think, and politely tolerate Jet's picks.\n\nEDIT: I'm projecting with Ein, too.  It's just that Ein is me when I smoke \"the reefer\".",

                "Well, you didn't really specify what it was you didn't quite like or think you would want your view changed about. There are many on this thread I've seen that could potentially make you feel more open about what musicals could accomplish or be.\n\n\nSuch as:\nRocky Horrow Picture Show\nOnce\nMoulin Rouge\n\n\nThere are also some that just might make you change your mind because of the sheer quality of them, irregardless of feeling different from the ones you named. This might not be the best approach as the two you said were fine are two of the most acclaimed. Still, it could be a fine approach if you're just looking for *more* musicals that are widely beloved and hoping something works.\n\n\nSuch as: \nGrease\nHamilton\nThe Sound of Music (or any of the classics being mentioned)\n\n\n\nBut it would be helpful if you specified what you didn't quite like in particular. You might get some better suggestions instead of just randomly picking out of a thread of people who are giving what made musicals make sense for *them* and not you.\n\n\nI will still give a recommendation of my own if you're not quite sure why you didn't love them, though it's leaning more into the \"pure quality\" reason. Jacques Demy is a French director and has three of my favorite musicals I've ever seen. They're all very distinct, but the genre of music is very much a throughline.\n\n**Umbrellas of Cherbourg** is what inspired La La Land, in many ways, and imo is better in every way. It is unique in the sense that it doesn't feel like a musical in the traditional sense. There aren't traditional songs that \"interrupt\" the movie. Rather, the entire movie is one continuous song and even mundane dialogue is integrated into it, though it feels natural. I've never seen a movie like it, and it might work more for you than traditional musicals.\n\n**The Young Girls of Rochefort** is either the one you'd like the least or the most. It feels most like traditional musicals, but to the greatest extent imo. I say you may like it the least because you may just not like musicals, which is very possible. But you may like it the most because it is most similar to the only two you said were fine, and I feel like it's a better version of that. So it could go either way.\n\n**Donkey Skin** is a movie that may be hard to find, but well worth it. I'd recommend going in blind, but it's both a supremely unique film on its merits besides the music, and a musical that, again feels like some of the best that has ever been done to me.\n\n\nThis might be a too much text, but it also might be helpful, because I do think some specificity is needed sometimes, especially when you're trying to find something to like in a genre you don't so much.",

Sondheim wrote the music and the words and worked closely with everyone else in the production crew so the songs in his musical really feel integral to the story and organically come about at the right moments.  They not only sound nice but they feed the audience pieces of information that Sondheim could not otherwise do trying to tell his stories without music.

            "selftext": "I'm 39M and my wife (38) and I have 2 kids. We've been together for nearly 16 years. We went to a good few music festivals together over the years before we had kids, including a couple of visits to Barcelona for Primavera Sound. For those unfamiliar with it, it's a festival held in the city of Barcelona itself - no camping, just hotel/airbnb for the weekend. The previous times we went we always rented an apartment.\n\nI turn 40 next year and I've always said I don't want a big fuss for it. The one thing I've always said though, is that I'd like to go to Primavera. Our kids are old enough now that they can stay with my mother or sister for a weekend - they all love each other big time, they both spoil the kids whenever they stay with them and the kids love going, so that's not an issue.\n\nA couple of years ago one friend mentioned wanting to go to Primavera for his 40th and i loved the idea, so since then it's the only thing I've said I wanted to do.\n\nToday my wife asked me what I want for my birthday next year and I again said no fuss. She mentioned primavera, and I said yes.\n\nShe then tells me that she won't be going, that she's outgrown it and has no interest. I told her I was disappointed, that she's my wife and the only person I'd want to celebrate my 40th with. She repeated her disinterest in the festival and said she'd \"hold me back\".\n\nLater she noticed I was quiet and asked if I was annoyed with her, I said I was because she has basically told me she doesn't want to spend my 40th celebration with me. AITA for expecting her to want to come? It's not as if I drag her along to these things all the time, it's a one off for my 40th.\n\nTl;dr want to go to a festival for my 40th birthday, wife says she doesn't want to come.\n\nEDIT: So to be clear, when I say I don't want \"a big fuss\" I mean I don't want a huge party or big deal with family and friends, I just wanted something for the two of us. I appreciate that what I want to do with just us isn't a minor thing, I just wanted something semi-casual together, a weekend of beers and music. The festival is an urban one, so no mud involved and back to an apartment at the end of the night.\n\nEdit 2: the friend who had the same idea is older than me, his 40th has been and gone. As far as I'm aware he's not planning on going next year. I literally don't know of anyone who is going to this festival next year.",

Dennis only has guilty pleasures. Genius.\n\nUPDATE\n\nFinally thought of a working definition of \"guilty pleasure\" if anyone's interested. It's anything my older brothers would have made fun of me for liking when I was 10. I no longer believe that enjoying a song is intrinsically shameful, but it personally struck me as odd that most of the music Dennis enjoys falls into that very specific category.\n\n/UPDATE",

                "I've seen people here recommending Radiohead (Recommended albums: Kid A, In Rainbows, A Moon Shaped Pool; these are the most Floydy to me I think) and Tangerine Dream (Recommended Albums: Phaedra, Rubycon, Ricochet), which I also do, but I'm surprised that no one is talking about Alan Parsons (Recommended Albums: I Robot, Turn of a Friendly Card, Tales of Mystery and Imagination), which isn't really modern but it's the closest thing to PF I've heard imo. From these classic 70's era prog I'd also recommend Camel and maybe Kraftwerk. Other than that I've heard of a band called Moongazer which unfortunately I have not given much attention yet but from the very little I've listened to them, they are very Floydy, Exit Babylon reminds me of WYWH. I would mention Steven Wilson which I really love but I think it's more similar to King Crimson.\n\nThat's for the more proggy stuff, so about other genres. I haven't really gotten much into metal but the one album that really stands out for me is Agalloch's Ashes Against The Grain; can't really say it's like PF really, but coming from someone who's favorite band is PF, I adore this album so maybe you might like it too.\n\nAs for hiphop, again I haven't gotten much into it either. Personally, I'm surprised you liked MBDTF I see a lot of things wrong about it but whatever; so from Kanye, I recommend his first 2 or 3 albums as well as the Kids See Ghosts project with Kid Cudi, out of all of these, Kids See Ghost is obviously the closest to a Floydy sound, it's quite psychedelic but if you're looking for good Kanye, imo his great stuff stopped after Graduation (Sure Yeezus sounds pretty futuristic and great overall -though it is a bit rough around the edges sometimes, feels rushed just because Ye wanted to get into the industrial experimental hiphop trend back then; and that's without mentioning the, what I call, unethical sampling techinques, basically taking songs and barely changing them, this is especially apparent here, though he has done that in the past with a Can song on Graduation and the horrendous Black Sabbath's Iron Man thing on Hell of a Life which I can only describe it as a naive parody at best and at worst complete disrespect to the original- but I'm really not a fan of his lyricism on anything from 2010's and on. Hell, I'm not really a Kanye fan either way). From other rappers, there's Tyler, the Creator's Flower Boy and Igor. But I think the closest to something like PF probably is Kendrick Lamar, especially on To Pimp a Butterfly; to me this is something like prog rap. Nujabes are also great. If you're looking for experimental hip hop I recommend Death Grips (beware, you might hate them on first listen but if you let yourself get sucked into the chaos of the music it's pretty mind-numbing, hypnotic and trippy. There's 3 types of people: People who don't know Death Grips, People who *still* hate Death Grips and People who love Death Grips. While they are far from my favorites, I transitioned through all of these phases in that order.), JPEGMAFIA and Injury Reserve; there are a lot more others which I've heard but never gave them a listen. Also, I adore MF DOOM but I don't think that's very Floydy, to me he is the rap equivalent of Frank Zappa... actually, Frank Zappa might be a good recommendation so, MF DOOM as well. Another project I recommend, not necessarily fitting in the criteria of PF-like but still great, is Cheat Codes by Black Thought & Dangermouse. As for instrumental hip hop I recommend Flying Lotus (check out Cosmogramma and You're Dead!).\n\nFrom other genres, I highly recommend Aphex Twin and Boards of Canada (If you like them, you might also like C418's Minecraft Soundtrack, don't let it fool you because it's a soundtrack for a videogame because C418 did not have to go this hard! Unironically, the best Soundtrack album and one of the best albums of all time).  Some already recommended Tame Impala and Flaming Lips. You might enjoy Animal Collective, some noteworthy albums are: Strawberry Jam, Feels, Merriweather Post Pavilion. People recommend KGLW here and I can see why, these guys do anything they want (one reason I love these guys) so there's got to be something like PF, I think maybe Changes and Ice Death Mushrooms... however it was called.\n\nWell, I'll just drop a couple of albums that you might like now, from any genres:\n\nSufjan Stevens - Illinois\n\nThe KLF - Chill Out\n\nBurzum - Filosofem\n\nTalk Talk - Laughing Stock\n\nDJ Shadow - Endtroducing\n\nMort Garson - Plantasia\n\nPortishead - Dummy and Third\n\nWeyes Blood - Titanic Rising\n\nThe Smile - A Light for Attracting Attention\n\nFishmans - Long Season and Uchu Nippon Setagaya (If you like them, I highly recommend their last live album 98.12.28)\n\nThe Cure - Disintegration\n\nKate Bush - Hounds of Love\n\nSigur Ros - Agaetis Byrjun, () and Takk...\n\nBoris - Feedbacker\n\nSweet Trip - You Will Never Know Why and velocity: design: comfort\n\nThe Residents - Not Available (maybe)\n\nI think I've gotten a bit outside of the criteria, so since I did that, while not that floyd like I highly recommend Godspeed You! Black Emperor, if you're into atmospheric music that is.\n\nI've already mentioned Pink Floyd is my favorite band, though I equally love Radiohead, GY!BE and Boards of Canada, I figured that maybe you might like something from my all time favorite albums (I'm of course excluding PF's works, but you will see albums I've mentioned returning):\n\nRadiohead - Kid A\n\nGodspeed You! Black Emperor - Lift Your Skinny Fists Like Antennas To Heaven\n\nThe Caretaker - Everywhere at the End of Time\n\nRadiohead - In Rainbows\n\nGY!BE - F# A# Infinity\n\nOlivia Tremor Control - Black Foliage: Animation Music Vol. 1\n\nRadiohead - OK Computer\n\nKlaatu - Hope\n\nKing Crimson - In the Court of the Crimson King\n\nFishmans - 98.12.28\n\nFishmans - Long Season\n\nBoards of Canada - Music has the Right to Children\n\nAgalloch - Ashes Against the Grain\n\nGY!BE - Yanqui U.X.O.\n\nGY!BE - Allelujah! Don't Bend! Ascend!\n\nSweet Trip - You Will Never Know Why\n\nSweet Trip - velocity: design: comfort\n\nGrouper - A I A: Alien Observer\n\nmy bloody valentine - loveless\n\nAphex Twin - Selected Ambient Works Vol. II\n\nC418 - Minecraft Soundtrack (Both Volumes)\n\nMicrophones - The Glow, Pt.2\n\nKendrick Lamar - To Pimp a Butterfly\n\nThe Avalanches - Since I Left You\n\nBj\u00f6rk - Vespertine\n\nHave a Nice Life - Deathconsciousness\n\nWell, I think that's enough.\n\nBut one last thing: If you haven't already, check out PF solo albums, especially Roger's, David's and I highly recommend Rick's works. Nick's albums are fun enough but nothing to crazy, Syd's works makes me depressed about what's happening with him.",

He comes home to an empty house and doesn\u2019t see or hear from her again. \n\nIt then cuts to Taylor but is years later and now she is famous. She is walking through a crowd of fans as she is going into a hotel, and is waving, smiling, and laughing.  But when she gets in the hotel room she looks sad and lonely and lays in bed. It starts to rain.\n\n All of a sudden she is at a house peeking into a window and sees her ex boyfriend with his wife and kid. I always picture them standing in the living room - he is holding a little girl and kisses his wife. The tv is on in the background and Taylor can see that a story about her touring comes on showing she is back in her hometown to perform. The ex looks at the tv, turns it off, then goes back to smiling and focusing on his wife and kid. \n\nIt ends with a close up on Taylor\u2019s eyes as they pop open as if she is waking up startled. I think my brain took the lyrics and created this character that ran away and cut all ties with her hometown and previous life, then she realizes that fame is lonely and wonders what would have happened if she stayed with him.",

First song to come to my mind is Dear Reader, so let's do that. \n\n\nThe music video would start silent with Taylor sitting on the couch, late at night, alone, in a dimly lit room, holding a drink. She turns on the TV to see the news talking about her, switches the channel to see real footage of fans excited about the Eras Tour. Suddenly she'd pause it on the face of adoring fans, and we'd see her face finally, looking darkened and sad, almost ashamed. She'd put her hand in the air as to caress their faces, squeeze her hand into a fist, and pick the remote back up. The music starts. She'd keep changing the channel and start panicking, visibly upset, but they keep being something about her, good AND bad, all paced with that rapid \"clicking\" at the beginning, until it zooms in onto a shot and the lyrics start. \n\n\nIn this, it would be recreated footage directly showing, and also more abstractly showing core (public, and private if she wished) moments throughout her life, good and bad. The main catch would be that she is standing in each room, watching her past self through her triumphs and scandals. They'd loosely represent each lyric (I could go on forever, but I'll say I imagine the first lyric, \"dear reader, if it feels like a trap, you're already in one.\" Would be represented by \"footage\" of her signing her old record deal, maybe!) Anyway, this would repeat until the chorus, where it would start getting static-like. Repeat with the 2nd verse, still slightly static-like, and then the 2nd chorus comes and it fades fully into static. \n\n\nFinally, it would zoom back out of the TV onto real, current Taylor, who would finally turn the TV off. We'd notice people are filming the video (right when she sings \"I prefer hiding in plain sight\"), she gets up & grabs her drink again, spilling it as she walks (\"spilling out to you for free\") immediately chasing multiple people to rush to clean it, as she stumbles away, looking ashamed and embarrassed. She walks to the edge of a room and opens a door (\"if you knew where I was walking.\") And enters a hallway made of glass, where she walks, light shining on her as she Is stopped and someone comes to quickly put her into a tour outfit. Finally, she reaches the door at the end of the hall, right before the bridge ends. When she walks out, the shot changes, and you see a spotlight on her, and it reveals she had just walked onto stage to start her concert. As the outro plays (\"You should find another guiding light...\") we see her performing for her fans, shots of them in costumes and screaming her name. You see the slightest bit of sadness when she looks out to them, this look of feeling unworthy, but the light keeps getting brighter, until it blinds the screen and the video ends.\n\n\nWow! I did NOT think I'd write something like this. That was actually so good lmao not to toot my own horn but like, damn. Might need to draw this ajd make it into its own post, so someone can actually see this lmao.",
                "Epiphany: \nMy husband is in the military and I work in healthcare and I always imagined a video where in the beginning he\u2019s deployed and me and my kid are waiting for him and then in the second verse it\u2019s me at work during covid and him and my son waiting and in the end we just get to all be happy together.",
                "I'm thinking about \"State of Grace\". The video will be somewhat aesthetically similar with \"Midnight Memories\" by 1D and \"Marry the Night\" by Lady Gaga, but it's just Taylor walking in the street overlooking the sea or the river. She's wearing a black leather jacket and red lipstick. There were alternating scenes of her walking around, her singing and playing the guitar on some muscle car, and her having a fun time with some guy like a flashback. The setting is in London.\n\n\"Welcome to New York\" - her walking around New York with friends, just having fun. The plot is similar to \"Run Away With Me\" by Carly Rae Jepsen.\n\n\"Clean\" - the video will be similar to \"cardigan\" but with *1989* aesthetic, like the overall color scheme of the setting and Polaroid pictures floating in the flooded room.\n\nI have ideas for \"Mary's Song\", \"Never Grow Up\", and \"Timeless\" but the videos I'm thinking of for those songs were just Taylor narrating the lyrics as it is, similar to \"Mine\".",
                "Getaway car.\n\nWe start in black and white and Taylor has brown hair and a trench coat. She gets in the car and tells an innocent looking guy to start driving. As she hides the money but enjoying it. Not to mention she has red lipstick on. \n\nThey start to drive away. They pull up at a bank. She walks in and creates a diversion flirting with a bank teller. While another accomplice tells bank teller to put their hands up and give them the money. \n\nThey run away and she gets in the car with the money and they drive away. They hit a series of banks before they hear sirens and enjoying the money.\n\nIn the bridge, they pull them over and get both guys and she tells the cops she will tell them everything. She betrays them in a trial and then after the trial and she got a deal, she still stole some money, counts it and drives while we see her accomplices guilty.",
                "Maroon with moody vibes, and an edgy aesthetic. No CGI and very literal. And there should be a filter that makes everything look dark red - Maroon.\nShe and her love interest are sitting in a room together, she has her feet on his lap and they are listening to a vinyl and laughing, then a dancing scene with no shoes and they are sitting on the roof together looking at the sky and so on. I love that song so much and I would love for her to make videos that lend in heavily into an edgy aesthetic that is more natural if that makes sense. I feel that a lot of her newer videos use a lot of CGI. That\u2019s why I love the Anti-Hero music video so much, it feels so much more natural than the Karma music video for example.",
                "Exile.\n\nStarts with a scene of a door where you can hear screaming voices from behind as the camera sits there for a moment eavesdropping. Camera moves to a view where you can half see the hallway and half see the apartment within. A woman opens the door with a few bags and slams it causing a split screen between the girl in the hallway on left and guy in the apartment on the right. Black screen. Cue music. \n\nShot opens up again as a split screen for the rest of the video to show the pov of both the woman and man as they go through the last day or two of their relationship leading up to the fight showing each of their perspectives on the relationship and how both miscommunicated and failed. They both lay down after the fight and the windows in the distance show the passage of time as they sleep (sped up night\\day night\\day etc etc etc). Wake up and walk outside. The woman greets another man and embraces him as the original man in the other panel walks down the same street and shows him looking at them. The split screen's thin black line disappears as they both now share the space and frame. They make eye contact and a look of understanding and regret passes through both their eyes. Fin.",
                "It\u2019s Nice To Have A Friend  \n  \nIt\u2019s just home video style footage of me and me and my dog from when I got her as a puppy in high school until her passing away shortly after I got married a few years ago.",
                "An 2D animated video of Taylor for Long Live TV that kind of gives Disney 2010 vibes. The video will depict everything in the lyrics.",
                "Right where you left me - following a girl named Este\u2019s love affair and who got left behind cuz the guy she loved (who is married!!) killed her and thus she\u2019s stuck. But you don\u2019t know she\u2019s dead until the very end!",
                "Wonderland and it would be as close to alice in wonderland esque as you can get without violating trademark laws lol\n\nI am clearly very creative and Taylor should hire me pronto",
                "I would just do a goofy music video for Message in a Bottle since the song is fun all good vibes. Just Taylor seeing her crush and then scenarios where he\u2019s doing whatever and she\u2019s around him and fun activities or goofy stuff is happening even if he can\u2019t see her like she\u2019s a ghost but she sees him since that\u2019s her crush.",
                "Timeless: basically the premise of the song- Taylor wearing lots of 1930/1940 outfits with the hairstyles from back then and maybe some scenes of her love (picture a sebastian stan in the first Captain America movie)",
                "Miss Americana and the Heartbreak Prince.\n\nThe genre would be a high school urban fantasy. Miss Americana is top of her class, \u201cchosen one\u201d type character, but the Big Bad is out to get her. The Heartbreak Prince is the troublemaker, and she has a fall from grace that alienates her from her classmates and he\u2019s the only one that believes in her. There would of course be a lot of magic and super powers involved.\n\nTaylor would either be a teacher narrating it, or Miss Americana in the future, which can reveal whether or not the characters end up together. \n\nFor some reason I started associating this song with the Chilling Adventures of Sabrina when I watched it so I can only imagine it being drama at a magic school!",
                "I would definitely pick nbnc! \nAnd here it is, but it might be a little long.. sorry about that!\n\n\nNo Body, No Crime\n\nTaylor is at a police station, being interviewed. She \u2018says\u2019 the lyrics from \u2018Este\u2019s a friend of mine\u2019 to \u2018She says\u2019\nAnd then it cuts to a girl - probably Este - holding a glass of wine sitting in an Olive Garden saying \u2018that ain\u2019t my merlot on his mouth\u2019 to \u2018no there ain\u2019t no doubt, i think i\u2019m gonna call him out\u2019\n\nThen for the \u2018she says\u2019 it goes back to Taylor telling the officer what Este said, with the girl sitting behind Taylor, looking ghost like and stuff.\n\nDuring the \u2018i think he did it but i just can\u2019t prove it\u2019 bit, it\u2019s Taylor watching the officer go on a break, and turning around to look at the girl, who sings/says the \u2018No, no, He did it\u2019\n\nThen the officer returns and its back to Taylor talking to him. \nAt the \u2018Este wasn\u2019t there\u2019 to the \u2018or anywhere\u2019 bit, it\u2019s Taylor sitting at Olive Garden alone, with some dinner and two glasses of red wine looking around.\n\n\u2018He reports his missing wife\u2019 is a man - Este\u2019s husband - talking to the cops and it pans out to his very obviously used truck - with brand new tires\n\nThen its back to Taylor talking to the officer for the \u2018and his mistress moved in\u2019 to the \u2018and everything\u2019 bit.\n\nThen, Taylor turns to look behind her, as the Officer in front of her looks like he\u2019s asleep, and she says \u2018No there ain\u2019t no doubt\u2019 to the \u2018He did it\u2019 bit\n\nThen it\u2019s Taylor leaving the police station holding a boating license, and then it cuts to a scene of her cleaning her house and looking at the license sitting on the table.\n\nIt changes to her rowing a boat into the middle of a river with another girl - Este\u2019s sister - and then the girl disappears as Taylor grabs a suspicious bag from where the girl was sat, and chucks it into the river\n\n^ These 2 are for from the \u2018Good thing my daddy made me get a boating license when I was fifteen\u2019 to the \u2018Good thing his mistress took out a big life insurance policy\u2019\n\nAnd then it cuts to Taylor, the girl we saw on the boat with her, some other people and another girl, whos being arrested by the police. That girl is Este\u2019s husband\u2019s mistress, and during this it slowly pans to Taylor as she sings the lyrics.\n\nand then for the 'she thinks i did it but she just can't prove it' bit Taylor smiles as the girl is taken away by the cops\n\nThe remaining bit of the song is Taylor and Este's sister walking to a car and then driving away to who knows where.\n\nEdit: Este and her sister would be played by two of the band HAIM, maybe the other one could be in the background during the scene where the mistress is arrested, or is the mistress?",
                "Hits Different!\n\nI can picture it a lot more elaborate in my head hah but I can imagine a present-day Taylor getting drunk at a bar, wandering the streets and stumbling into images of past Taylor and her man at all the places they used to go to and follows them around\u2026like peering back in time to their first date spot, trips to the beach, dancing together, the apartment they shared together, etc etc.  And that\u2019s juxtaposed with current Taylor in the present day at those same spots all alone, trying to join in and reach out to \u2018touch\u2019 the past but she just goes right through them.",
                "Better than revenge (og version). We see the girl \u201cstealing\u201d the guy from her, then Taylor sees the girl trying on wedding dresses in a shop and later sneaks into the wedding, where she takes the knife from the cake and kills the man, then kisses the girl. Slightly unhinged, just like the song lol",
                "Right where you left me. The video would be heavily inspired by Miss Havisham from Charles Dickens \u201cGreat Expectations\u201d (In the novel her fianc\u00e9 sent her a note while she was getting ready for the wedding breaking it off. She decided to never remove her wedding dress and had all the clocks stopped at the time she received the note.)",
                "I\u2019ve actually had this idea for SO LONG but TLGAD would be SO cool. \n\nStarts out with a \u201csold\u201d sign being put in and Taylor walking up to Holiday House for the first time. She walks in and starts exploring and taking it all in, then she finds a dusty old diary in a closet. She opens it and the song starts. As she reads, there is a montage of Rebekah\u2019s life as told in the song basically just every lyric is acted out in a scene. As she sings the \u201cthen it was bought by me\u201d line, she closes the diary and we return back to modern day with Taylor in the house. For the last part of the song there is a montage of Taylor living in the house and it plays in the same style as Rebekah\u2019s montage, but this time we get Taylor\u2019s Holiday House 4th of July parties, her bringing home different men (a play on the medias obsession with her dating life), and slowly watch Taylor grow old in the house and it ends with the old Taylor writing in the same diary from the beginning. She leaves it in the same spot she found it originally. Cut to the last scene, another \u201csold\u201d sign goes on the front lawn and a new woman walks up in the same way we saw Taylor walk up. She goes inside to explore her new home and it ends with her opening the closet where the diary is.",
                "Castles Crumbling. It tells the story of a king and queen of an at first flourishing kingdom and follows the king's descent into madness. The twist is that the song is from the king's point of view but the video is from the queen's point of view. She tries to help him, but over time he becomes paranoid and convinces himself that she's against him. He locks her away in a tower. By the end, the commoners have turned against the king and started an uprising. The queen watches helplessly from the tower as her kingdom goes down in flames.",
                "Cowboy Like me has always given me Sabrina vibes so I'd need some sort of super fancy party in a tent, maybe a wedding or the yacht club party from Starlight. Anyway, cue Taylor in a very fancy propper dress and bun just kinda on the outskirts of the party but catching the eyes of someone dashing and mysterious (Tom Hiddleston, Harry- are either of you available?) And the whole video is just this.drawn out    play of them trying to get to each other while being coy and as the song ends they finally walk away arm in arm and we see taylor has on some cute cowboy boots under her gown.",
                "I got two:\n\nThe Lakes: An ethereal take on Alice and Wonderland. A girl finds herself in the Lakes region and encounters gorgeous wisteria laden path that she goes down. Heading towards the literal peaks of Windermere in the distance as we see her wiping tears. As she goes she meets the Lakes poets. Wordsworth- A floating cloud that dissipates to show a sunny lake next to a field of golden daffodils swaying in a breeze. Coleridge- She continues down a path until we hear a rush of water. She perks through a patch of cattails as she sees a stream. She steps through as she laughs delighted as otters play on the bank then jump in and play as they swim and jump about. Southey- She continues down the path, and from behind a tree comes a little boy asking \" How does the water come down at Ladore?\" She turns back towards the entrance of the path as we see water lifting all around and come like a flood rushing back through the scenes and along the path until water fills the frame and fades to white. We see the girl left standing there as wisteria grows over her body and feet. The chorus begins to repeat 3x and on the 4th time pans to a girl sleeping on a blanket in her back yard next to a copy of The Lake Poets: Three of the Titans of English Poetry Muse in One of Englands Finest Landscapes as we see a cell phone ringing from the contact Mother in Law \ud83c\udff9\ud83d\udc3b with the chorus as the ring tone. \n\nGorgeous: Taylor enters a home and shows a delighted yet sneaky expression as she catches someone walk by but we can't see. She begins through the home peeking around corners. Following someone around but ducking quickly behind walls when she thinks they are looking as she says can't say anything to your face, cause look at your face. Her desperate excitement and stealth grows as she goes from room to room until we end with someone coming out of a bathroom and her going oh hey! Do you mind if I pet your cat? Then she snuggles it to the cats fur and hold it up to face her as she ends by saying\"Your Gorgeous\"\n\nEdited to add: I was also going to do Mirrorball originally but tbh that Lakes really took it out of me after taking an hour to write \u270d\ufe0f.

We then flashback, using a filmstrip style to fights and losses. When we cut back to the chorus, we see a pristine body, placed in a coffin, but slight color is seeping in, we see the red of everyone's lips.\n\nFrom the background, we see an ethereal ghost, and it's of the soul that is now being buried. Their cheeks are stained with tears, leaving a scar. As the next chorus comes in the color starts to flourish, and we witness the power of the spirit, correlating to the lyric \"You know I didn't want to, have to haunt you, but what a ghostly scene.\" As the bridge comes in, more color is apparent. Then, we see the spirit/ghost controlling water. It drowns out all of the people who have wronged the ghost, but... It still hurts the people who supported them.\n\nAs we see the bodies, we see the ghost look upon the wounds inflicted by their sadness and waters... And the utter that their 'tears ricochet', showing that their sadness and loss has hurt everyone.\n\nJust a concept, based on something I used in a story of mine! Would love some feedback!",

Using cinematic mode on my phone, a gimbal, a tripod, and capcut on my desktop computer, i\u2019m going to make this entire music video. I\u2019ll probably use final cut pro to color correct but i\u2019m generally gonna use capcut to edit it.

But it's across the street and he gets on the bus and you aren't quite sure it was even him. She stumbles at the change back into the chorus and falls down to be picked up by someone else. They head off to a bar together for a drink and they're hitting it off.\n\nNext is invisible string. \n\nThat someone else from the 1 and her are moving in together to a beautiful cabin in the woods. They're unpacking, hanging up pictures of the past few years. We see a picture of the Lover house. They dance in the refrigerator light. There's a grand piano to replace her keyboard, and there's a Platinum Record to hang on the wall. At the bridge, there's a dinner party for the new home. Joe Jonas, Sophie Turner, and the Lautners are all there. Throw in Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds, taylors family, and whoever else wants to come and be happy. You see a sign that says \"This is our place, we make the rules\"\n\nTaylor's partner comes over, gets on knee, and you see her surprise followed by absolute contentedness as you hear the ending vocalizations.",

                "Enchanted: Remember when she did a deal for a perfume called Wonderfu- sorry Wonderstruck and she did a bunch of commercials. Yeah, that's kind of the Idea of this video. I watched all of the videos of this era and all of them are about a early 20s (and gorgeous) Taylor in work, college or crying in her house in December. But we never saw a fairy tail. I know she was trying to separate a bit from the romantic princess at the time, but the song really fits the thematic.\n\nThis is the story of a prince who met Taylor at her castle and when they say goodbye to each other, the chorus starts and she falls in love in that part. \n\nAfter that she wished he was at her door and starts to search him in the treacherous outside. In the outside she finds clues of where is that handsome man she met, and most of the clues are references to other songs.\n\nAt the bridge she finds him during the sunset and tells him that she was enchanted to meet him. And says him \"Please don't be in love with someone else. Please don't have somebody waiting on you\". In the final chorus they kiss (yeah, happy ending) and Taylor blushes and is smiling and they kiss for a second time. But the prince didn't felt nothing and made her understand that they weren't the one for the other. He lefts and she starts crying (and I cry hard) and then she screams at him \"Please don't be in love with someone else. Please don't have somebody waiting on you\". End of the video.\n\nAlso as an extra mention, Vigilante Shit, I want to watch a violent and bloody Taylor Swift Music Video.

                "MY TIME HAS COME \n\nHEAR ME OUT... FOLKLORE LOVE TRIANGLE CENTERED NARRATIVE\n\nA short film similar to Niki's \"But I'm letting go\"\n\nStarts with Cruel Summer. I'm thinking lots of purple, blues, pink lighting. Rendevous. Fast paced. Twirling cinematography to match the beats. The two characters litterally standing in the light of the vending machine. Its like viewing a summer fling through rose colored glasses. This part would highlight James dismissive nature towards Augustine. At times how he's a bit too cold. passive. Augustine picking up that he's not reciprocating the same intensity of feelings.\n\nsegway to the end of the summer fling: August. I know it'll be a bit of a whiplash but it'll be Augustine probably waking up. The bright colored lighting fades to subdued colors: beiges, dull blues, greys. like the contrast filter is all the way down kinda vibe. She goes to the beach and remembers the less chaotic parts of the summer fling with james: hanging out at the beach, the lingering stares, meeting behind the mall. It's retrospective and reflective, knowing that he isn't truly her's. It ends with her saying goodbye to James as he leaves for home.\n\nTime for betty. The story now focuses on James setting down at home, first day of school. He's pretty lonely, just skate boarding around town. Betty is pretty cold towards James. It would highlight the feeling of James really trying to subtly reach out (stares, smiles, trying to say hi but getting plain IGNORED) but getting shut down everytime.\n\nAlso I'd like to plant an Inez cameo somewhere in Cruel Summer or August. This section would show Inez talking to Betty and James immediately realizes that he screwed up/got caught.\n\nAlso the dance should be portrayed. James seeing Betty dance with someone else from afar and him just dipping.\n\nThen showing how he met Augustine, I'm thinking about maybe something along the lines of: James broke his skateboard in the town he was summering in. Augustine, a childhood friend, accidentally stumbles upon James and gives him a ride home.\n\nNow we get to the meat of it: James's apology. We're going back to the swirling cinematography. It's all in his head. Romanticized. We then cut back to him waiting at Betty's door. At the line \"I miss you\" the door opens. The ending here is ambiguous.\n\nTime skip: Cardigan. An older Betty stumbles upon some of James' belongings (the cardigan perhaps but rlly on the nose). She's in a big city now. She goes out to to take a walk and remember her relationship with james. I still think the colors should be kinda subdued to show reflection (like the August section). The camera work is more of close ups, realistic movement (like shakiness), showcases more of the raw emotion. This is in contrast to the swirling motions, which is used to indicate romanticism, the rose colored glasses, myopia.\n\nThe bridge should show her life without James. How James haunts her a bit. Always lingering in her mind. It feels empty, yet slightly angry.\n\nIt ends with her storing the cardigan away.\n\n(ideally we could fit illicit affairs somewhere here but im not sure where itd go since the story would be unbalanced with more focus on augustine than better if it were to be there)",

E.g. everything turns rose gold and blurry for the \"double vision in a rose blush\" line, she is walking along a line of cafes and shops with the ocean in the background for the lines about the coastal town, she jumps off a platform and lands on another below for the \"falling feels like flying\". She occasionally spins, rolls forward, jumps, etc. She jumps into a big tea cup for the \"fades into the grey... day old tea\" line. She is on a wooden floor and gestures to an Eagles t-shirt hanging on a nearby doorhandle.

At this point they have no choice but to run yet again.\n\nThoughout the video they go through great lengths to ensure they are never caught, similar to how celebrities go to great lengths to avoid being seen with their significant other.\n\nStarting at the bridge of the song (I have such a clear vision in my brain oh my god) Taylor and her man are in the car being chased by the police. There are helicopters and officers blocking the roads and everything. When they finally find a place to hide for a bit (an alleyway for example) they realize that the only way for them to not get caught is for them to split up for good. When they stick together theyre more likely to get recognized.\n\nIts the final scene of the video. The song is over. A helicopter finds them and shines the lights on them, we hear a booming voice telling them to out their hands in the air. Taylor and her partner exchange looks in slow motion. Their eyes are glossy. Taylor's hair is a little messy. Their hairs are intertwined. Then, the final shot of the video. Their hands slowly pull apart but they still reach for each other, alluding to Michaelangelo's famous painting, The Creation of Adam. Cut to black.

Helicopter lights shining on them. Taylor looks at him, eyes glossy. This is it. They have no choice but to let themselves get caught and face the consequences. He looks at her and mouths \"I love you\" before making a run for it. Taylor stares at him in disbelief, reaching for him. The outro ends now so all we hear is the sound of a helicopter and sirens. Taylor stares in the direction he ran although hes long gone, tears rolling down her cheeks but shes still in disbelief. We hear a voice frim the helicopter say \"PUT YOUR HANDS IN THE AIR.\" Taylor looks upward at the heli and does as they say. Police cars pull up and block her from making a run for it, officers getting out and pointing weapons at her. Her stunned expression remains on her face while tears roll down her cheeks and her hair blows in the wind. Then, the video cuts to black.\n\nThe alternate ending symbolizes how after their relationship Taylor got the worst of the backlash and Calvin essentially let it happen which was one of the events leading to her downfall in 2016 (mirroring the music video where its implied she got arrested and her partner walks free.)",

And it slowly transmutes into her envisioning herself and her current love as 40s lover, he\u2019s going off to war and she\u2019s bidding him goodbye. It cycles through her reading letters from him. He comes home from war. Then slowly it goes back to their current day goes through some of their moments together ending when the song references lovers in 1958 - that scene would be her and her love at prom in 2008.\n\nSlowly it transforms back to her in the antique shop shopping. She picks up a book covered in cobwebs. The title is \u2018Fate\u2019 with two lovers on the front. She slowly starts reading and again we\u2019re transferred to a different setting of her and her lover in the 1500s in a foreign land - she\u2019s being forced to marry another man as he watches. He would have written her love letters and she eventually runs away.\n\nIt turns back into her in the antique shop. Then when it says the story started when you said hello\u2026 she begins daydreaming about them meeting. She thinks about their life together, envisions actually growing old together and shows them loving life.\n\nThen at the end when she says \u201cdown the block there\u2019s an antique shop and something in my head said stop so I walked in\u201d it pans back to her at the antique shop, checking out with a bunch of items in a cardboard box and then walking out onto the street.\n\nI envision this every time I listen to it!!!"

            "selftext": "I know, this kind of posts has been made here before, but I\u2019d like some fresh input. \n\nI have been a Spotify Premium user for 6 years, been on a Duo plan for about a year and I\u2019ve been loving my experience, but a few things bug me. I have been using AM for 2 days now and I\u2019m not sure if I should make the switch.\n\nThings that would make me stay on Spotify:\n\n- User Interface and the snappiness of the interface. It is somehow better than AM, even on IOS.\n\n- The Pre-made playlists. Sometimes I am just looking for a certain type of vibes so it\u2019s perfect for that.\n\n- Queue management. It\u2019s way better than AM\n\n- I am using non Apple devices (Windows laptop for work and Chromecast in the living room TV, but planning to buy an Apple TV)\n\n\n\nActually, the main thing that would make me switch to AM is the sound quality with Atmos. When it\u2019s done correctly, it sounds amazing. I even have an Atmos soundbar in the living room so that would be nice. \n\nI had to turn sound check on though because the contrast between Atmos and non Atmos songs was too much.\n\nAlso, the Shuffle mode. I can\u2019t stand the \u201cshuffle\u201d mode on Spotify, it just keeps playing the same songs in the same sequence and they think we don\u2019t notice.\n\nSo I figured I could ask the community what made you switch? Am I forgetting something? I am curious.\n\nIf you were in my shoes, considering my points above, would you do it?\n\nThank you!",

I did immediately notice the higher music quality of AM and now going back is rough. I'm not an audiophile whatsoever and didn't think I'd hear a difference, but I do.\n\nAfter using AM for a bit, it's started to recommend pre-made playlists just like Spotify's that are just as good.  It's also starting to recommend some artists and albums that are on the money.  \n\nI can't speak to AM on Windows, but I can tell you now that AM has nothing even close to Spotify Connect.

Apple mostly uses AM as a way to sell their hardware. Spotify seems designed to try to keep the user actively engaged on the app, while IMO AM is not. They're making design decisions from a different place than Spotify, and the TikTok-style infinite scrolling home screen is the most glaring example of this. AM interface could absolutely be better in several ways, but I can't think of any feature in recent memory where users agreed unanimously that it was of zero benefit to them, and only benefitted the company.\n\nI could go on, but I think you get the drift. As Apple closes the gap on subscriber numbers, I see Spotify making more commerce-only decisions that alienate their customers. Music streaming is a commodity at this point, so the cost to switch (and then switch back, if you want) is practically zero.",

This was my primary reason for switching.\n2. User interface. Spotify used to win in this category, but now the app is a cluttered mess that is actively removing features I like. Spotify used to show you every song you \"liked\" when you clicked on an album. This was helpful if it had been months/years since you had heard an album and just wanted to see your most-liked tracks. This feature was removed several months ago for no reason. AM doesn't do this either, but the AM app is way prettier and organizes my library much better. Overall, AM is better in every category other than the queue, which Spotify does better.\n3. Music Discovery. Yes, really. Everyone always says that Spotify is king in this category, but I disagree. Apple's curated playlists and radio stations offer more variety imo. Whereas Spotify would often recommend the same songs/artists. Apple Music still doesn't have anything as good as Spotify's Discover Weekly, but AM's Discovery Radio is very close.",

                "Spotify is too clunky and very distracting. Apple Music is simple, no promoted playlists, no ads, no weird redesign choices and of course, the ecosystem and the lossless audio. I even have the student discount, which in my country, is cheaper than Spotify\u2019s.",
                "I switched from Spotify to Apple Music a while back, and while having a few issues at the beginning, I never looked back:  \n\\- The good thing about Spotify's excellent algorithm is that you always get new music you will mostly like but don\u00b4t know. The downside is that you will always only get the music you already like. It\u00b4s harder to \"develop\" your music taste because the algorithm only recommends the music genres you already listen to. For example, you always listen to American rap, but you don\u2018t know that you would like Jazz Music. But Spotify won\u2018t recommend Jazz because the algorithm thinks you don\u2019t like it - because you never listened to it. That\u2018s the kicker.  \nI once tested the Apple Music Algorithm by creating a new Apple ID and starting on Apple Music with a free trial. I let my phone listen to only rap music playlists on repeat, nothing else, only American rap music, for like a week. Time after time, listening to my personal radio station, I got Pop songs, sometimes Electronic or very old-school music. People mistake it for a flaw in the algorithm, but I think Apple does this on purpose. It feels more \u201chuman\u201d to change the whole Genre from time to time. Spotify doesn\u2019t do that for whatever reason. If you listen to Rap music a lot, Spotify thinks you should listen only to Rap music for the rest of your life.  \n\\- If you use Apple Music, tell Siri, \"Hey Siri, play new music I like\". This was GROUNDBREAKING for me when I tried it out the first time. With this Siri command, Apple Music creates an entirely new personal Radio Station that plays like 70% new music based on the theme you usually listen to and about 30% of the music you listen to often. This can not be found in the App itself, and it\u2019s like a secret that doesn\u2019t get advertised by Apple. You have to go out of your way with this Siri command to get this. It is so so good. When I drive to work, I usually only play this exceptional Radio station.  \n\\- Spotify is way more social, but you have to care about those social features to consider them essential. I don\u00b4t care at all what other people listen to, and I always found that Spotify Wrapped Up is nice, but only for me personally in terms of statistics. It gets so cringe when people start posting their wrapped-ups on Instagram, and Twitter-like anyone cares, but maybe that\u2019s just me.  \n\\- I learned that Spotify is perfect for the casual, young modern listener who\u00b4s always looking for a new hit that\u00b4s no longer than 2:53 minutes. While Apple Music is more for a puristic listener that listens to many older songs, mostly music he already knows. Someone who doesn\u2019t feel the need to discover new music every day. Suppose you\u2019re more like that kind of a listener than Apple Music is for you. It\u00b4s better for people who already know their music taste well and look for new music.  \n\\- Apple Music has come a long way, and its algorithm got optimised massively during the last couple of months. The algorithm was the main weak point of Apple Music and maybe still is, but it got a lot better.  \n\\- Apple Music is significantly louder and better quality-wise if you\u00b4re using AirPods 2, AirPods Pro, AirPods Max or Powerbeats Pro. The difference is amazing. That\u00b4s due to Apple's special build-in H1-Chip in Apple's ear- and headphones that only support Apple Music. I tested this over many hours with Spotify's sound options maxed out and normalised Spotify sound. Spotify doesn\u2019t come close to Apple Music in that aspect.  \n\\- You can sort your library perfectly, while Spotify doesn\u00b4t even have \"a real library\" where you can edit data of your songs, albums etc. Apple Music is cut off from any podcasts, which I like a lot. Podcasts and Music are two different things for me. On Apple Music, I can change Album covers that I don\u2018t like.  \n\\- On Apple Music, I can upload older music from CDs that are nowhere available to stream, and it gets immediately uploaded to the cloud and adds seamlessly to my music library. The experience feels more \u201cPro\u201c with Apple Music. It gives you more options than Spotify.  \n\\- I can not confirm at all that Apple Music is buggy. It works perfectly fine on all devices (iPhone, iMac Pro, iPad Pro, Apple Watch 5). This might have been the case in the beginning phase of AM 2015-2017, but now I\u00b4m not having any issues at all.  \n\\- Apple Music pays artists almost double the amount of Spotify.  \n\\- Apple Music has its own radio stations and radio shows in many countries over the world. There are no algorithms creating playlists, but real people giving their opinions and curating music for you. The difference between what a real person curates and what an algorithm curate is still unreal.  \n\\- For me, the interface of Apple Music is levels above what Spotify does design-wise. It perfectly fits iOS and Apple\u2019s design in general and looks so good and clean. I can change the volume right on the player's interface, which on Spotify I can not do.  \n\\- Many global also Chinese corporations like Tencent hold shares and are involved in Spotify. With Spotify, you don\u00b4t have any data privacy at all; they track everything about your listening experience and then sell your data to anyone willing to pay for it. Same as Google does. Apple also tracks you, but they keep the data for themselves and don\u00b4t sell it to third parties.  \nIf you want to know how I enjoy music: I use Apple Music as my \"daily driver\" and keep my music library there. I also have a Spotify account which I can keep for free (with ads). I use Songshift to sync my playlists from Apple Music to Spotify. Sometimes, I let my Phone play my Apple Music playlists on Spotify at a deficient volume at night. The following day I opened the Spotify App. I get outstanding excellent new music. Which I then sync over to Apple Music. Like this, you can have the best of both worlds, lol.",
                "I used Spotify since 2010 and switched this month. Reason? Price. I have two tb iCloud, and Apple One is almost the same price as paying a Spotify family plan and two tb iCloud. \n\nI found the audio quality is better, and I have actually started discovering more new music than before. To keep a link with my Spotify, I bought playlisty and it works well. I scrobble to lastfm with quietscrob, and honestly, I don\u2019t miss Spotify too much. I just wish we had something similar to Spotify Connect, but AM works\u2014 I can listen to music with it. Also the user interface, although slow, it\u2019s cleaner.",
                "I switched in January 2022 during that whole Joe Rogan controversy where a few artists decided to pull their music from Spotify. None of it was music I listened to myself, but I had been considering trying Apple Music for a while (especially with their generous 3 month trial + Apple TV+ bundled with the student plan) and I figured this would be a good time to try it.\n\nThe main things that I wanted to try were:\n\n- Being able to upload your own music and deal with it FAR more easily than Spotify. It just treats your local music as any other Apple Music track.\n- The live radio stations. I mainly listened to Hits and then basically stopped listening entirely after finding WFMU, but I still think it's a really cool feature to have. Really shows Apple's focus on human curation.\n- Lossless / Apple Digital Master music. Some albums really do sound better on AM (Songs in the Key of Life is a major one), even if you don't play in lossless, and that's thanks to the ADMs.\n- No podcasts. Prefer keeping a separate app for that.\n\nAfter switching, I found these aspects were pretty good too:\n\n- The Apple Music curated playlists. I'm not much of a playlist person and the user playlists are pretty piss-poor/hard to find compared to Spotify, but Apple's own are pretty good. Great cover art for them too.\n- Animated covers I like much more than Spotify's alternative.\n- The lyrics feature operates much better than Spotify's.\n- iTunes sucks but I do really like being able to manipulate metadata for Apple Music tracks as if they were my own files. I got a Mac recently and Music.app certainly feels a lot better, even if it really is just a reskinned iTunes.\n\nAnother major thing I noticed is that with Spotify I got into a major rut and just started playing my liked songs over and over instead of trying anything new. And then it'd turn out I hate some of those liked songs and unlike them, meaning the songs I'd play over and over would get smaller and smaller. I intentionally chose not to port my liked songs playlist or even my list of albums over, instead just starting up a library from scratch, and I dig it. Back to being more of an album listener.",

On Spotify I found myself playing the shit out of one song until I hated it because it was an immediate bop but not a lot of substance.\n\nPeople complained a lot about AM\u2019s recommendations but I think it\u2019s because Spotify users that made a temporary switch to AM and back weren\u2019t satisfied with the fact that it actually recommends music that you don\u2019t constantly see on social media reels.

This is not a major life decision, especially since you can just drop Spotify down to the free tier without losing any of your music and go back to Premium anytime you want. It's harmless to use Apple Music for a few months to see if you like it. The trial period is not long enough to make that decision.\n\nYou can use the Playlisty or SongShift apps to copy all your songs and playlists from Spotify to Apple.

Personally, I found the \u201csimple\u201d AM UI more frustrating, and found that Deezer\u2019s UI was exactly what I was trying to get away from in the new Spotify UI.     \n\nAM\u2019s lossless audio and mini-player were by far the two things I was most impressed with, but the lack of ease of use in things like navigating the UI was what put me off.     \nActions like: Making/managing playlists was more difficult, jogging/saving/replaying/earmarking songs from AM\u2019s radio queues was iffy and frustrating, and clicking through Apple playlists to get artist/album info was not the one-click experience I thought it would be. Plus, the AM app kept resetting its play volume to a blaring 100% every time I returned to it.",

What I miss though is being able to turn off music at my desk with my phone, seamlessly switching between what device I'm listening on without having to go to that device and turning it off...\n\nHonestly that might be switch back to Spotify in November.

                "i switch to Apple Music because:\n\n1. Instead of \"Love\", it has \"Add to Library\" which it makes more sense to collect your favorites. i can even add individual songs into its specific album unlike spotify which if you \"love\" it, it will add into \"Liked songs\" playlist, you need to love the entire album to collect the entire songs of an album into your library.\n2. Lossless songs, since 24Bit/48Khz is already good to me, it's nice that my laptop has 24bit/48khz sound support and Apple Music app (still in preview) is now on Windows.\n3. i love the UI especially Lyrics because it has smooth animations and the Sing (word by word) karaoke lyrics is pleasing to my eyes, i love the Backdrop gradient color in the background based on album art's color in Now Playing screen. the best part that all of these UI is also available on Android, and the Windows app (the backdrop gradient album art color when in Mini player with Lyrics).\n4. Dolby Atmos and Dolby Audio (5.1 & 7.1 surround) because some songs mixed on that format is so good but also some songs is not very okay like they remove some bass or background vocals.\n5. i don't need Podcasts or Audiobooks mixed into one app, I'm glad Apple having their own Podcast and Books app for those type of content for years. \n6. Album Artwork is in High resolution except on Android and Windows. It's so good looking on iPhone and iPad but on Android and Windows, idk why they lowered their Resolutions on those platforms.\n7. Animated artwork. yes, some animated album artwork especially the full screen versions is pleasing to my eyes, it's something like Spotify Canvas but atleast, the album art is actually animated by label/artists itself, not canvas having random videos and anything. it's also available on Android and Windows (in Windows, animated artwork is in Album page when in Search, Listen Now, and Browse section)",

For me it's not worth it for  just Atmos that has to be mixed properly. \n\nSpotify Connect is also another plus point that for some weird reason AM can't have meanwhile every other app has some type of contiunity - which mean even if you would be full Apple you wouldnt have that seamless transition from device to device. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot sure whit the shuffle.

                "To be honest, I never swapped to Apple Music intentionally. I had arranged a meeting with the Genius Bar back at the start of the year as my 1st Gen AirPods Pro were playing up, due to crackle/feedback when I coughed, moved or breathed too hard. I'd had them replaced two or three times before (both inside and outside of warranty, but at zero cost) very kindly by Apple as I understand it was a known problem with early batches.\n\nOn the last replacement pair I got in February, they gave me six months Apple Music free - so I dabbled with it and quite liked the UI and some of the functions, and eventually found myself using it more than Spotify as the sound quality was substantially better - even through my home speakers.\n\nAbout a month ago, my replacement AirPods broke again - same issue, failed speaker which crackles in ANC or Transparency mode - and I went back to the Apple Store. Unfortunately, they said they couldn't change them any longer as they were no longer supported. I was a little annoyed, as it was six months since they'd replaced them AGAIN but they'd advised that they only offer a 90-day extended warranty on replacement parts now which was disappointing, but to be honest, I'd gotten four years out of them and despite countless issues, Apple had always rectified the problem.\n\nI opted to purchase the 2nd Gen ones new from Apple and got a further six months Apple Music free to use, and quite frankly, much prefer it over Spotify now. The social features are a little lacking as my friends mostly use Spotify still, but to be honest - I'm there to listen to music, not see what my friends are listening to.\n\nTL;DR - I got 12 months free across two sets of AirPods Pro and haven't looked back."

                "Without question in my mind, the Russian's best tactical warfare in this war has been fighting retreats. They are really good at running away.\n\n**Battle of Kyiv**: After the Russian army's most elite units were smashed and lost at the Battle of Kyiv, they fought a fighting retreat that saved lives and equipment. Success here was mostly due to Ukraine being nearly completely unprepared for the war in Kyiv.\n\n**Battle of Kharkiv II**: Another bigger example is after their loss at the Battle of Kharkiv II/Battle of Izium II. Mind you, that was also after losing the Battle of Kharkiv I where they could not enter a city located only a few dozen kilometers from their own border. Battle of Kharkiv II they managed to retreat the 30-40km without a huge loss of life (although their were roads which Ukraine managed to hit) - but here they still managed to lose huge amounts of equipment.\n\nMixed results there, to put it mildly.\n\n**Battle of Kherson I**. Over a period of weeks after losing the Battle of Kherson I, they managed to preserve much of their equipment and get it across the Dnipro.\n\nSimilar but smaller examples are the Russian losses at the **Battle of Chernehiev**, and the Russian loss at the **Battle of Sumy.**\n\n[Urozhaine is different](https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2023/8/12/2186469/-Ukraine-Update-Russian-folly-at-Urozhaine-and-Ukraine-s-long-game-across-the-Dnipro) in some respects, because if has been surrounded by Ukraine on 3 sides as - classic Russian tactics - [counter attacked in the open](https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2023/7/29/2184013/-Ukraine-Update-Russia-doing-its-counterattack-out-in-the-open-thing-all-over-again) and of course continued their own slaughter at the hands of Ukraine.\n\nBut I think now here we are seeing something different. Ukraine is successfully and timely hitting broken Russian formations doing they thing they are best at - running away from the fight.\n\nNice to see that timely and accurate fire missions on retreating troops, really important to hit them in the open when you have a chance. And here we see exactly that, including possible flexing of added capabilities like using cluser munitions to gain a broader area of effect. \n\nEven if not exactly precise, still a menacing omen of things to come as Ukraine has clearly sharpened its military between Kyiv and the Kherson offensive. Russia is lucky Ukraine didn't have this army back then, or that 40 km convoy would have been completely smashed.\n\nNow, it appears that luck has run out. Good luck with the last thing in this war you were good at, Russia: running away.",

                "I am a newer Apple Music user, having switched from Youtube Music in May, so I have less history with the algorithm, but I am impressed by both of these stations so far!\n\nMy initial impressions of the improved personal station is that it is playing a good variety of songs I already like, songs by artists I like that I don't listen to as much, with about 10-15% of the tracks being brand new to me. Seems like a bit more variety than before.\n\nDiscovery I am still \"discovering\" but so far so good. The very first time I played it, I actually got a bunch of songs I already knew, but after playing a few other songs this morning and coming back to Discovery, it is giving me all new-to-me tracks that I am digging! It has also played a few songs that I used to like on YTM but haven't yet listened to since switching to AM, which is a pretty good sign it is getting to know my tastes!\n\nOf note, as a recent convert from YTM, I can tell you both these stations are better and have way more variety than their equivalent stations on YTM. I am sooo glad I switched for sooo many reasons.",

Recommending a circle of crap like Ed Sheran, One Direction etc, despite disliking all this stuff, it just keeping cycling back to the same rubbish pop and rap which I never listen to. \nThe algorithm for personal radio station seems great so far though.",
                "I think both stations are great and have been providing a lot of good recommendations but it seems it doesn\u2019t like to jump genres too much. It\u2019s sticking to one genre too much when I listen to EVERYTHING!",

It always played really old songs that I haven\u2019t listened to in years or just never really felt like it knew my current personalized tastes. \n\nToday I listened to it for hours with very few skips, and it had a genuinely surprising mix of fav songs and new stuff in the same styles I\u2019ve been into lately. Really loving it, if it actually is an updated algorithm. \n\nFeels like a miss to release such a nice update with little fanfare though. But hopefully it\u2019s just a taste of more Apple Music improvements to come soon.",

The new discovery station is good, but I still prefer this method to the binary that you end up with from two separate stations \u2014 way too much repetition of artists and songs I love OR all totally unknown songs with an occasionally familiar artist mixed in. I regularly want to adjust the mix of loved and unknown songs depending on the day / mood / situation."

I'm of the mind that they should either have someone there(with or without a face, don't gotta show it) or have one of the Shipgirls be skk. I like to have someone to cheer on and say \"That's my boy/grill!\" when they rise up or do something cool instead of trying to self-insert like the game wants me to, because it's hard to envision myself in these situations. Kinda like Nikke with its protag, he's somewhat of a self-insert, but at least we know he's there and isn't formless. Heck, make the skk customizable like in GFL, that'd be cool. Like, even just a pair of hands like they do sometimes would work.",

                "Whats with people in Ghost of Tsushima? \n\nI feel like I'm in an alternate universe or something, it's a perfectly fine game, the definition of a 5/10. Maybe it's b/c I just don't play a ton of video games, but I found the story and characters to be just fine, not totally engaging but not annoying or anything. I feel like the Sly Cooper games by SuckerPunch had more developed characters and themes. I just cannot handle quest after quest of slowly following someone while they monolog at me about how sad they are, I get it, you're sad, can I hit stuff with my sword now. The story is serviceable, but nothing I haven't seen in a hundred samurai revenge films previously, it's like yall haven't seen Lone Wolf and Cub before? \n\nThe open world is fine I guess? I've yet to play a game that does open world as well as Red Dead 2 where u can engage with the setting on more levels then just 'Kill bad guys' or 'repeat the same 4 time wasting bullshit collection things' over and over. Even something like Shadow of War (which is basically everything I hate about Open World games) keeps things interesting with the nemesis system. \n\nAnd the game play, possibly the best part of the game. I appreciate that it's a little more involved then an Arkham Asylum, or a Red Dead, or a Horizon Zero Dawn, but it's not amazing. Dark Souls is real time, edge of your seat stuff, the sword fighting in this is just flashy, and then I'm bored, at a certain point, even on the hardest difficulty i knew i was never gonna lose. The one on one mini bosses are great though, wish there were more. \n\nIf someone can explain what exactly I missed with this one? I find it odd that this became the rallying point for anti TLoU2 discourse, it's a fine game, but nothing to salivate over (unless were talking about Jin's butt, then I get it).",

Not only is comedy one of the main appeals of Sam's channel, but even using wojaks takes away the visual humor present in Sam's videos. Sam likes to randomly insert  disgustingly detailed drawings into his videos which catch you off guard as everything else is crudely drawn or a stick figure. When everything is the same, there's no visual humor.\n\nTL;DR despite ripping him off, this guy doesn't understand why people like Sam's videos",

Now I haven\u2019t seen anything from them, but all this hate because something is similar is just dumb. If you watch it and don\u2019t like it fine, if you like it fine. Who cares. I don\u2019t hate Paladins because it\u2019s like Overwatch, I hate Paladins cause I don\u2019t like the gameplay. \n\nAnyway there\u2019s my rant to release emotion for today cause I\u2019m too self conscious to vent anything that\u2019s meaningful.",

In any case brought it to be known by many other people.\n\nLet the dude do whatever he needs/want.

Not saying to not pursue your passion either btw. For me I am currently pursuing work in game audio, not the same as being a hit maker but it is achievable. I continue to do my creative music on the side and try to keep a business mindset in decisions, when you get good at production and you still feel like nothing has transpired from it, take a step back and view yourself objectively. \u201cDo I know what makes my music, MINE?\u201d / \u201cWhen I watch production guides on youtube from talented channels do I understand the majority of what they are explaining or am I at a point of just picking up some tips/tricks?\u201d /\u201cDo i even release any music?\u201d / \u201cWhat is my brand? My alias, logo, general color palette and mood?\u201d / \u201cwhat kind of audience would I like to reach and how do I reach them?\u201d\n\nSome, none or all of these might apply to you, some of these questions you might not have an answer to for years. I started my hobby in music production when I was about 12, I am 29 now and a Dad lol, I have made a few hundred $ from some indie game soundtrack work. Never released any music on streaming platforms, finally decided my alias and overall branding 2 years ago, currently in a stage of trying to figure out the audience and a general business plan for beginning that path from square one, no WIPs, no unmixed previews, no social media posts that are personal and non-related to alias, and when I am ready for a first release it will be fully planned out for streaming release and curated for a specific demographic. Rough plan is releasing music in another region from where I live.\n\n\nSorry for the word vomit, I normally back out of typing stuff like this because I think no one cares but music I care a lot about and I think back to all the words of wisdom I picked up from internet strangers over the years so if this helps even one person get a new perspective then it wasn\u2019t a waste of time.",

It\u2019s overwhelming because there is no quick path to greatness with this, because every track is different and there are so many other variables, tools, tricks and techniques that seem like its going to take so long to get where I wanna be with it.\n\nWith that said, I like to think I am not total ass at making music. But even if so, the flip side is at least I\u2019m learning a dope ass hobby because of it!\n\nIt can feel discouraging sometimes for me, but I\u2019m sticking to it.

                "I'm not sure. \nI've been making music since 2005, officialy started releasing music in 2007, then in 2009 I came up with an artist name which I have to this day and it represents who I am, I also have a branded logo asociated with my name. It's been 18 years since and I'm still making music. In these 18years I've recorded, composed, songwrite, mix and mastered and produced music for a lot of people and everyone sais that I am very good at what I do. I'm living from music for many years now and I've worked in many studios with a lot of other musicians from all levels, but I love most is working with major artist even though that's not on a daily basis. I often feel like I am not good enough or that I can't do certain tasks even though I always do them and complete them. Am I having imposter syndrome or something like that? Everytime I get myself into major projects I start doubting myself. I'm not playing instruments but I have my ways of replicating instruments because I have studied them. \n\nI feel it's like a rollercoaster of me doubting myself a lot up until I say fuck it and I do whatever I believe it sounds and feel lke right and in 90% of the cases I never miss, or even if I miss I do quickly a different version that still bangs and gets picked by the artist. It's just my mind being in a constant pressure and stress. Maybe sometimes I forget how much I've done and how many years have passed and I'm still doing it. I've been up and down so many times I don't even get sad when things aren't working out because I know that they'll eventualy work out and they always do. Yes, I'm not my best right now projects-wise because last year I lost my favourite person in the whole world, then my best friend. I needed time to pull myself together and now I'm back on the market with some projects on my hand and great opportunities ahead. But everytime I get great opportunities I start doubting myself without realising that if I weren't that good I couldn't get so many good opportunities. I have a lot of other producers/engineers asking me for advices. I have depression since I was 6 years old because of family problems, also ADHD which sometimes drives me crazy.\n\nAlso it took a decade to get some support from my childhood friends who were laughing at me because I was spending time making music, but they were also requesting me to make certain songs for them to enjoy and I was doing it back then, but no real support from friends. Only 1 friend supported me always and he still is to this day (I'm talking about my personal friends, not musician friends). Also, my dad never supported me and he always telling me to go get a job or something because I will startve and I don't even have training or ear for music, little did he know that I was already understanding music since I was like 4 and I was amazed by the sounds from the music that my dad was listening and showing me, without realising he was the one that introduced me into this world. Years have passed and my dad started supporting my music career after 10years of me doing it because he started seeing how many money I was bringing home and the places and people I was seeing and working with. It's all good now, I'm at my lowest right now but I'm going back up again soon.\n\nDoes someone have any advice or struggling with the same issues as me? I know what my problems are, but I feel like I need someone from outside to talk to about this. Thank you!",

The amount of misinformation and buzz words is incredible. I wish that was different, and y'all could go to studios with professionals to see and HEAR how it's done. Home studios are great for someone like me as I can create music and do mixes/mastering from a spare room. They're also great to be able to learn the craft but without any guidance, everyone is worrying about the math, the  magic LUFS level, what vocal chain an artist uses, what your waveform looks like....\n\nThe truth if you can sit in a room with me and I could download all my experience into your head,  I can never let you hear the way it sounds in my head or how it makes me feel. No YouTube video can do that either.\n\nVocal chains- that is what I used on that artist, on that song, on that day, in that studio, with the gear that was available in that studio, on that particular console. There simply is no magic formula other than experience.  If you're consistently turning out tracks you hate, then there is a possibility you should look into other areas in the industry. Im not saying give up by any means, but you shouldn't hate everything you write. \n\nYou're listening to a finished production and comparing it to your own without realizing the evolution that went into the track you're referencing. \n\nChoices - part of production is realizing why a part sounds better on a Rhodes than a piano or as a horn part vs a string part. Telling an artist to do another take because while this one was good, I think you can do a better one. That information can't be gained from  YouTube, school or books unfortunately. \n\nMaking music at all is a way to express your emotions. You want to eventually pass those emotions onto the listener. If you're making any type of music, please realize that is a gift not very many people have no matter what you think about it. That alone should help you from being discouraged. If you're in this game for the money then lemme tell you the industry is not an easy life. \n\nKeep making music that makes you feel. Like minded people will be the ones that appreciate it and there will be others that really don't like it so stay true to yourself. I make music because it's my release. If you're banging out \"10 beats a day\" then I don't understand that from my perspective.\n\nBest of luck to everyone",

Then came the rerelease which added the new songs, and I was again blown away by the progression and how good the songs were. This new one, just didn't quite grab me like the last 10 singles have. It's definitely far and above most stuff that is comparable out there, but I think I just wanted or expected a full new record to compare more toward the bonus tracks on the rerelease. They were written and recorded after the album was done so they were essentially new songs and I absolutely loved them all.

If fit for a king releases a more standard stripped back version of metalcore album it\u2019s called generic but then if a band like ERRA that has tons of riffs and unexpected moments it\u2019s also generic?\n\nI\u2019m starting to wonder what generic even means at this point. Double bass? Breakdowns? Screaming? Singing chorus? That\u2019s the genre. Do you want ukulele in it to change things up? Nah cause you\u2019ll complain that they changed \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nMy best guess is I think maybe everyone having the same exact mix is what contributes to it. I swear it\u2019s the same drum samples, guitar and bass amp sims and vocal processing. Bands really do blend together now cause of it.\n\nEdit: That wasn\u2019t shade thrown towards fit for a king btw I love them.

Gave me a solid HLB vibe with the tone and pitch shift. \n\nThe chorus is different than they normally do for singles, and I'm digging it. \n\nIt's also super refreshing to hear Jesse singing in a register he can hit live, and then in a lower one for the pre-breakdown.\n\nJT just kills it. Always.",

                "Great song, the breakdown is sick in this one. \n\nbut as some others have mentioned the song overall doesn't hit as hard as some of the other songs they have released. JT and Jesse when singing together just hits different, always want more of that.\n\nIt sounds very ERRA, and that's not a bad thing. 8/10",

I\u2019d say no. That\u2019s a tough single to top. Idk if this is a single to preface an album or more of a single to preface their upcoming tour. My gut says this is for the tour and that an album announcement will follow the tour. That being said, I think there\u2019s some realllly good stuff being saved for the album.",

It is both epic and grandiose, but with haunting undertones. Like Farum Azula and Placidusax himself. They are easily one of the most epic elements in the game, but they are falling apart.

When you are tired of running uphill the mountaintops, and then you have to run to break some big boy\u2019s ankles, you dont realize the soundtrack, annoyed and focused as you are trying to not get smacked by the Fire Giant. But imo, that OST perfectly embraces the feel of an epic fight, at the end of the world, of two unstoppable forces fighting for their lives about the course of destiny.\n\nMy top is:\nFire Giant\nFortissax\nGodfrey\nThe Godskins",

So I kept feeling exactly like this when I tried to listen to them until I realized, okay, they have a few songs that *kind of* do what I wanted from them, and then the rest of their music does one of several very different things, but some of those things are also cool in their own way.",

                "I think it's a combination of a couple things mainly involving social media.\n\n1. A&R is dead. Music companies don't develop artists anymore. They just comb social media or soundcloud for the next hot thing, sign them, then throw them out to the public before the artist is ready.\n2. Social media is helluva distraction and causes people to have shorter attention spans. 20-30 years ago a young artists would grind in their local or college scene for years building a core fan base, before getting a deal and being put on by a record company. The years of grinding would sharpen their skills and resolve to make it, so when they finally got a chance to shine on a large platform, they were ready. Now you can blow up overnight using the internet and be forgotten about in the same time.",
                "It\u2019s harder for musicians to become superstars these days. Used to be, we all turned on the radio and were exposed to more or less the same artists. To make an album, you had to get to a studio, record, edit and release an album. You needed distribution and exposure.\n\nYou ever tracked a recording on lead fucking tape? That shit was HARD. It took skill beyond just writing a song and singing. You needed a team of professionals. Consequently there was just less music cut.\n\nThe entire process has changed. People are exposed to music where the fuck ever. Musicians record it where the fuck ever. They release it online, where the fuck ever. To boot, each main genre now has 100+ sub-genres that have their own dedicated fan base.\n\nSounds like I\u2019m complaining. But I\u2019m actually not. In some ways the industry is better. In some ways it\u2019s worse. Net net things are just different now. Good artists are out there they\u2019re just tougher to find. There\u2019s too much to shift through. These folks you listed, they\u2019re all established. Established artists have had more exposure for longer. Younger folks will come up, just takes longer to build a fan base now.\n\nIf it\u2019s anyone\u2019s fault, it\u2019s OUR fault. Attention spans are shorter and people don\u2019t listen to albums anymore. They want that one banger to put on a playlist then they move on.",

Apart from that people have longer life expectancies.\n\nYoung rappers can\u2018t rely on father time anymore to help them pushing the old guard out, they actually have to be better and do it themselves.

Even when media cycles were slower, you probably weren't going to get to the top of your creative industry with just a good starring role or debut album. So while I don't entirely disagree with your point, I do think you're being a bit selective with your examples to illustrate it.\n\nThe digital age has allowed for so many people to reach for their dreams, but the sheer amount of media makes it difficult for someone's entire body of work to stick out. Music execs used to filter out those who were talented but not unique enough to market, whereas now that job has fallen onto our algorithms. \n\nThe closest thing that we have to a blueprint to modern superstardom is probably Lil Nas X, and even then it may be debatable whether or not that label will be applied to him for years to come.",

Covid f the music/rap industry as well. Instead of an year between the albums some rappers had to wait even 3 years and lost all the momentum/fans.\n\n\n3. There arent small labels anymore and the ones that are dont have the power to promote as well as the big ones.\n\n\nMost of the big rappers that gets their break are snatched by the big labels and they dont care about building them up. They just want an hit song from them thats gonna pop on tik tok. They dont care about albums anymore from front to back.\n\nTime passes and they cant get their hands on an hit anymore? They are sidelined and not promoted anymore. The labels move on and sign the newest rapper thats popping and so on.\n\nAnd since these big labels are more pop, rappers also cant act like they used to in the 90s and 00s.

Now , like every single upcoming pop kid is under the age of 20 lol or right around there.   Can't say oh durk is old now , he's been making music since 2009 man lmao.  Rewind 14 years ago and 30 yr old durk is 16 lol. Shit takes time, but even still, the argument is pretty off lol. Every old rock band is 40 to 60 year old dudes now, who were once young when our parents were young.  I think if anything talent is getting younger. Can't put Beyonce in a list saying oh shes 40 now, when she was most popular like 10 20 years ago. She started music when she was 9 my dude lol ... If that ain't young for music, idk what is."

Pretty much everything they\u2019ve done is accessible online in one way or another. They really touch on all genres, but it\u2019s the long improvisational jams I think you might like, they can get very prog rock. They\u2019ll just take a song and get lost in chaos for 20 minutes and somehow bring it back to something familiar. They\u2019re also heavily influenced by and often cover a lot of the bands you already like.

Another great artist is Santana too like Caravanserai and the John Coltrane tribute A Love Supreme with John McLachlan, they are more jazz fusion pieces. Mahivishnu Orchestra Inner Mounting Flame is also fantastic listen from front to back. Bitches Brew by Miles Davis is one I\u2019ll always recommend to jazz fusion lovers. It\u2019s a very loose sounding jazz album, unorthodox and unpredictable in the best way possible. John McLachlan also did the guitar work on the album too. It\u2019s definitely a harsh listen and a long winded one of you not into it, but it\u2019s one I\u2019ll always recommend just cause how important it is to jazz fusion.",

                "Something you need to understand is it is something you want to. But if you do it and you dont like the outcome of it but keep doing it then your just being foolish. Its just like if you like a very dangerous drug but doing it negatively effects your life. Now after saying that, which is something you should always think about, before you do anything, even stand up and walk to the next room, you should take atleast a moment and contemplate that decision in your brain. But flipping sides, I know exactly how you feel with music wanting to control your life. I have been making music both personally and professionally since 1999 and I spent way too much time doing it especially to not getting results that I would like, being making a successful living doing it (tough running your own business for me atleast) and/or being able to tour the world performing my own music to people that appreciates it or even just finds entertainment in listening, i dont even care about getting paid, just pay for my trip, lol. Im not sure it was every negative in my relationships. I first started guitar when i was 12 and from that as well as rapping, singing, making coomplete music projects I think those things were a big reason why I ended up getting in relationships and making more friends especially playing a guitar for a female. I have just tried to schedule my time right and focus on the fastest ways to accomplish taking sounds out of my head and putting it in audio. From reading how much you seem to have negative outcomes from your music maybe you can do something else in music, like focusing on learning 1 instrument and practicing making life music with other people. I have done alot of playing guitar with drummers, piano players or really anything, harmonic, accordion. Ive actually kinda forced random friends into music a little by supplying them with and instrument and teaching a little to get them started. You know, i dont know, i probably have a lot more i could say on all these topics but i tend to ramble and I was just trying to find something to say to you that could help you in the future so if you would like to have a deeper conversation anytime about these topics im always available so you can message, i would enjoy it just to talk to someone and especially about music. But if your in a relationship you need to focus on your relationship if its at all important to you and sometimes maybe consider like punishing yourself. LIke you can say to yourself since you are not finding a way to accomplish things in music faster than you are now, like . man its hard for me to word this..... like i force myself to not make music even if im right at the end of a project or i feel like i NEED TO NOW!!! i have that side of me thats willing to hurt myself in hopes that it can help change me. I force myself to do say.. spend time with a friend and try to force all thoughts of music out of my head and try to just talk to my friend abiout their life or what do they want to do. I hate a biy of it cause im already thinking about music but i just try to make myself remember that for the next times im trying to make music and alot of the time becomes too much procrastination or spending hours or days on making one sound/instrument exactly what i hear in my head and just playing with settings and not accomplishing anything. When i know for a fact that i could make great music super fast if i just put my focus on it or work my whole life and workflow with making music better like making better templates so when i am around the house and have a song idea i can jump into one of my daws and quickly have all the basic instruments for making that song and using later time to go back to all these quick songs i make and repick instruments or edit adanced things like automating and moving stuff around and cuts and stuff. The tedious stuff. compartmentalize all of the tasks that you do to accompolish making music. Plan days where you just spend all your time tweaking sounds and maybe making instruments, not songs, but making things that you will use later when you are mkaing music. Even if its just going through some vsti presets and organizing things so you can access whatever you want faster. Then maybe you can pick a day to work on vocals and days for mixing songs and this can get big i can go further but im sure i dont have but maybe 1 person still reading this. or maybe not, i might already be talking to myself ;-) Anyway, i wish you good luck on growing and doing better for yourself! Hope I helped some.",

This bearded dude is cringe and his music is clearly tailored to appeal to the dumbest paranoid impulses of conservative America. Look at these lyrics:\n\n>Livin' in the new world / With an old soul / These rich men north of Richmond / Lord knows they all just wanna have total control / Wanna know what you think, wanna know what you do / And they don't think you know, but I know that you do / 'Cause your dollar ain't shit and it's taxed to no end / 'Cause of rich men north of Richmond.\n\n>I wish politicians would look out for miners / And not just minors on an island somewhere / Lord, we got folks in the street, ain't got nothin' to eat / And the obese milkin' welfare.\n\nDAE care about the **coal miners!!* Won't someone think of the *miners!* What lazy red meat. The coal industry employs about a whopping 38k people today. Yeah, the problem with modern society is definitely that politicians aren't supporting the *miners*. That booming mining industry. And don't forget EPSTEIN'S ISLAND EVERYONE!! That's where the globalist elites are drinking children's blood in a sacrifice to Moloch! Alex Jones told me so! Or something. \n\n>Well, God, if you're 5-foot-3 and you're 300 pounds / Taxes ought not to pay for your bags of fudge rounds / Young men are puttin' themselves six feet in the ground / 'Cause all this damn country does is keep on kickin' them down.\n\nCry me a river bro. Yeah it's the country's fault you're discouraged to the point of suicide. Grow up.  \n\nDude has another lyric saying that he's working overtime hours for \"bullshit pay\". Ok bro well welcome to capitalism. Maybe stop complaining and start pullin' on those bootstraps. I'm sure the last thing you want is for the left to get their way and raise the minimum wage.

I can still remember my brother holding the album and saying \" You gotta listen to this!\". We were used to those pop compilations with the year in the title. My mom had Cat Stevens albums, and Paul Simon... bands i would learn to appreciate only as an adult. \"Careful, this... this is different\" my brother said, and... fuck! I wasn't used to this freaking agressive album with people screaming and cursing. Man, that messed me up, for ever! \n\nAfter that session i think i was truly truly into music. I started to discover bands on my own. And actually even distancing myself, musically i mean, from my brother, who till that point was the one showing me things. I discovered Green Day, Pearl Jam, Bush, Nirvana, Radiohead...  Silverchair, Nine Inch Nails, Sigur Ros, Tool, Deftones, Korn, Audioslave, Linea 77, The Mars Volta for godsakes! and so on, and so on.... all this and more thanks to this Smash album.

ZZ Top, Bad Company, Aerosmith, Styx and Thin Lizzy were probably too 5 in my adolescence. Mom listened to Bob Seger, James Taylor, Bruce Springsteen and Simon & Garfunkel. I remember finding David Bowie\u2019s Ziggy Stardust cassette and just being mesmerized. \n\n\nI was mainly into music my parents mostly listened to and radio until I was in middle school. I was simultaneously pulled backwards and forwards. Talking to another kid about music, he lent me Led Zeppelin II, Black Sabbath We Sold Our Soul For Rock and Roll and The Doors Greatest Hits. Around the same time, I heard Slayer and Pantera for the first time. Grunge was just hitting the radio and MTV and Nirvana quickly became my favorite band. \n\n\nI was being pulled in so many directions musically. It was amazing. The Beatles Sgt Peppers, Alice In Chains Dirt and Slayer Seasons of the Abyss could get picked out of my giant binder of CDs. My collection exploded due to BMG and Columbia House having their buy 1, get 7 free CDs. I still have most of those.

I remember being so moved by certain melodies and that\u2019s when I truly began noticing the music around me - certain songs on the radio, worship songs, music in films. I would start taping my favorite songs (radio to cassette) and began sneaking CDs from my parents - compilations with ballads, christian rock, all kinds of stuff. One of these compilations had \u201cA Sorta Fairytale\u201d by Tori Amos and thus my own musical endeavors began.

I found A Kiss In The Dreamhouse on cassette then on CD and obsessively listen to it.

Danielle Dax was the other artist I couldn\u2019t get enough of after I heard the song Whistling for His Love. Jesus Egg That Wept is my favorite album of hers. There is so much music out there.

That song got me hooked and I started buying singles like Bowie, T Rex with my pocket money until I saved up to buy Jailbreak by Thin Lizzy. It\u2019s still in my top 10 and I still listen to it now. That got me into Zeppelin, Floyd, Sabbath and all the other great rock bands and artists of the time.

I'm from Latin America, so I already was introduced to great music but in my language. For that same reason, 1 of the 2 songs (yes, they were 2) we chose was a Daddy Yankee one. However, the other one, weirdly enough and which I still can't remember who picked it, was \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\" by Green Day. \nI went home and listened to it on my own cause I thought it was kind of a cool song. \n \nYears went by and I kept hearing it on the radio from time to time, always reminiscing on that time and how cool I thought the song was. \n\nThen, at the beginning of highschool I said: \"fuck it! Green Day is such a big name and they made this hell of a song??? I gotta listen to more!\" I think because it came on again on the radio or sth. So I did it and rediscovered many songs from my childhood like \"Wake Me Up When September Ends\" and \"American Idiot\". The best decision I made cause that song built my entire music taste, or at least was my starting point.\n\nI did get into the Red Hot Chilli Peppers at the same time tho, cause someone played \"Dani California\" while hanging out with friends and I immeadiately recognise it from hearing it on the radio as a kid. Tho everyone was singing the lyrics to Californication, so I got a little confused when I searched it afterwards. It wasn't that hard cause it was the other song with California in it lol. I also figured that if they did that one they had to have made that other song that sounded like it. Luckily it was the next one I played (it was \"Snow\" btw). \n\nSo idk if Green Day were the ones that really got me into music, but from the songs I started liking 1st, they had the 1 I knew the earliest by tittle and everything",

It has nothing to do with bends and moans. Flight of the Bumblebee has none of that, and yet it's stirring. The William Tell Overture has none of that, and it's stirring. Bolero has none of that, and yet it has a sense of movement.

Is Death Metal particularly expressive ?  I think I'd have to listen to more of it to make that determination (and would rather not listen to more of it, thanks).  Is Thrash or punk expressive  ?   I mean, it's not Satchmo belting out Wonderful World, but if you're paying close attention or really into it, there's definitely a different overall tone and expression between like Four Horsemen and Suicidal.   Again, it's not exactly staring into a Rembrandt, but the expressions are there. \n\nDo I play metal ? Maybe ?  Rush, Metallia, RATM (is that metal ? punk ? Hardocre ? ) and of course for decades stuff like Minor Threat, Bad Brains and who hasn't picked up a guitar and tried War Pigs at least once ? Or for that matter, just a simple Heartbreaker.  Weren't Zep once \"metal\" ?  Communication Breakdown certainly had its share of slide barre 5ths around, chugging muted low strings, etc.  Metal ? No metal ?  Premium Alloy ?",

For me, the age old question of technicality vs. attitude is very much a tightrope to walk but it comes down to a simple question of playing what suits the song / music. I remember years ago, friends of mine would play me some (insert 80\u2019s guitar virtuoso) and yes, it was technically mind blowing but you\u2019d get to a (relatively) ballad type song and they\u2019d suddenly start playing 1000mph for no good purpose and what\u2019s worse is the music behind what he\u2019s showboating over hasn\u2019t gone with them and plods along, rendering the whole thing frankly ludicrous and leaving me totally cold. Sometimes it\u2019s what you don\u2019t play that counts. But you take a band like Mastodon, all of whom are brilliant, technical musicians and that same technicality is massively exciting because all the band are playing off each other and turning on a dime, pummelling you into submission. Not a metal band as such but go and listen to King Crimson\u2019s live Elektrik album version of Larks Tongues IV and it\u2019s a similar thing, it\u2019s ALL about the technicality but the WHOLE band is ripping it up.

Nope because sometimes pure attitude is purely appropriate (and of course that whole Raw Power album is fucking phenomenal). Does it move me more than Gilmour playing Comfortably Numb or Wish You Were Here? No, because sometimes laying back and having one single bend in a solo take you where the song wants you to go is what is required. It\u2019s all about playing what the music merits as a whole. If metal guitarists (as a general term) could do with learning anything, it is this. Don\u2019t play fast aaaall the time unless it is what the mistress muse is instructing you to do. Tension and release, ebb and flow. Feel it then play it\u2026 I\u2019ve gone off on one sorry",
                "I have nothing against metal or anything like that, but personally I\u2019ve never gotten chills from metal guitar, as I have with something like Pink Floyd.\n\nMetal makes me move\n\n\u201cJazz/blues\u201d makes me feel",
                "Music is good. I am in awe of people who can make music professionally. \n\nI'm a pretty decent singer and a very poor guitarist. I watch something like the Beatles documentary, where Paul McCartney goes from noodling on the piano to suddenly playing Let it Be for the first time, and I feel like I'm watching dark wizardry.\n\nThat said... not all music is personally appealing to me.\n\nI don't like (most) country music... I don't like dance music. People like Beyonce or Rhianna or Madonna are amazingly talented, but their songs just don't resonate for me.\n\nI'd never say they aren't talented, or that their music is somehow lacking in skill or feel or whatever... it's just not my particular cup of tea.\n\nTo suggest any one genre is inferior to another sounds like pretty basic snobbery to me.",
                "It\u2019s hard to criticize a genre of music you don\u2019t listen to. For me, metal is something that when i hear it, it doesn\u2019t leave me wanting to hear more. \n\nFrom an outside listeners perspective, it seems like it expresses only a narrow range of human emotion, anger and rage. Compared to classical music, for example which spans the whole spectrum of feelings from the gentlest lullaby to the darkest, most powerful orchestral explosions. \n\nBut again, this limitation may just be the impression left on casual listeners.",
                "Personally I find metal to be the perfect expression of the emotion of rage. There are so many non metal songs that can express joy, love, sadness and even anger, but metal perfectly expresses rage to me.",
                "I like it all.  Kurt Rosenwinkle to Glenn Branca to Dimebag to Buckethead, and anything in between, if it\u2019s creative and interesting then genre doesn\u2019t really matter.",
                "I never understood questions like this because good music is good music, regardless the genre. \n\nIt\u2019s like ice cream. I\u2019ve disliked crappy quality ice cream, but good quality ice cream I\u2019ll have in every flavour. Some days I like chocolate, some days pistachio. Depends on my mood. \n\nSome days I\u2019m in the mood for country, some days funk, or some days traditional Indian music.",
                "I honor all types of music\u2026even country (I know\u2026\ud83d\ude2e) Who am I to deny that if millions of others, including boomers, enjoy a certain type of music that it doesn\u2019t have \u201cfeel\u201d. The kind of music you listen to is the kind of music you like.",
                "As with all genres there are good songs but it definitely isnt my genre and the heavier stuff i might even actively dislike.",
                "Metal rocks. I\u2019m not a metal player, but I can jam out to job for a cowboy, pantera, Chelsea grin, opeth, meshuggah, and weekend nachos",
                "I despise the term \u201cfeel\u201d lol.  \n\nI could say jazz lacks \u201cfeel\u201d because I don\u2019t really feel anything when I hear it.  \n\nBut I could listen to guitarists like Jon Donais of Anthrax/Shadows Fall, Jani Liimatainen of Sonata Arctica or Jesper Stromblad of In flames because they\u2019ve all written riffs and solos that have given me goosebumps.",
                "I love metal and anyone saying it lacks feel isn't listening. I can appreciate it isn't for anyone but honestly it's funny you say this is coming from boomers when Led Zeppelin was classed as literally the first 'metal' band out there followed by the likes of Black Sabbath.\n\nI myself won't discount any song based purely on it's purported genre, I love a good song period",
                "LOL growing belief?! This opinion is as old as the genre dude.",
                "I respect the shit out of many metal guitarists and think to the average person they don't get the credit they deserve. I also have little to no desire to listen to them.",
                "My take. Metal is fun. I don\u2019t play it as I feel it\u2019s a specific skill set that takes some dedication. But I listen from time to time. Metal is energy overflowing and the dark \u201cevil\u201d aesthetic taken to the extreme. I like that it\u2019s performed so seriously but there\u2019s room for acknowledging how funny it can be. Kinda like metalocalypse, it celebrates metal but also pokes fun at it.\n\nThe only metal band that is in my short list of absolute favorite bands is System of a Down. Their aggressive change to beautiful harmonies thing is so good, and they\u2019re just generally more dynamic than other metal bands which makes them so good imo. And as much as I can enjoy the \u201cknee deep in the blood of my bastard son!\u201d Pig squeals, demon growls kind of aesthetic that other bands use, I like that SOAD is more focused on communicating real world political issues in an interesting way. Like since they have songs about the Armenian genocide, their talk of death and destruction is very real, not aesthetic.",
                "I really don't mind some of it. Other bits are just wanking off on the guitar..a million notes in search of a tune,was what one of my old teachers used to say..then he said the same thing about jazz. I don't mind the stuff where I can hear a melody, but a lot of it just goes over my head.",
                "Really depends what you call Metal as it\u2019s become a very loose definition of late.",
                "I came up on metal, but rarely listen to it now. Never really wanted to play it. I appreciate the artistry though!",
                "I cut my guitar teeth on \"Big 4\" bay area style thrash in junior high and high school. Just learning those songs tossed in with classics like Sabbath, Maiden, etc. taught me a metric shitload about the instrument. So I appreciate that, for sure. I just don't play it a lot anymore. It doesn't feel genuine if I try to write something like that. I don't know why. \n\nI also grew up around Nashville. Eventually I got out of the phase of shitting on other genres simply because they weren't my thing. I slowly realized that, in Nashville, there were world class musicians everywhere that I could learn even more from. So I guess over the years, I've just consciously sought out different styles to try and learn from.\n\nI'll say now that I'm 50, I like the metal community, the people, more than the music. I still enjoy hearing a new heavy band every now and again. but I don't seek it out like I used to. But, IF I find myself at a show for some metal band I have never heard of, the people all seem familiar. So that's awesome.",
                "I like early/classic metal bands, but then at some point it becomes too technical/precise/clean for my liking. Personally I think imperfections in style and technique can make music interesting (especially if an artist is forced to adapt their music to their ability).",
                "Sometimes it goes hard, sometimes I wonder why it's in my playlist",
                "Who cares what other people think?  It's a musical genre the same as any other.  I don't like country, I don't like metal, among other genres of music that doesn't move me or make me feel anything. \nBut it means something to someone enough to pick up a guitar and learn to play some chords.  So if it's someone yodelling to some sad finger picking song about his dog being run over by a Chevy or someone who wants to wail away screeching while they \"chug\" their axe.... Doesn't matter.  And look at it in another way, if \"those people\", the \"boomers\" don't get you or are not hip to you're level of expertise on the subject of metal, who the fuck cares? They're probably not lining up to buy tickets to your show.\n\nHappy chugging my dudes/dudettes.",
                "I\u2019m 59 and while it\u2019s not my normal gig, there are days when I let it rip. Because you know, on those days it just feels right. \n\nI don\u2019t have any patience for those that crap on others preference. Music is supposed to move you. That\u2019s all that matters in the end.",
                "I mean i like bands like Tool, Gojira, iron maiden and of course classic Metallica but personally it seems theres also a lot of trash out there and actually if i want to listen to heavy music, metal aint it.\n\nI feel like in the stoner rock/alternative heavy rock scene there are much better bands that satisfy that loud heavy fuzz guitar itch. Currently obsessed with Earthless and All Them Witches.\n\nFor context blues,soul and modern jazz is mostly whats on my rotation.",
                "They all have \"feel\" . It's some metal and jazz players focused on technical aspects... like a video game. \n\nListen, anyone can put their fingers in the right place at the right time.with enough practice... But there's an aspect of improvisation. Something inspired. \n\nNot a lot of players embrace the possibility of sucking. It's ok to suck it once in a while and no amount of practice will ensure a moving performance. \n\nWhen someone can mechanically reproduce a solo or riff, it's boring. Why not just pay the jukebox to play the original?",
                "I\u2019m not at all into it but a mate of mine plays in several bands (guitar and percussion) and demonstrated the similarities between some of his favourite metal pieces and classical music (which I *do* like).\n\nHe asked me to name some classical favourites and then played them for me \u201cmetal style\u201d. \n\nVery cool lesson.",
                "I generally like listening to it (although I will say anytime I try to throw in a chug it has to be Phrygian dominant), but I'm more of a relatively inexperienced neo soul player that likes to pretend to play jazz now and again :).  It's just preference. I will say most metalheads that I've spent time with treat metal like a religion, and will almost always attempt to convince people that don't like metal that, yes they do indeed like metal, and if they just listened to more metal they'd find a band they like.  \n\n\nThat said I'm the same way with instrumental music so I can't judge.",
                "I admire the precision sweeping and scales for sure.  Although I don\u2019t \u2019feel\u2019 the music at all, any genre has it\u2019s own merits."

            "selftext": "**BE SURE TO SEE MY [COMMENT](https://www.reddit.com/r/revancedapp/comments/131beri/guide_for_installing_yt_music_revanced/jhzjzxo?) WITH ALL OF THE TROUBLESHOOTING INFO.**\n\n###**Things To Know**\n\n* Installing YT Music ReVanced is a similar process to installing YT ReVanced, but there is one extra step.\n\n* If you are from Canada please read issue 12 in my [comment below](https://www.reddit.com/r/revancedapp/comments/131beri/guide_for_installing_yt_music_revanced/jhzjzxo?) before you begin.\n\n* This guide is for non-rooted devices.\n\n\n###**Requirements**\n\n* Patience and focus. If not for you, then do it for my sake so I don't have to help you if you make a mistake.\n\n* Your device must be running Android 8.0+. \n\n* Your device must be non-rooted. If it is rooted, you will need to find a guide dedicated to rooted devices. \n\n\n###**1. Downloading The Prerequisites**\n\na) Download and install the [latest ReVanced Manager](https://github.com/revanced/revanced-manager/releases/latest).\n\nb) If you do not have Vanced MicroG, download and install the [Vanced MicroG APK](https://github.com/TeamVanced/VancedMicroG/releases/tag/v0.2.24.220220-220220001). If you already have Vanced MicroG you can skip this step.\n\n###**2. Checking Which APK To Download & Downloading It**\n\nOpen the ReVanced Manager. Go to Settings and scroll to the bottom and check what the supported architectures of your device are, as shown in [this image](https://imgur.com/a/gZbMyEL).\n\nNow go to [this link on APKMirror.com](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/google-inc/youtube-music/youtube-music-6-10-52-release/#downloads) and download the 6.10.52 APK that corresponds to your device's architecture, as pointed out in [this image](https://imgur.com/a/zI1Gfr3).\n\nDo not install the APK.\n\nBefore you continue, delete the YT Music ReVanced app from your device if you have one installed. (Make sure it is not installed in an alternate user profile or Private Folder that your device features.)\n\n###**3. Patching The APK**\n\n**If you get stuck during any of the following steps be sure to read my [comment with all of the troubleshooting information](https://www.reddit.com/r/revancedapp/comments/131beri/guide_for_installing_yt_music_revanced/jhzjzxo?).**\n\nOpen the ReVanced Manager. Open the Patcher > Select an application > **STORAGE**, and then select the YouTube Music APK that you just downloaded from APKmirror.\n\nNow press \"Select patches\", and then select the **Default** patches button, as shown in [this image](https://imgur.com/a/KzO4FlU). Do **NOT** include any patches that are not recommended.\n\n(If you decide to not include all of the Default / Recommended patches, you still **MUST** include the `Vanced MicroG Support` patch.)\n\nWhen you are done selecting the patches that you want, press \"Done\" and then press \"Patch\". It may take several minutes for the patches to apply. Do not exit the app. \n\n(Optional but recommended) \nWhen it is finished patching you can save the APK as a file so that you have it for later use such as sharing it or to save you the trouble of needing to patch again if you get an installation error. To do this, tap the three dots in the upper right corner of the screen and then press \"Export APK\" as shown in [this image](https://imgur.com/a/JqmfzAj). Then press \"Save\".\n\n###**4. Installation**\n\nWhen it is done patching press \"Install\" and wait for it to finish installing. You may get a message saying that the installation was blocked because it is an unknown app. Tap **\"More details\"** and then press **\"Install anyway\"** as shown in [this image](https://imgur.com/a/iLP2m7l).\n\n###**5. Additional Setup**\n\n* **Open links by default**\n\nTo have it so that when you click a YouTube Music link it opens it in the YT Music ReVanced app instead of the vanilla YouTube Music app, go to App Info of YT Music Revanced > Set as default > Open supported links, **On**. \n\nThen go back to the previous page. Tap \"Supported web addresses\" > turn them all **On**. You may have to disable these settings for the vanilla YouTube Music app as well, or you may even need to uninstall it. \n\n(If you are on MIUI it's a bit more complicated to set up the default links, but I can help you if you need.)\n\n* **Android Auto Setup**\n\n**Note:** From my experience and from what I heard, the YT Music ReVanced home screen will not load on Android Auto. But you can start a song, playlist, or album from the app on your phone and then you can control it from Android Auto.\n\nHere's how to set it up:\n\na) You need to have included the `Bypass Certificate Checks` patch when you patched the app.\n\nb) Once you have it installed with that patch, go to the Android Auto settings on your device.\n\nc) Scroll down to \"Version and permission info\".\n\nd) Tap on it 10 times to enter developer mode and then tap \"OK\" on the popup.\n\ne) Tap the 3 dots in the upper-right corner of your screen and open the Developer settings.\n\nf) Scroll down and make sure that Unknown sources are allowed.",

                "##Troubleshooting Information \n.\n\n**1. Error: Non-root install is not possible with the current patches selection.**\n\nPatch again and include the `Vanced MicroG Support` patch.\n\n\n\n**2. Error: Patch is not supported for this app version.**\n\nDownload an APK of the suggested version and patch that from storage. Refer to steps 2 and onward in the guide for more info.\n\n\n\n**3. Error: App not installed as package conflicts with an existing package.**\n\nUninstall the YT Music ReVanced that is already on your device. Make sure that it's not installed in a different user profile or Private folder that your device features.\n\nThe other possibility is that you are missing the Vanced MicroG Support patch. Patch again and include that patch. Make sure the patch applies successfully and doesn't fail.\n\n\n\n**4. App not installed.**\n\na) If there was a google play protect pop-up when trying to install it then you **must** press **\"More details\"** and then tap the **\"Install anyway\"** button. If you press the \"Got it\" button it will not install. [Here](https://imgur.com/a/Ck8nfhn) is an image demonstrating this.\n\nb) Ensure that you have ample storage on your device.\n\nc) Ensure that the APK you patched matches the architecture of your device. Refer to step 2 in the guide.\n\nd) Follow the first step in issue #3 above.\n\n\n\n**5. The manager doesn't register the selected (current) APK as v6.10.52**\n\na) Uninstall the vanilla YouTube Music app.\n\nb) Install the YouTube Music APK that you downloaded while following step 2 in the guide.\n\nc) Open the ReVanced Manager > Patcher > Select an application > YouTube Music. \n\nIt should now say near the top \"Current: v6.10.52\"\n\nContinue from the middle of step 3 in the guide.\n\n\n\n**6. Patcher is Aborting**\n\na) Make sure the ReVanced Manager is up to date. You can check and download the latest version from [here](https://github.com/revanced/revanced-manager/releases/latest).\n\nb) Be sure to exclude all non-default patches, and use a supported YTM APK version. Do not use a version newer than the one linked in the guide above.\n\nc) Get help from the community. Post a screenshot of the full abort error in the comments below, in a new post, on the [ReVanced Discord server(https://discord.gg/revanced), or on the [ReVanced Telegram](https://t.me/app_revanced). \n\n\n\n**7. App crashes on startup**\n\nSome possibilities:\n\na) You do not have Vanced MicroG installed. See step 1 of the guide.\n\nb) You included a patch that is not recommended. Refer to step 3 in the guide. \n\nc) There was a failure or error while it was patching and you installed the broken APK.\n\nd) The Google account you used to sign in has parental restrictions.\n\n\n\n**8. I'm having issues signing in to my Google account**\n\nThe following instructions will solve most issues.\n\nDevice settings > Accounts > Vanced MicroG > Remove account.\n\nThen log in again. \n\nIf this doesn't work then leave a comment explaining exactly what the issue is.\n\n\n\n**9. I'm from Canada. What do I need to know?**\n\nGoogle has made it so that Canadian (and possibly other countries') users that do not have YT Premium can only use the Radio feature within YouTube Music. You can only listen to playlists that are made by the algorithm.\n\nTo get around this you can either use a VPN to a different country, an [old Vanced Music APK](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/team-vanced/vanced-youtube-music/vanced-youtube-music-4-27-50-release/vanced-youtube-music-4-27-50-android-apk-download/), or you can get YTM ReVanced Extended, an unofficial alternative to YT Music ReVanced, which has a patch to circumvent this issue. [Here is the official YTM Extended guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/revancedextended/wiki/ytm-guide/). Be sure to follow the special instructions for Canadian users when following the guide.\n\n\n\n**10. Why can I only use the Radio feature?**\n\nRefer to issue #9.",

            "selftext": "My brother is 31 years old. In his time on earth, he has not had to lift a finger to keep any of his needs met. He dropped out of college after less than half a semester because he could not bother rolling out of bed before noon to take the car our parents got him to class. He's worked a combination of 2 and a half months in his entire life. He lost his first job at a dairy queen because he swore at a mother over the drive-through speakers, and lost his second because he got caught stealing from the till of a family-owned restaurant. He has spent the last 8 years rolling out of bed at 2 pm to do nothing but play video games and troll discord servers to find someone just as pathetic as him to hang out with. It does not help that he's an annoying, violent, self-centered brat who would push my parents in front of a bus for the thrill of the dopamine hit.\n\nMy parents always tried their best with us. They gave us everything we ever needed in life and then some. They have always been more than understanding to all of their children. For me and my two siblings who are worth something, it lead to incredible performances in academia, well-paying jobs, and an amazing start to our adult lives. I wish I could comend them for the 75% success rate. But, they have allowed the man baby to sit in his cradle and make demands for 31 years too long. And now, they find themselves with an overgrown toddler who sits in the attic playing valorant all day while cursing my mom out when she dares to ask him to clean up the rotting garbage he spreads across his room.\n\nLast year, dad had a stroke. He is now at a point where he needs 24-hour care from a professional. My mother is burned out. She retired when dad had the stroke to take care of him,  and it's done more damage to their relationship than 33 years of marriage could ever do. It does not help that they are perpetually harassed by the child demanding his dinner be delivered to him while he screams at teenagers over the internet.\n\nMe, all my human siblings, and my parents have been talking for months now about solutions. At the beginning of the month, we decided dad is going to a care center. Mom will sell the house to move to a 55+ community close to dad, and the man baby will hopefully find a box with an internet connection. Mom and dad have always protected him, but my guess is the stroke finally woke them up to the reality of the situation. Yeah, it sucks, and they are to blame for allowing him to get to this point. But, there comes a time to cut your losses and admit you messed up and move on. It's a shame all of the man babies' siblings, including myself, hate his guts. None of us care what happens to him, and it's interesting to say that out loud now that I think about it.\n\nI got the privilege to be there yesterday when he got the news. Mom's going to be moving in with sis till the house sells, dads going to the care center next week, and movers will be clearing the place out starting pretty much now. He has a month, the eviction process is already rolling. The non-emergency line already knows that his temperamental and violent behind has been served and is ready to respond if he does something stupid. Oh, and our firefighter neighbor will be over in only a few minutes if he needs his ass put in gear on short notice.\n\nIt was wonderful. His meltdown was legendary. He actually stomped his feet and screamed that it's not fair. Said he was going to sue us all, screamed in an elderly man's face saying he wants to kick his ass. He demanded to know what we were going to do to help him find a place to live, how much money we were going to give him to make sure he didn't end up on the streets, asked what he's supposed to do about the fact he was saving his money to buy a new graphics card. He somehow still does not understand exactly what he is now facing. He's now not talking to mom or dad, he's locked himself in his room since last night and only comes out to use the restroom and take food from the pantry that will not be filling itself anymore. It's great as my brother is staying there and working remotely to make sure he does not try anything, and to update me and my sister on the man-babies tantrum.\n\nI'm looking forward to the next month, it will be the best reality television I've seen in a while.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQuick update:\n\nThe man-baby has not gotten violent, luckily. He has made everyone's life a living hell, however. He says he's found a place to live though and says he'll be out by the end of the month",

            "selftext": "Hello again everyone! I never expected my last post to get popular but it was a present surprise. Anyways, here's the update!\n\nSo, after where my original post left off not much happened at first. The man-baby sulked and gave my parents the silent treatment until both of them moved out of the house. He had a bit of a tantrum when he realized that my brother would not be buying groceries for him and he would, gasp, have to spend his computer fund to feed himself. \n\nAfter mom moved out I think that's when it hit him that this was happening and no amount of sulking and bitching would stop the eviction date from coming any closer. He had a massive tantrum a few nights after mom moved out, he blew up the family group chat demanding we help him find a place to live and give him money for a deposit. I responded with a gif of a laughing cat and my sister blocked his number. He and our brother got into a fight, but like I always thought he was too cowardly to actually do anything so he sulked to his room.\n\nSkipping every little petty and childish thing he did over the month, he in the end did find a place to actually live. He started to do uber to make some cash while he claims to look for a job, we'll see how that turns out. Anyway, from what I understand he knows someone locally that he plays video games with and the guy hooked him up with a cheap place to live. And when I say cheap, I mean CHEAP. I ended up offering to help the man's baby move to his new place and got a first-hand look at the crack house he's now living at. He's living in a room above the garage in a 3 bedroom, rundown crackhouse straight out of Compton. The place has fiber internet though, which was the must-have feature for my brother apparently. I didn't get a single thanks for helping him move and he demanded I buy him lunch afterward, I left him hungry. \n\nAnyways, we'll see how long this lasts as the man baby still seems to insist on not getting an actual job and thinks if he begs me and my family for money he'll get by. He apparently has already nearly depleted his graphics car fund and is blowing my mom up asking for a thousand dollars so it seems to be going well for him. He did ask me for money when I was helping him move and I told him that McDonald's is always hiring. He scoffed and told me he was \"too good for that.\" I guess we'll see how long that lasts.  \n\n\nAnyways, the man-baby has left the building.",

Were all his meals prepared for him? \n\nIf he's that old and still throwing tantrums then he was never taught how to control his emotions and was coddled his entire time on this planet. He's doing what he was taught by action/reaction, which is how every human on this planet learns. He could've created a twitch channel, or reaction videos. \n\nRock bottom teaches lessons mountain tops can never perceive.

His growth was definitely stifled living with his parents for so long. In the end they did him a disservice by letting him stay for such an egregious amount of time.\n\nHappy for you And your siblings but your brother has issues. Good for you on helping him move out, but don\u2019t be such a dick about it. He\u2019s clearly having issues and suffering from delusions of \u201ctoo good to work\u201d grandeur. \n\nI believe he will come to understand that he was in the wrong in a few months and that he took everyone granted. Maybe I\u2019m naive or optimistic, like how I think all boobs are perky when push-up bras exist, idk, try to look for the good in people. \n\n(Insert one final inspirational quote)",

Chances are, he will have to go on Medicaid at some point.  \n\nAsk about Medicaid Lookback.  That is where Medicaid looks at their finances for the last, say, 5 years and decides how much of your parents' assets need to be spent on his care before they will kick in.  As a practical matter, your mother likely can no longer support the man baby beyond small birthday and holiday gifts (Mom gave $25/kid/event) without messing up Dad's eligibility.  \n\nYour mother may need to divorce your dad for Medicaid reasons.  \n\nYour mother may be young and savvy enough to handle this on her own, but you might want to see if you can sit in so that you can plan for what you and responsible brother will do or want to do once your parents' money is gone.",

We have to tell relatives not give him money because he's always working to get people to bail him out. We've already agreed that if he shows up at our door and says he's homeless we'll drive him to a shelter.\n\nWe've learned a couple of things about his mental health in the past year. He's bipolar and he's likely suffering from specific anti-authority issues. The combination of these, plus illegal drug use, is a toxic mix. \n\nHe got bottom last year and finally asked for help. He saw a therapist for a while and found some medications that seened to really help. I would just say, keep the boundaries up to protect yourselves but have a plan if one day he says he wants to change and is willing seek mental health support.",
