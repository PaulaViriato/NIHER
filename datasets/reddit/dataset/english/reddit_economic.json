It will open itself to being sued too by multiple different bodies it will screw over, so you can\u2019t just cut your losses here, people will be out for blood. Toronto will also make itself look bad as a host for future large world events and likely lose bids indefinitely.\n\nBesides, it\u2019s not about city council making money off FIFA.

They\u2019d arrange dinner with friends but would have to cancel because of rioting.\n\nThey said that this is similar to what we are now experiencing in more developed nations. Cities are wiped out because of climate-change-fulled wildfires, the middle class is unable to buy houses while working multiple jobs, and people are discontent enough to storm the capitol. At the same time, we go about our daily lives in a way that makes us feel like nothing has changed in decades (even though it definitely has).\n\nI think this is a defining aspect of collapse - it is not concrete and instant but protracted and vague, and requires deep scrutiny to truly understand.\n\nI\u2019d also point out that collapse is not necessarily inevitable. We can make miracles happen.",

                "I give Canada a year, two to five years tops. Caveat:  This is highly ancedotal from my own perspective, given that I'm facing a really strong possibility of losing my home before years end.  But I am definitely not the only person struggling and am seeing more and more anger on social media and in person. \n\n I left a big city seven years to return to my childhood home because of housing unaffordability and was the start of a trickle that became a flood of people when Covid hit  leaving the big cities for my area.  Now housing prices here are astronomical, definitely not in reach of local incomes.  Definitely not in reach of mine.  I cant even rent locally on my income - I have help from my mother and son but I have to in the back of my mind think about what if my mom dies or my son loses his job and can I afford this?  No.  The federal and provincial government are wasting a lot of time finger-pointing instead of, I dunno, working together to find constructive solutions (same goes for Healthcare), my provincial government seems to think the hot button issue right now is  gender-identity policies in schools while we deal with one of the worst housing and addiction crisis in the country, the federal government has opened the floodgates to immigration, but largely lets in highly skilled professionals who aren't allowed to work in their professions because \"they arent qualified to work here\" - the streets of large cities are filling with immigrants living in tents, not the Canadian dream they're being sold.   Our domestic production is diminishing.  I look at my son who works a small part-time job because that's all he can get and wonder why he can't be conscripted to work on some of these issues, we're lacking in all the trades but the wait lists for the schools are atrocious and the nepotism to get into the apprenticeships he is interested is rampant. I haven't seen a doctor in years because I don't have one - I'm on a wait list to be appointed one and the wait currently sits at 6+ years - even better my mother in her 70s was on the same list, called to check her status and found out she was removed from it at some point and had to re-enroll at the bottom all over again.  She also put herself on the local list for senior housing and that's years and years long as well.  Don't even get me started on food costs.  I \"make a good income\" by pre-pandemic standards and my fridge and cupboards are more and more bare each week.\n\nOne thing that I didn't think about when I first returned home but started to consider after experiencing several floods in my own city since I moved here, the hurricane last year, and watching the recent flooding issues in Halifax was seawater rise.  I look for the projections for Atlantic Canada for 2050 (roughly 25 years away) and most cities and coastal communities are going to be hit badly.  I think about all the people that are coming here in hopes of things being better, spending half a million or more on homes that were 150000 a few years ago, and how those dreams are going to start slipping away very soon if it's not already starting. \n\nI'm eyeing a potential move again back west.

                "It's already started. The global economy is very very connected and the economic collapse you are speaking of is already happening in Lebanon, Argentina, Turkey. Economic collapse means out of control inflation where normal citizens are becoming monetary experts because the ability to feed their families hinges on what they do with their rapidly debasing currency.\n\nThe global economy is breaking on the periphery first. So we have the 3 hyperinflating countries but there of course many sub saharan countries that have been dealing with this much earlier than those 3 countries like Sudan and Somalia. Egypt is on the brink of hyperinflation as we speak. \n\nSo the chain breaks at the weak links, but the strong links like the g7 countries are facing economic collapse as judging by the explosion of homeless populations, poor corporate earnings (the almighty raison d'etre of humanity), and out of control inflation (despite what the cooked numbers tell ya). There is an enormous global trade contraction happening with exporting countries reporting historically terrible numbers (not just china like the CIA wants you to believe) and with western corporate profits relying on those cheap imports, it does not bode well for anyone. \n\nWith every country collapsing, the rest of the countries get worse and worse, until the US banking system implodes as it is currently happening but kept under wraps by the powers that be. Remember Lehman in 2008, happened after the banks endured more than a year's worth of credit crunch and decreased confidence in banks' health. Now this crisis has been ongoing for over a year as well but this time what is losing confidence is also Sovereign bonds and their creditworthiness, and not just a country like Egypt but the almighty US as well. In this scenario our countries will radically change overnight and this is exactly what we need to save ourselves and our planet and I welcome it with open arms. \n\nPeople already thinking about this are working within the BRICS and their hopeful applicants to reroute global trade and business relationships outside of europe and north america, because they know they will have to contain economic fallout from this collapse better under their control and economic cooperation measures. I welcome this because it will be a fairer more sane system than the system we have, the unchecked rentier profits off the poorest in the world. A system anyone living in the west is beginning to understand very well, and anyone living in the global south understood all their lives. \n\nAnyway, in the meantime, protect yourself and your family, you will know what to do.

Then you see that the price of that particular item has barely moved by 5% (like all other items, tracking general inflation or even less) . \n\nI'd love it if someone was interrested to build a project with me whereby we'd put context on the disorganized and often meaningless flood of information, for instance whenever there is some crunch of electricity, our newsletter should also mention by how much the price has increased in a concrete and clear fashion, and how it is mitigated (subventions etc), when the news read \"x country had banned rice export, there is a drought in y country\" our newsletter should also mention how much that drought is estimated to impact the production, how much % does that country export.

Most places in the world have seen virtually no economic growth since then even going by the optimistic official figures...and at the same time places like Lebanon, Libya, Yemen, Syria, Sudan, etc, HAVE collapsed in full.

            "selftext": "# Due Diligence Report: AMC Squeeze, Economic Risks & Potential Second Great Depression\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Introduction:**\n\nThis report seeks to analyze the incoming short squeeze of AMC, current economic indicators, juxtapose them with patterns observed before the Great Depression of the 1929-1930s, and evaluate the potential for a significant economic downturn in the near future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1. Historical Context - The 1929 Crash & Depression Era:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* *P/E Ratios*: Before the crash of 1929, the P/E ratio for the S&P Composite Index was around 30. This indicated an overvaluation of stocks relative to their earnings.\n* *Monetary Policy*: The Federal Reserve's continued hawkish stance to tame higher inflation and *hopefully* market risks during the 1920s, which continued on into initial years of the Depression failed to provide the necessary monetary support that might have mitigated the economic downturn.\n* *Debt and Savings*: Consumer debt began to rise notably in the 1920s. As for the corporate sector, there was a trend of increasing debt, which made firms vulnerable to downturns. This was fueled by easy credit and speculative borrowing.\n* *Bank Failures & Deflation*: Numerous banks failed between 1930 and 1933, causing a massive contraction in the money supply. Deflation also increased the real burden of debt and discouraged spending and investment. The lack of diversification and the interconnectedness of banks, alongside weak regulations, made the banking system even more vulnerable before the crash and depression started.\n* *Policy Changes in 1932*: In 1932, the Federal Reserve did undertake open market operations to purchase government securities, thereby aiming to increase the money supply and counteract deflation. However, this effort was too modest and short-lived to have a significant impact.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt wasn't until 1933, with the bank holiday declared by President Franklin D. Roosevelt and subsequent New Deal policies, that there were more aggressive interventions in the economy. Even then, many economists argue that the Federal Reserve's monetary policy remained too tight throughout much of the 1930s.\n\nMany modern economists including Ben Bernanke, a former chairman of the Federal Reserve, have critiqued the central bank's response during the early years of the Great Depression as being inadequate and exacerbating the economic downturn.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2. Current Economic Landscape**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Household Debt to Income Ratio**: Currently stands at least 86%.\n\n**Household Debt to GDP Ratio**: Over 76%.\n\n**Federal Funds Rate**: Rapid increase from near-zero to over 5% over 16 months.\n\n**Corporate Debt to GDP Ratio**: Nearly 85%.\n\n**Derivatives**: Over $400 trillion in total notional derivatives across top 25 banks and their holding companies, with 60% being swaps and a significant portion tied to interest rates. The high concentration in interest rate products and swaps indicates significant exposure to interest rate risk.\n\n**Precious Metal Contracts**: There are signs of severe overleveraging in precious metal contracts, this is a sign of severe financial vulnerabilities in the financial system.\n\n**Personal Savings Rate**: Declined dramatically from over 35% to just 4%.\n\n**Yield Curve Inversion**: 2-year to 10-year treasuries have been inverted for over a year, with deepening inversion.\n\n**Bank Failures**: Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic Bank recently failed.\n\n**Federal Reserve Assets**: Peaked at $8.9 trillion in Q2 2022 and have since declined.\n\n**Inflation**: After a surge post-COVID reopening, now stands just above the long-term average of 3%.\n\n**Yield Curve Inversion**: Yield curve inversions, particularly in the 2-year to 10-year treasuries, have historically been reliable predictors of recessions. The fact that this inversion has not only persisted but also deepened for over a year is very concerning. An inversion of over 1 percent is especially concerning and aligns with historic precedents that often preceded economic downturns.\n\n**Net Unrealized Losses on Available-for-Sale Securities**: The nearly $100 billion in net unrealized losses across all commercial banks, with losses deepening since 2022. This signals potential asset quality deterioration and potential balance sheet strain for banks, which can impact lending and broader financial stability.\n\n[P\\/E Ratio Timeline](https://preview.redd.it/iwlp9cusy5ib1.png?width=1400&format=png&auto=webp&s=ec3ba1c3e06992e1ea033717d468b9512f2a3f05)\n\n[Current P\\/E Ratio](https://preview.redd.it/ipcihz1jz5ib1.png?width=1283&format=png&auto=webp&s=d9faa623fcf4dbdb4e7cfd680b7fc870bbaff85a)\n\n[Household Debt to Income Ratio](https://preview.redd.it/z1aucv2jd5ib1.png?width=536&format=png&auto=webp&s=f87e832237ab44a9b55ae4aaafd2a8a85b1682ae)\n\n[Household Debt to GDP Ratio](https://preview.redd.it/hgw93xn2c5ib1.png?width=754&format=png&auto=webp&s=4fc8be86692da51518ae98ddd09dec827ebe2fcd)\n\n[Federal Funds Rate](https://preview.redd.it/4l49nmd9e5ib1.png?width=1982&format=png&auto=webp&s=29234219866397e1c08704aabf43b89070c9afff)\n\n[Corporate Debt to GDP Ratio](https://preview.redd.it/m3ftb8cme5ib1.png?width=493&format=png&auto=webp&s=15ee7d1a1937fc732c9323434fea0534a884192f)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qo03o4vzk5ib1.png?width=2038&format=png&auto=webp&s=178ccb735a4b0cf2057a2b77f578cafbb626c7e9\n\n[Notional Amounts of Derivatives Contracts in Banks & Holding Companies \\(Includes Credit Equivalent Exposures\\)](https://preview.redd.it/c3or1e9xj5ib1.png?width=2037&format=png&auto=webp&s=7976e2f1d46be1ad22409e6363a12009c6133150)\n\n[Precious Metal Contract Exposure by Maturity](https://preview.redd.it/5pu2mf4mn5ib1.png?width=2037&format=png&auto=webp&s=3254a3f930414b1889bd9d4cbc2cd4cc67e63b1d)\n\n[Personal Savings Rate](https://preview.redd.it/53f1qiavq5ib1.png?width=1976&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f9fb1114d98c471d7ab2702af3e024366ca5e4e)\n\n[10-2 Year Yield Curve from 1975-2023](https://preview.redd.it/pu9ytoc5p5ib1.png?width=1976&format=png&auto=webp&s=141b24ffe8ccbf5a66785921230f2eac7c21e8ff)\n\n[Credit Market Debt to GDP Ratio](https://preview.redd.it/0t8xzfjlw5ib1.png?width=852&format=png&auto=webp&s=036f698dbe0cadc3b368df2b3f00832600e7a52d)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3. The Practically Inevitable AMC Short Squeeze**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe know that AMC is one of the most heavily shorted stocks in the market that has one of the largest retail shareholder base, but we need to realize that the current situation regarding the economy and how it relates to overleveraged short positions on AMC is potentially far-worse than some might realize.\n\n**3.II - Swaps, Tokenized Securities, Equity Return Swaps, and share locates**\n\nAs you all likely knew, when FTX failed in the second half of 2022, the cost to borrow immediately skyrocketed to over 1,000% upon the failure of FTX and subsidiary companies. How FTX exactly got exposure to AMC shorts we don't know, but we can point to the fact that AMC naked short securities were packaged into FTX and other tokenized securities with a supposed 1:1 token to share ratio via Equity Return Swaps and were used as share locates to \"borrow\" AMC from these swaps and tokenized securities. When FTX failed, it indirectly exposed AMC short positions were tied into overleveraged swaps and the resulting insolvency of FTX resulted in a period of scarcity in the amount of shares to borrow which led to a massive surge in cost to borrow.\n\nWhile it is impossible to pinpoint how many naked shares of AMC are in swaps, we can get an idea of the severity of the situation given the fact that over half of bank notional derivatives are in swaps, and swaps were used to hide AMC shorts and produce naked share relocates at a reasonable interest rate (until recently anyways)\n\n[Today's Ortex Data \\(CREDIT: jdrukis A.K.A. The Ortex Guy\\)](https://preview.redd.it/k84n8j9ct5ib1.png?width=828&format=png&auto=webp&s=dbfa30d1e81d97ae7c33030326e58d575cbc7b2d)\n\n**CONCLUSION:** While history doesn't replicate itself exactly, the economic patterns post-2020 display striking resemblances to those preceding the Great Depression. The combination of high leverage, speculative activity, monetary policy shifts, and inflation dynamics underscores the need for vigilance and careful personal and broader financial measures. In addition, the excessive leveraged used to naked short AMC and in the broader market overall contribute to the potential future crises that could take place.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn addition, the fact that the federal reserve has remained largely hawkish despite recent bank failures highlights to some extent another parallel that we saw around the Depression Era.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is why we shouldn't dance once we become rich at the expense of overleveraged AMC short-sellers, but it's something very important to know.

This cycle (dumbed down) grows exponentially until the following happens.\n\n1. Our government and central bank is replaced.\n2. *Someone else's government and central bank is replaced.*\n\nIn case you're ever wondering how countries like Venezuela or Germany (1923) got rapid hyperinflation, **this is it.** Demand violently increases **not by the consumer** but rather, the Government's need to meet its obligations. Anyone else wonder how demand is not going down despite rates going up yet. Do you really think it's your average consumer still spending like crazy? Especially when the cost of living is out of control? Yea, problem isn't the consumer. It's the idiots YOU elected which makes YOU inturn, ***the core problem behind every issue this government is seeing.***\n\nSo, how do you fix it?\n\n*You can't without a new government and central bank. Doesn't matter who you elect now, the debt is ballooning out of control and the means to pay debt today and later on by using the taxpayer will end in anarchy which, ironically, is what is needed.*\n\nSo, if anyone is ever wondering why inflation is sticky, it's because of the US government and corporations' need for capital, not the consumer. Since the US government cannot lessen it's demand for money without defaulting, their only means to keep value within the dollar is to reduce demand from YOU the consumer. Ya, that's right, the very people you voted for are leaving you with the tab and all the struggle. Inflation could be better too if demand was lessened from corporations however, if you haven't figured it out yet, corporations now control the government. On top of that, when you have billions of dollars, the interest where it's at today is really a non-factor in money borrowed. Corporations will just make the needed cuts to compensate for the interest so that their stock price remains high.\n\nThe cherry on top of this disturbing cycle are politicians giving billions of YOUR MONEY to a foreign country that you never asked for. Not only will this provoke the need for **more money** later down the road, but we literally cannot NOT afford to do this without jeopardizing the the financial stability of the country 5-10 years from now let alone now. It's almost like a plane stalling out in the air as it accelerates towards the ground. It's almost impossible to generate enough force to keep the plane up right when it is in this cycle. The time to break out of this cycle was in the 90's. As of now, we're past the event horizon of coming back. There comes a point where none of this is reversible unless we see an entire new government and central bank form (r e v o l u t i o n).",

The opening sentence is the WEF conspiracy theories have been debunked, with literally no evidence explaining how, when, or who they were debunked by.\n\nOpponents of the WEF conspiracy love to bring up how powerless the WEF apparently are. I'd argue having members in positions of power in nations around the globe and some of the largest corporations in existence is a sign of power. Also, if the WEF isn't some big boogey man, then why bother defending the WEF at all? Why are so many left wingers obsessed with licking the boots of this organization that is apparently helpess, but also serves no apparent purpose?\n\nIt's fucking weird, and I'm tired of being gaslit by the left for \"overreacting\" to an organization that is actively in bed with people trying to scoop up every piece of real estate in the world while promoting the degradation of the quality of life for the masses.",

Located in Fusionopolis, this nine-storey building houses a 100-seat theatre and production facilities that cater to the company's global production needs.\n\nThe building, which also houses Disney\u2019s offices for Southeast Asia, was sold to the Blackstone Group in January 2021.\n\n\"Over the next several months, ILM will be consolidating its global footprint and winding down its Singapore studio due to economic factors affecting the industry,\" Disney told CNA on Tuesday (Aug 15).\n\n\"ILM is giving employees as much notice as possible and offering opportunities to relocate to one of the company\u2019s growing studios.\"\n\nAside from Singapore and its headquarters in San Francisco, ILM also has studios in Vancouver, London, Sydney and Mumbai.\n\n\"ILM will be working with the local business community in Singapore to offer a job fair with companies identified as having a need for talent with similar skill sets,\" Disney added.\n\nWalt Disney earlier this year announced a sweeping restructuring under recently reinstated CEO Bob Iger, cutting 7,000 jobs or about 3.6 per cent of the company's global workforce.\n\nIt is part of an effort to save US$5.5 billion in costs and make Disney's streaming business profitable.\n\nIn a joint statement on Tuesday, Singapore's Economic Development Board (EDB) and Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) said Lucasfim's decision to wind down its Singapore operations is in response to changes in the industry and business conditions.\n\n\"The global media industry is facing disruption from rapid technological advancements, while studios are coping with challenges relating to talent and profitability,\" they noted.\n\nThroughout Lucasfilm\u2019s tenure in Singapore, the company has developed world-class digital animation talent for the industry through knowledge and skills transfer, said the agencies.\n\n\"Our Singaporean talent have worked alongside and learned from experienced producers, enabling them to develop their skills and play on the world stage. We are proud that Singaporeans have worked on Hollywood blockbusters such as Jurassic World: Dominion and Marvel\u2019s The Eternals.\"\n\nLucasfilm and the relevant government agencies are helping affected employees to find roles in other companies.\n\n\"The technical and creative skillsets of these employees - who are trained across roles such as designers, tech engineers and tech support staff - continue to be in high demand, both within the broader media industry and also in other industries that are going digital,\" said EDB and IMDA.\n\n\n***\n\n[v1.2 - error checks](https://github.com/Wormsblink/sneakpeakbot) | Happy 58th Birthday Singapore! | PM SG_wormsbot if bot is down.",

                "Rule5:\n\nI, along with my faithful ally, the PLC, fought off the remainder of Europe long enough for them to accept a cash payment to settle our disagreements regarding my need for Lebensraum.\n\nInfo about the run: I started as Dithmarschen, forming Hanover and eventually Germany. I control the Baltic Sea, Luebeck, North Sea, and English Channel trade nodes--probably some land nodes as well, but who the hell cares about those? After liberating some southern German pretenders, I found myself the target of Spain (No. 1 great power, 8k dev, owner of the entire New World except French Canada), France (No. 3 great power, owner of French Canada and about half of Africa), GB (vestige of their former selves), Venetian Italy, the Pope, and everyone else in Europe, excepting my one ally who stayed with me after I declared myself naval hegemon.\n\nI knew this day would come, and I have so much money, I built Level 8 forts in just about every province, but I definitely have a full fort line around my entire border. Through the course of the war, I had to sacrifice a lot of the Lowlands (sieged by 2-300k doomstacks). Other than that, I lost one fort through the course of the war. I built beyond both force limits and hired every mercenary band that was available. Slowly but surely whittled down the Great Armies of Europe into nubs upon the walls of my fortresses. Whenever a siege got to positive percentages, I would attack with my full force, and they would pull off their armies from all their other sieges to come reinforce, only to lose the battle before the other armies could get there. I'd retreat back into my lands, let what little manpower was accruing (4k/mo for this many armies is really not that much lol) build up, rinse, and repeat. I also obliterated their navies whenever they got close to my shores, so the colonial power and armies stranded in N. America were not a factor. Never had to take a single loan out--never even went into the red throughout the whole war.\n\nOverall, a successful war, and a pretty successful campaign. I'm the No. 2 great power behind Spain (trailing by like 3400 dev lol). Might play a little beyond 1821 and see if I can conquer the world, which I've never been able to do. :(",

Both at the street level with the cops looking for bribes and beating anyone they don't like with sticks (especially Muslims and people of other castes) and in the property law sense. You can legally buy a property, hold the deed and half a dozen guys will show up with some vague claim to the land. Hashing it out in court will probably take a decade because it is impossibility backed up. So you pay them off but more will show up later.\n\nYou will pay a bribe for everything. Want your electric hooked up? Bribe.\n\nThey took the uk love of beaurucratic paperwork and mastered it. Everything requires an application and an approval and you know what goes with that? Bribe.\n\nTheir politics is beyond dumb but so is us. They had a woman get elected to parliament who was a convicted murderer on name I'd. Modi is basically Indian Trump.\n\nInfrastructure is terrible with the power blinking on and off regularly. Traffic is insane. Rent is high. Public transit is shockingly inadequate for such a high pop density country.\n\nSome of the cultural ticks that make Indian white collar workers less efficient than other cultures include:\n\nIf they are given a task and don't know how to do it they just won't do it instead of telling you they need help or more instructions. \n\nBuilding on that subordinates will never tell a manager when things aren't going well. Building can be on fire and it's all 'everything's going great boss!'\n\nSexual harassment of female employees is in its Mad Men Era right now. I had so many incidents with managers doing things like cornering women in stairwells to grope them.\n\nRampant racist and sexist attitudes.

                "I think the one insurmountable problem that India faces is its inability to move human capital from where it is to where it is needed.   The United States, with the ability of its population to move from where the were born to where they work has always enabled it to be able to optimize its human capital.   Europe, seeing this, established the European Union, with its single currency and just as importantly, the ability of people to move to where the jobs are.   This  is impossible in India due to its caste system, which as Britannica notes, \"has been a dominating aspect of social organization for thousands of years.\"   Social mobility is essential for a nation to achieve optimal efficiency, and productivity.    Until India moves away from this caste system, they simply cannot compete.   Of course many other nations have faced discrimination that retarded their growth, the U.S. had its slavery, and afterward racial discrimination, Europe had its many wars between what are now peaceful members.   Neither the US or the EU are perfect by any means.   But India seems to be a case study of a society, unfortunately, too firmly rooted in the past.   Until there is a real and effective effort to eliminate the caste system, India will never reach its potential, and always lag behind the developed nations.  Some will argue that part of India's problem is the tremendous theft of its resources by the British during the time they controlled India.   That is true, but then China was kept in a backward state by Maoists, and they have been able to change.  India somehow must find a way to change thousands of years of thinking.",

                "I feel like India and Mexico both are suffering similar fates. Both countries have the potential (or had) to become economic superpowers, but as their economies grew, so did their problems. Both countries practiced what the USA, the EU, and China practiced: neoliberalism, but neither of them could become as developed as the three entities mentioned above. In fact, for similar reasons. Corruption and looting of state assets and government institutions by politicians, bureaucrats, and corporate leaders began to run rampant in both India and Mexico as their economies grew and developed, and as many have stated, India has focused on specific developments without focusing on the underlying infrastructure that makes the whole thing work. Mexico has the same problem, as they make shiny hospitals and highways every now and then, but even the largest cities (like CDMX) have really shitty infrastructure and you see tens of thousands of poor people living and starving on the streets of the supposed \u201cdeveloped\u201d megalopolises. I know a scarce amount of the economic history of India, but in Mexico, when neoliberal policies were implemented in the late 1980s and early 1990s by PRI officials, it enabled temporary economic growth but became largely stagnate since the privatized state assets largely came under the ownerships of corporations that had close ties to government officials (i.e, corruption, not unlike what happened in Russia during the privatization efforts after the fall of the USSR) and they established monopolies and that\u2019s why the only other \u201ccompanies\u201d are small shops that are mainly for localized areas. A few big names and companies became rich and powerful, but the rest were left largely the same or even more poor, which is why in Mexico you have people like Carlos Slim living near people who barely have enough money to buy bread. India, I have no doubt, is similar to this. Privatization efforts only helped the already rich and affluent and devastated the poor and broke.",

As for people claiming that their colleagues don\u2019t want to move back have to understand the bias in the psyche of the diaspora. Many were lulled to western countries under the vision of a better life 20-30 odd years ago. At that time this was probably true, and people left their families and their whole social lives for this chance. Now in retrospect many of their peers are being paid western salaries and living equivalent or better lifestyles (lower cost of living) than those in the west. Do you think the person who left everything to come to the west will honestly tell you their regrets in leaving their family? Finally, regarding people discussing future brain drain and how it will continue to increase are applying a 20th century understanding of Indian national pride/ identity. The young population doesn\u2019t view the west with as much glamor and they are proud to remain in India.

Infrastructure development is happening at a remarkable pace, and if this pace continues for another 10-15 years, the momentum gathered by the Indian economy will propel it beyond China in my lifetime.  We missed manufacturing boat in 1990's for sure because of the thoroughly corrupt Indian Congress and its coalition government.  Somehow, the IT boom saved the economy and opened up Indian minds.\n\nThese days startups are doubling and booming on a yearly basis and eventually, India will catch up on manufacturing.  There is enough internal demand, labor and now with legislative support soon India will project itself as a strong competitor to China.

I just got to know from don't of them that they all have been ragged by their seniors from the very first day of their undergraduate degrees. These are the same people who used to speak low of the college students in TN just because they don't go for strike against the management for some inconveniences and they would compare it with their UG days saying how big an issue they would have created of it. On the contrary, we would have raised hell here if a student or a fellow classmate had been ragged by one of our seniors. I've never heard of any tamil person of my age saying that they've been ragged by their seniors. I've found youngsters from Kerala to be more mature than people of the same age group here and i used to credit the extent to which they've let politics become a part of students' life, but after listening to this I personally feel that Kerala has let its colleges be invaded by these political parties instead of focusing on building colleges of excellence .

                "Gone are the days when the sole purpose of going abroad after graduation was to earn a quality masters degree and land a good job in a reputed company. The current trend is pathetic, I\u2019d say. The focus now is more on the NRI status and part time job aspect rather than studying, students are now opting for universities with sub par standards and opting diploma courses of 1 year duration rather than doing a proper 2 year masters program, reason? The 2 year masters program requires more work to be put in to complete the course without any backlogs, this also prevents them from focusing more on the part time jobs. And these agencies are glorifying this as if they\u2019ve helped these students get admissions in top 10 universities of the respective country, that\u2019s not the case at all, most of the colleges they go to are legit taking anyone in just to fill the seats and their pockets. There\u2019s a lot bts happening in their trend man, I could go on and on about it. I personally know someone who quit their decent job in Bangalore to do masters in the UK and is now struggling to even pay the interest on the loan taken, they\u2019re now working in a care home on part time basis, their mother has nothing but sorrow to share every time she visits us. Also, imo, this trend will die out soon, it won\u2019t even last like gulf trend which existed back in the days. Gulf countries at least had the resources to sustain the high inflow, that\u2019s not the case with the UK, USA or Canada.

An updated syllabus? Majority of the self finance colleges have immediate freshers as there faculty also.

With an average fertility rate of 1.53 for EU countries they have the challenge of balancing a lot of programs with shrinking tax bases. The flare of anti-immigration sentiment means that that will be a difficult tool to use to pad population numbers so I think the EU is fated to an overall shrinking population. \n\nThe fact that Germany is/was so damn reliant on russian energy seems to be proving very very bad for them and by extension the EU itself as when one of your biggest economies can be so heavily gut punched like that it will create ripples through the rest of the union which we are seeing.\n\nAs the US continues its pivot from the fosterer and protector of globalization to a nation that has a much more tightly knit set of trade alliances with friendly nations the EU probably won't be directly affected by that as it will be in that knit BUT it will be indirectly affected by way of relations with states that fall outside of that knit. I think this is the lesser of EU issues.\n\nCountries within the EU have decent long term outlooks. France and the Scandinavian nations spring to mind but over all I see long term decline for the EU and if it gets bad enough the EU will break and at that point it's probably going to get terrible given the european penchant for continent wide war.\n\nGoing into 2040 I think Europe will be a much worse place on average and in terms of economic activity than the US.",

Italy?  Spain?  They're lovely places to visit (and to live probably), but I wouldn't call them dynamic.

This means necessarily engaging with the US to a degree that its security is dependent on the US. \n\nThe opportunity for the EU is to make the relationship more co-dependent. The US will need to diversify its supply chain as well if the intent is to minimize the risk exposed to China.

The USA is also incredibly resource rich and has extremely weak neighbors that can\u2019t ever really challenge it or cause any issues. Canada and Mexico aren\u2019t unstable hell holes like much of Europe\u2019s neighbors. Therefore our immigrant population is usually more desirable and the illegals from Latin America are culturally closer to us than the Arabs/Africans/central Asians that seek refuge in Europe. \n\nAll that is to say: Europeans aren\u2019t having enough children, the migrants that do come are usually not the high skill labor that is needed.

                "You have read some articles claiming that Europe has fallen behind/is falling further behind because indeed there are lots of these articles. My point of view as someone who grew up in South America, lived in the US and ultimately decided to settle in Europe as a highly educated and high-earner professional:\n\nThere is some merit to the arguments. Europe's demographics are not the best, the tech-services industry is undeniably significantly smaller, and there are some structural disadvantages that the EU faces vs other significant global players (slow decision making due to decentralised political system, culture is vastly more different which makes it harder to advertise products continent-wide, lack of abundant natural resources, politically unstable neighbors...).\n\nBut ultimately, I honestly believe this is mostly blown out of proportion. People around the world, and specially north-American and English-speaking media, have been obsessed with Europe for a while now - the narrative of always finding a \"sick-man of Europe\" in American media dates back a very long time, as does the \"old world\" nickname. Europe still has one of the best-educated populations in the world. Demographics are bad but not nearly as catastrophic as people make it to be (1.5 children per woman in the EU, 1.6 in the US). Europe will continue to attract migrants from all over the world, and there's a virtually endless supply of very well educated migrants wishing to settle down in Europe. Most European countries have very productive workforces, even southern European countries like Spain and Italy have very good productivity rates. Natural resources although not as abundant do exist and the EU has the option to tap into its reserves if it wishes to do so. European political institutions, and the economies of its countries, continue to prove themselves more resilient than the yearly alarmist projections about the collapse of the EU or of a given member's economy. And last but not least, Europe leads the world in most quality of life and social wellness measures that are not GDP related. \n\nSo to answer your question: both Northern EU and Southern EU will continue to enjoy very high standards of living in 2030-2040, and even until 2100 and very likely after that too. The US may continue to widen its GDP lead, but in doing so will never reach the quality of life available to Europeans. Some people will continue to prefer the US, but plenty will also thrive and prefer the EU. China is not even close in achieving EU levels of living standards and education, and its demographic debt will come due a LOT earlier than Europe's. \n\nSo my view is that Europe will continue to comfortably enjoy its position as the economical second-place of the world (perhaps third depending on how you rate Japan), but media and people will continue to make disproportional forecasts about European collapse that don't come to fruition. The US may or may not continue to widen its economic lead, depending on how sustainable you consider their current strategy to be in the long run, but even if Europe remains a distant second-place in the GDP ranking it will continue to enjoy similar (or more likely better) living standards than across the pond.",

                "I have so many issues with the way people frame this question and respond to it. Problem 1, why is Europe as a continent compared to USA. Even a comparison between EU and USA isn't ideal due to structural differences and the fact that the EU does not function the same way the US does with its states. \n\nI feel like people forget are taking a single decade and using it to extrapolate the entire future, without taking into account for periods of growth during 2000's or years prior. Europe is facing some headwinds at the moment, especially in relation to energy prices. However, Europe can easily diversify towards alternative sources, such as renewables or Azeri/Gulf state/North African suppliers of oil and natural gas. Also the 2010's weren't an amazing decade for European/EU nations. There was widespread austerity measures, a Euro currency crisis, conflicts in Ukraine, Syria and Libya, and the subsequent immigration crisis resulting from those conflicts. The US in comparison enjoyed a stable economic and political environment in comparison. So understandably, we'd expect growth in the whole EU to have been lower compared to their American counterparts, albeit with notable exceptions from Northern European countries, such as Netherlands, Germany and Sweden.\n\nOverall, I don't expect the gap between these nations to expand drastically in 2030-2040. EU nations are highly educated, offer good opportunities and have high HDI. They still have room to grow, especially with regards to the technology sector. Tourism, luxury goods and other service sectors (banking), are still well regarded and easily generate income, so they'll have a robust means to continue growing.

Rarely a economy phenomenon is explained solely by politics and not by economic models and other reasons exist as well to explain this.\n\nFirst argument: there is the problem with wage disparity and family investments. In a petrostate, wages in the oil extraction companies are far higher than in other companies, so the middle class is much more willingly to use their resources in their youth to train them to a position for the oil company than in areas such as electric products or mechanical engineering. The smartest and best off people in this society will choose to maintain or to improve their conditions by working in the oil field, leaving the not very bright or the not very well off to other areas of the economy. To say that a oil company doesn't need trained people is a profound mistake.\n\nThe second issue is with exchange rate. A country with abundance of natural resources that exports the excess will have excess amount of dollars to the size of its economy. Such that buying manufactured stuff might be cheaper than internally producing it. Thus, industrialisation is slowed or even halted. To worsen the problem, as long as resource extraction companies are profitable, everyone who have spare money to invest on something will use it to buy shares of such companies or buy government bonds ; as there is little money supply leftover for other activities, interest rates become higher and anyone trying to estabilish new companies will see that is very financially hard to do so.",

From their perspective, You'd be able to charge far more off of each individual streaming subscriber than the $8.80 you get from the cable companies, but still less than the alienating-ly high $50+ that would drive away all but the most hard-core fans.",

OSU/Michigan is the most watched game every year and they have been pretty consistent ratings around 18 million.

                "Are the current enormous TV revenue payouts to individual schools sustainable? Most of that is based on deals with ESPN, which is constantly jacking up its prices and slashing its workforce. What happens to the big money in college athletics if ESPN dies?",
                "Here's the thing, the market will eventually swing.  Streaming content has essentially been in the startup, pre-profit phase for years for everyone besides Netflix.  These streamers have all been operating at a loss to build massive content libraries and be price competitive with Netflix and Cable bundles.  Now all that is shifting now that Disney and others can no longer afford to keep losing 100s of Millions a quarter on them.  Cable prices have remained relatively stagnant and are losing subscribers because as a legacy, minimal growth business they were not afforded this ability to operate the same way.  It's similar to what we've already seen happen with Uber, Lyft, AirBnB, etc.  I live in an urban east coast city and now it is almost always cheaper for me to use the local cab apps than Uber or Lyft.\n\nSome of the reasons for the downfall of the cable bundle:\n\n1. The amount of cheap content you could get by subscribing to a streaming service for comparatively cheap like Netflix, Amazon or Hulu who were the early players and got a lot of content for cheap because it was a side business off of the the main royalties from cable networks, then the investor (or just the massive corporate wealth of Apple and Amazaon) money that allowed them to become their own production studios and media buyers to rival cable directly, also at a massive expense.  The amount of content they are going to be able to produce is probably going to wain in the coming years and/or prices are going to massively increase to cover those losses.\n\n2.  Cable networks like ESPN gave you free access to live events anywhere via streaming for free with a subscription largely not tied to your IP address or subscriber location.  This allowed lots of young adults sports fans to use their parent's cable subscription to get access to linear ESPN even when living across the country.    This is probably ending in the near future as those old cable deals expire, so whether the revenue is from streaming or linear, ESPN has a lot of potential subscribers out there they were missing out on, just like we've seen from Netflix implementing their new policy.\n\nTL;DR: With new subscribers by tightening access and streamers having to increase prices and reduce content to cover their massive losses, the market should become more viable for ESPN and other linear media companies in the coming years because of reduced competitive cost pressure along with less choice of new content bringing some customers back to paying for live events again or more than they already do.",

It mentions ESPN+ is struggling for subs (25 million but most are simply carried in through the Hulu, Disney, ESPN+, +++ bundle), and there isn't much content on ESPN+ because big leagues don't want to be on there because viewership it low. That will change somewhere along the way once you hit an inflection point of enough users to justify moving big events there. Which brings in more users, which starts to churn it for better margins.\n2. ESPN has had to make changes and really trimmed a large amount of original programming in order to stay afloat and fill their slots. As you move closer and close to streaming exclusively you don't need to be on air 24/7. Which lessens certain burdens of propping up a network that has to function all day every day effectively indefinitely. Cost will still be monstrous for sports networks but right now they have to fill all the ESPN channels 24/7 AND stock the pond over at ESPN+. It gets easier as some of those fade away.\n3. Disney needs to get their act together with regards to software development. It has long been an open secret that Disney isn't good at software development. Be it their own hires, or contractors. You can routinely over promise, under deliver, and still get paid. ESPN+ is an especially bad user experience. Disney+ isn't exactly awesome. They bought BAMTech for over $1 billion. They bought out Hulu in the Fox deal. They've got development resouces they've squandered. Yet in the article Iger is floating the idea of selling off shares in ESPN to get assistance with \"content, technology, or distribution.\" They've got the tech, it is just being really poorly used. Buying more probably won't fix it.\n\nIt'll be interesting to see what happens. Someone is going to figure out how to ferry the ship from linear television to streaming for sports broadcasting. There is too much money in it for it not to be done.\n\nThat will be really tricky though and a pretty wild balancing act. As the article points out by 2030 50 million people are expected to still have some form of basic cable or a subscription to a streaming service mimicking the cable model for delivery. The networks are going to have to service two arms of viewers for a good while to come before they are totally freed from one of them. No idea how you even begin to navigate that in the medium term.",

                "This is called cornering the market\n\nIt's when you buy all of one type of commodity on the market to gain monopoly, or near monopoly power.\n\nIn real life it is incredibly hard to pull off because there are so many different parties involved.  You don't just have to buy out one competitor, you have to buy out hundreds.  It's effectively impossible to do at large scale, especially in modern times.\n\nIt was pulled off famously with onions in 1955 where 2 guys bought nearly every onion in the US.  They then sold these onions at a high price and made a fortune.  Once they'd sold all they reasonably could they shorted the price of onions and dumped the rest and made a second fortune.\n\nThis was actually such a clusterfuck for everyone else they made a law specifically to stop him from ever doing it again.  And so was born the onion futures act of 1958",

He then sold all 5 remaining fruit for 30 each (+145). Had he only sold his original 4 fruit for 20 each he would have made 80, but he made 145 by buying her fruit cheap and raising the price significantly because he no longer had any competition. It is absolutely an economically viable strategy and it is why there are laws in the US against monopolies.\n\nIt's simplistic, but it illustrates both the need for competition to keep prices in check as well as the potential benefits of buying low and selling high.",

                "I've played Eve Online in the past.  It's a game that allows people to trade things on a real market, with very few regulations compared to the real world.  This particular strategy would be known as \"cornering the market.\"\n\nI'm going to go out on a limb and say that all, of almost all the responses are assuming that he then \"obviously\" was able to expect to sell all of the remaining coconuts (or whatever those are) for the inflated price of $30, because no one else is selling coconuts on that island at all, the other vendor doesn't come back tomorrow with 3 more coconuts, etc.\n\nThat's exactly the hole in this theory though - sure you can buy up all of the supply and inflate prices, but you're making a *bet* about how many coconuts you can sell at that inflated price before *someone else* comes in and undercuts you again.  **It rarely works out in your favor.**\n\nThe real world is more complicated, because you can have monopolies / oligopolies on things that are inelastic, and difficult to supply.  Lifesaving medical drugs come to mind immediately.  Still, for most goods in most places, this is much harder to pull off than people assume.\n\nAt the point where he buys the three other coconuts for $45 total, he's down a $45 \"investment\" from where he otherwise would be.  He needs to make that much money back *in excess* of whatever he would have already made, just to break even.  In this scenario all the coconuts sold, so he would have made $80 total if he did nothing (4 coconuts @ $20).  Buying the other 3 for $45 let him sell 2 @ $20, and 5 @ $30 for a grand total of $190.  Minus what he paid to buy out his competitor, and what he would have *expected* to make otherwise ( -$45, -$80) he made a total profit of $65 by cornering the market so he could raise prices.\n\nWhen you see most people describe this kind of scenario in Eve, they will *say* they made $150 (5 coconuts @ $30) but that isn't doing the math correctly.  You have to look at the full picture of the original expected scenario if he did nothing, versus the full picture of the scenario where he bought out his competitor.\n\nLet's say instead of there being an insane demand for coconuts, such that the entire market for bought out at basically any price... He buys 3 @ $15, and sells 1 more @ $30.  (Because many people aren't willing to buy a $30 coconut.) Especially if he fully expected to sell out completely @ $20, he instead suffered a **loss** of -$55 ($30 -$45, -$40 expected value) because of the deal.\n\nObviously this math gets complicated quickly, but the ultimate reality is that *usually* the person trying to \"corner the market\" ends up in a scenario like the second one more often than they don't, where they are actually down money relative to where they otherwise would have been.  If they brag to you about \"making\" money, it's likely only because of faulty accounting.\n\nMeanwhile if the girl on the right had expected to sell 2 coconuts @$25, and instead she sold 3 @ $15, she would have only have suffered a loss of $5 by discounting her coconuts, which is potentially balanced out by having $45 at the beginning of her day, and being able to leave her stall and spend the rest of the day at the beach! (And really it probably is, because otherwise it was irrational for her to drop her prices to $15 in the first place.)",
                "Well, in free market- she will be able to get more and sell at any price point lower than him and be able to outsell him and still make a decent profit.\n\nBut it does explain the concept of monopoly to a 5 year old.",
                "I remember there was a post about an umbrella seller being offered to buy \\~10 of these $2 umbrellas. The guy buying said he was just going to go to the mall over and sell them for $5.\n\nThe first guy selling them was enthusiastic because he recognized the hustle.\n\nReally, it was probably because they weren't selling that good anyways, and the original guy gets a guaranteed $20 while the second guy is betting on selling 4 umbrellas at the mall to break even.\n\nSo in this example, she undercuts the other guy, but she probably thinks the demand isn't high enough for her to turn a profit. Let's say these melons cost $5 each to procure, if she sets them at $15, she only has to sell one to break even. When the other guy buys out her supply, she turns a guaranteed net profit (my example, it'd be $30), and can go home. The other guy now has his 2 melons to sell (2 x $5) plus he has to pay off that purchase (3 x 15) to make a profit. So, to break even he has to make ((2 \\* 5) + (3 \\* 15)) = 10 + 45 = $55. He still only has to sell two melons at $30 to turn a profit, but she was doubtful she could sell one melon at $15 let alone 2, so it's just a risk reward tradeoff.\n\nThe real evil is making a cartel where they both agree to raise the price to $35, and have one be $30 to anchor the customer at an insane price and split the profit.",

                "Not effective at all.  This is called cornering the market. The assumption is that I can control price by buying all supply.  This is a imperfect example of how it works and fails.  \n\nIn this case he sold 2 for 20 for forty and still has 2 to sell.  He bought 3 for 15, for a total of 45.  Then he raises his price to 30.  Assuming 15 is still profitable, let\u2019s just assume they cost 10 each.   He bought 4 at 10, 3 at 15, or 85 total cost.  He sold 2 at 20, and it shows he sold the last 5 at 30, total revenue is 190.  \n\nHere\u2019s the problem.  If he sold them at 30 there is nothing preventing his competitor from just waiting and selling at 25 or even 30, she just lost patience.  She gave up 60 for 15 in a fire sale.  I would suspect she would wait the next day for 60.  \nFurther, reality is that if the fruit sold at 30 so quickly it was underpriced.  However normally such mark ups lead to unsold fruit.  Customers are not necessarily that willing and desperate.  If he tried to sell at 30 and the local market sells at 20, people might make the trip.  He could be left with unsold fruit which will go bad.  At the above he had to sell at least 3 of 5 to justify the added transaction.  That\u2019s not a lot of room for risk.  The video shows it\u2019s easy, but assumes no lack of customers.  But customers can only tolerate prices for so long.

                "Let's assume 20 is market value at the beginning. Of course people are not going to buy the stuff when it's listed as more expensive. So going under market value (here she goes for 75%) is an okay strategy if you want to gain a foothold.\n\nWhat happened here is, that instead of getting a share of the market the lady sold out to her competitors giving them a monopoly, thus they can adjust the prices as they want. Usually they will try to stay close to market value or people will stop buying the product alltogether, hence only a 50% price increase.\n\nNow in the clip 1 fruit was sold at market value, 5 fruits were bought at 75% and then sold at 150%. For the guy on the left this means he invested $45 for a $150 sale, making him $105 profit.\n\nLet's assume the proportions are similar in real life this means that buying out your competitors at 75% of market value and then selling their product at 150% is indeed very profitable if you already have a share of the market. You can sell your product for +50 winnings and your competitors product for 75% winnings, you only lose whatever you sell at market value in the beginning.\n\nNow let's assume the clip was a scheme altogether since they seem to be sharing their profits in the end. Even then 83.3% of the fruit have technically sold above market value. If the market was left without adjustments the fruits would have gained the both of them a sum of $135. Instead one fruit went for $20 and the rest for $30, making them $170, which in sum is $35 more spent on the same fruit by the market.

Central to this theory is the assumption that international relationships are directed by commonly recognized, pervasive, and one-way patterns of subservience and exploitation. The interaction of independent and dependent nations creates an international system in which political and economic relationships determine the internal social and political organization of dependent countries. Theot\u00f3nio dos Santos, one of the earliest proponents of this approach, broadly conceived of dependence as a situation in which Latin American countries had their economies, and, by extension, their sociopolitical lives, shaped and dominated by the development and expansion of the economies of industrialized western powers. In his view, dominant nations possessed technological, commercial, and capital-resource predominance over dependent nations that resulted in de facto colonization or informal empire.1\n\n>According to dependency theorists, the deleterious influence of unequal economic relationships between subordinate and dominant countries brings political ramifications on the \u201clocal,\u201d i.e., national, level. Often an intimate association develops between foreign capitalists and local oligarchies. Consequently, capital resources tend to be allocated for political reasons in such a way that an economic structure of underdevelopment is set up, in which Latin American states are exploited by foreign interests whose concern lies mainly with profit remittances and the export of primary products.",

The team calculated the cost of climate change for varying priority systems, estimating the total cost including mitigation between 2010 and 2099 to be 46-230 trillion US dollars.  \n\nThe results show that the financial benefits of reducing climate change are often similar to the cost of mitigation efforts.

Livestock production is the single largest driver of habitat loss, and both livestock and feedstock production are increasing in developing tropical countries where the majority of biological diversity resides. Bushmeat consumption in Africa and southeastern Asia, as well as the high growth-rate of per capita livestock consumption in China are of special concern. The projected land base required by 2050 to support livestock production in several megadiverse countries exceeds 30-50% of their current agricultural areas. Livestock production is also a leading cause of climate change, soil loss, water and nutrient pollution, and decreases of apex predators and wild herbivores, compounding pressures on ecosystems and biodiversity. It is possible to greatly reduce the impacts of animal product consumption by humans on natural ecosystems and biodiversity while meeting nutritional needs of people, including the projected 2-3 billion people to be added to human population. We suggest that impacts can be remediated through several solutions: (1) reducing demand for animal-based food products and increasing proportions of plant-based foods in diets, the latter ideally to a global average of 90% of food consumed\n\nWe also cannot prevent 2 degrees of warming without dietary change on a planetary scale.\n\nHow Compatible Are Western European Dietary Patterns to Climate Targets?

Reducing animal-based foods is a powerful strategy to decrease emissions.\n\n>The reduction of animal products in the diet leads to drastic GHGE reduction potentials. Dietary shifts to more plant-based diets are necessary to achieve the global climate goals, but will not suffice.\n\n>Our study finds that all dietary patterns cause more GHGEs than the 1.5 degrees global warming limit allows.

Western consumers got an abundance of affordable consumer goods and a higher standard of living. Technological advances and new management ideas also moved more freely between countries, along with goods and financial resources.\n\nThis paragraph misses the key role industrial policy had in making South Korea and Taiwan into electronics manufacturing powerhouses. TSMC and Samsung grew strong due to habitual state support and now represent roughly 15% and 20% of GDP respectively.\n\nThe idea that governments should not make investments in strategic industries is a recent and wrongheaded one. Can't help but notice the countries who make such investments are winning.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the global free trade system was itself a strategic investment the US made.

                "*article:*\n\nThe world\u2019s biggest economies are offering  huge subsidies in a cutthroat race to win the industries of the future. The losers: all the countries that can\u2019t pay up. \r  \n\r  \nNew tax credits for manufacturing batteries, solar-power equipment and other green technology are drawing a flood of capital to the U.S. The European Union is trying to respond with its own green-energy support package. Japan has announced plans for $150 billion of borrowing to finance a wave of investment in green technology. All of them are working to become less dependent on China, which has a big lead in areas including batteries and the minerals to make them.\r  \n\r  \nNow, some smaller players are getting left behind. Many are nimble economies that were on the rise during decades of free trade, but are at a disadvantage in a new era of aggressive industrial policy. Industrialized nations such as the U.K. and Singapore lack the scale to compete against the biggest economic blocs in offering subsidies. Emerging markets such as Indonesia, which had hoped to use its natural resources to climb the economic ladder, are also threatened by the shift.\r  \n\r\r  \nIntel has been offered $11 billion in subsidies from the German government to build two semiconductor plants, in what Prime Minister Olaf Scholz called the largest foreign direct investment in German history. The pledged government financing is substantially more than the annual budget of Singapore\u2019s Ministry of Trade and Industry. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cLet me tell you plainly: We cannot afford to outbid the big boys,\u201d deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong told supporters at a recent political rally. \r  \n\r  \n\r  \nIntel CEO Pat Gelsinger and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz signed an agreement in June for Intel to build two semiconductor plants in Germany. \n\n\r  \nFor many tech companies nurtured in the U.K., growth lies elsewhere. British battery-technology startup Nexeon, which developed its technology near Oxford, helped by government funding, raised over $200 million last year. Its first commercial factory will be in South Korea, likely followed by a plant in North America. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cBut not the U.K., sadly,\u201d said Scott Brown, Nexeon\u2019s chief executive. Nexeon doesn\u2019t see that changing without more government support for the battery industry. \r  \n\r  \nAMTE Power, one of the U.K.\u2019s few homegrown battery manufacturers, has said it may rethink plans to locate a proposed $200-million-plus factory in Scotland given the difference in subsidies on offer in the U.S. and Europe. Arrival, an electric-vehicle startup, said last year it wants to focus its manufacturing in the U.S. instead of the U.K, citing the tax breaks. \r  \n\r  \nThe U.S., which is offering $369 billion in incentives and funding for clean energy as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, is seeing a windfall of foreign investment. German carmaker BMW just broke ground for a new battery plant in South Carolina. South Korean firms Hyundai and LG announced a $4.3 billion battery plant in Georgia. Panasonic of Japan is building a plant in Kansas. \r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n**Unwinding globalization**\r  \nThe subsidy race marks a step away from the economic integration that for decades broke down barriers to trade and investment between countries. \r  \n\r  \nGlobalization transformed once-poor countries such as South Korea and Taiwan into high-tech, developed economies, lifting hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. Western consumers got an abundance of affordable consumer goods and a higher standard of living. Technological advances and new management ideas also moved more freely between countries, along with goods and financial resources.\r  \n\r  \nThe model also had steep costs. Once-thriving communities in the U.S. and Western Europe were hollowed out as manufacturing jobs moved to Asia or the former Soviet states. Environmental concerns mushroomed as the global economy consumed more natural resources. Some economies faced destabilizing bouts of capital flight as foreign money flooded in and out. \r  \n\r  \nUnwinding that global integration\u2014whether for reasons of national security, geopolitical rivalry or supply-chain anxieties\u2014comes with its own problems, economists say. Especially at risk are smaller, developing economies that need access to global markets if they\u2019re to trade their way to greater prosperity. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cThe world as a whole is becoming more inward and turning away from open trade and investment,\u201d said David Loevinger, a former U.S. Treasury official who is managing director for emerging markets at asset manager TCW Group. \u201cEurope, the U.S. and China are in a subsidy competition and the losers in that competition are poorer economies with less fiscal resources.\u201d \r  \n\r  \nThe Western embrace of industrial policy could be especially painful for countries that had hoped to exploit the adoption of green technologies to turbocharge their own economic development. \r  \n\r  \n\r  \nIndonesia has ambitions to parlay its abundant nickel resources into a world-leading battery industry. But U.S. rules, put in place as part of the IRA, deny subsidies for EV batteries that contain large amounts of minerals from nations that are not American free-trade partners. Indonesia is among them.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWe have all the natural resources. We have the human resources. And we are a country that\u2019s a democracy,\u201d said Arsjad Rasjid, the head of the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, in an interview. \u201cPlease don\u2019t shut us down.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n**The winners**\r  \nAs a leader in the subsidy race, the U.S. is experiencing an investment boom. The U.S. took in about 22% of global foreign direct investment last year, making it the world\u2019s top recipient, according to United Nations data. That is slightly lower than the 26% it received in 2021 when global investment bounced back after a lull during the pandemic, but significantly higher than the 13% it got in 2019. Spending on construction related to manufacturing rose 76% in May compared with a year earlier, to a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of $194 billion, Census Bureau data show.\r  \n\r  \nIn the U.K., Nexeon\u2019s funding underscores the power of the U.S. purse to skew the playing field. As well as the private capital it raised last year, Nexeon received two million pounds, worth about $2.55 million, from a U.K. government EV-industry fund. \r  \n\r  \nWeeks later, two U.S. rivals, Sila Nanotechnologies and Group14 Technologies, both got $100 million from the Energy Department under a battery-industry funding program introduced in the 2021 infrastructure law.

The company is scouting investment opportunities and currently sees the U.S. as the most likely location due to subsidies that could knock up to 60% off a project\u2019s price tag, said Debelle.\r  \n\r  \nThe European Union is preparing its own support package, relaxing limits on subsidies member countries can give industry. By 2030, the EU wants 40% of the key technologies needed for the green transition to be manufactured in the bloc, including solar equipment\u2014a sector currently dominated by China\u2014wind turbines and batteries.\r  \n\r  \nThe U.S. battery production pipeline, which measures capacity from projects in the works, has jumped 67% since the IRA was announced and now matches the size of Europe\u2019s, which grew by 26% over that period, according to estimates by Benchmark Minerals Intelligence, a U.K. based firm that gathers industry data.",

Most investors in the past 5 years have been cashflow negative even before the most recent runup in interest rates and prices.

And if you work out the figures on how much properties would have to appreciate by to beat the S&P 500 (assuming 5% annualized real total returns) over the next twenty years, the numbers come out to be pretty ludicrous.

                ">Investors are almost completely absent from the Canadian housing market, especially in Toronto (maybe not so in Calgary). No surprise there, because the economics just don\u2019t make any sense right now. Consider that a new income property investor would be deeply cash-flow negative with 20% down at current prices and mortgage rates. While this was the case to a lesser extent before the tightening cycle as well, it was mitigated by the fact that ultra-low rates allowed a building of equity below the surface. Now, investors are largely cash-flow negative even on the interest portion of their payments. Unless, prices are rising at a brisk pace, which they are not (let alone falling), the case for investment doesn\u2019t exist at this time. And there\u2019s another thing: Investors can pick up better yield in dividend stocks/gov\u2019t bonds, with better tax treatment/no risk, instant liquidity, and no trouble with the Landlord and Tenant Board. One implication is that new supply is stalling, because investors typically help pre-sell new developments and bring them to the construction phase.\n\nI've been pissed about the politicization of our housing market for months now. I'm openly saying we're in a crash and that's what politics needs to gear itself towards, if not we're in major trouble. \n\nAt the basis of this thing *it was always a debt bubble* and the politicization of it made it way worse. Canada has a similar housing supply to the rest of the G20's, but what we have is a high house to income ratio. Speculative investing, along with highly under qualified mortgages got us here. Now all of the investors, including stock listed REITs, are getting crushed.People's retirements are going to be gone, their families are going to be destroyed, and there will be more job loss than there is now.",

                "My husband was born in the USSR in what is now Russia. His grandmother was a proud member of the Communist Party. He, his parents, and his maternal grandparents emigrated to the United States in the late 70s when he was a child due to his mother\u2019s concern about antisemitism. His parents are totally indoctrinated with American exceptionalism, consumerism, and toxic individualism. I love them but keep my distance. They are what Americans would consider very comfortable. House is paid off. They receive pensions, social security, and they have done well with their investments. They vacation in beautiful places all over the world. \n\nEverything has worked out perfectly for them. They aren\u2019t familiar with struggling. They came to the United States when the social safety net still existed and they benefited from it in their early days of living here (food assistance and medical care)The grandparents lived in subsidized housing (Sec 8) that was very nice and easy to qualify for when they needed it. \n\nMy in-laws don\u2019t understand that these programs are largely inaccessible, based on decades old outdated metrics, and they aren\u2019t funded well either. They don\u2019t understand how expensive the university is. They totally disregard how their free educations in the USSR helped them here in the states. My mother in law has had health problems since childhood that she would struggle to receive care for if she had been born in the states. Thankfully medical care was universal in the USSR and she received the care she needed to survive. \n\nMy husband was a registered Republican. He was brainwashed to think capitalism was the best economic governance system in the history of the world and identified as a capitalist because we own a home and stocks. Notice I say he was not that he is. All of that fictional nonsense has slowly melted away since Trump became the Republican nominee in 2016. He didn\u2019t vote for him. \n\nI think his frustration over the handling of the pandemic was the next thing to chip away at his former view of the world. He stopped watching Fox due to the 24/7 Trump stuff and the downplaying of COVID. Now he listens to CNN lie to him nightly\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0fIs that progress? He is starting to think outside of the duopoly of choice were given partywise. \n\nHe\u2019s starting to realize how antisemitic large numbers of people are in the United States. He\u2019s starting to worry that the his sons won\u2019t have the same opportunities he had at building a successful life unless he provides a significant amount of seed money and connections. \n\nThere have been times I\u2019ve wanted to scream at him for being so blind but he\u2019s getting it.

Not insulting or degrading me for growing up in a different environment, but just kind of showing the opportunities I was afforded that I had taken for granted. And just talking more and more, we discussed paths for change and equity, how to get everyone those oppertunities, they encouraged me to read Marx, and that was my real turning point. \n\nSo I guess to answer your question, my parner didnt seem to have an issue with it and they were able to recuit a clueless liberal to their side.",

However, as someone that grew up relatively poor, sorta failed laterally until finding self employment, and now making a comfy living - I can confirm that it wasn't hard work that got me here and anyone that espouses neoliberalism fundamentally misunderstands how wealth is actually made. This is important because we'd presumably want to build something together, even if just a home, and having someone actively working against that seems like a miserable relationship.

Which like sure, nice and all, but when you're having to choose between eating or paying your monthly bus pass, it's not helpful at all. He didn't understand how hard it is to break the cycle. He was always going \"you speak a bunch of languages, use that as leverage\" like okay bestie, but you don't understand.

                "No. Absolutely not. I actually actively get angry at Centrist liberals more than I do right wingers. Right wingers are something I instinctively avoid - even long before they became so openly fascistic - but I was once young, naive and ignorant about the center \"left.\" However, I am an older Millennial, so this was also prior to key world events (like the second term of the Obama presidency). It was actually during the last couple of years of the Obama administration that I realized what liars and assholes Centrists were. Obviously not every single Centrist is consciously lying or being an asshole, but I've reached an age and stage of life experience where I don't have tolerance for someone who is merely clueless and operating on autopilot as a Centrist. A lot of Centrists are just lazy, uninformed, or afraid of confrontation and I get that. I just don't want someone like that as a life partner.\n\nHowever, I could date people who are varying shades of leftist, from \"Progressive/Squad\" left to socialist to communist or leftist anarchist. \n\nLibertarian an-caps make me physically ill and so do mainstream Republicans. I can usually tolerate a Centrist as a friendly acquaintance if they're not too...too entrenched in their identity as a Centrist. Going back to lazy/uninformed/fearful - yes I can be friendly and polite to people like that. But there are some old white Boomer Centrists that make me want to gag because they are not lazy or uninformed but money grubbing, selfish old geezers.\n\nI'm grossed out by the people who are easily manipulated by the Barbie movie, and the sorts of people who are cheering on Zuckerberg for fighting Elon Musk ...like hold the fuck up, moron, you're being tricked into investing tribal affiliation with a corrupt billionaire. I keep seeing those people on Reddit, like \"Elon Musk sucks so much Zuckerberg must be cool to fight him ha ha.\" If they're not literally teenagers, they're a huge part of the problem with capitalism, not in any way a part of the solution.",

                "The problem isn't the existence of monopolies. That are plenty of monopolies that don't fuck costumers over. Like hydro quebec, which has some one the cheapest energy in the entire world.\n\nLet me tell you what the problem is. A monopoly gains bargaining power from not having competition, right? They tell customers: produce competition or pay a ransom, even if the competition isn't necessary to fulfill all demand, even if the additional means of production would be redundant. Well, that's the problem. It's the leveraging of the cost of producing redundancy. This cost is illegitimate since producing redundancy doesn't have a useful purpose in this context.\n\nBut it's not just monopolies that leverage the cost of producing redundancy. When a landlord capture a house to transform into a rental property, he also tells customers to either produce a redundant house or pay him a ransom. The desire to pay the ransom is induced by the cost of producing redundancy being higher. Building two houses to only be able to use one is twice the cost of a house for society, it's way more expensive that the initial cost of paying the ransom the landlord seeks.\n\nSo, what should be done about it? It's very simply prosecuting people leveraging the cost of producing redundancy. Doing this action is literal extortion as defined by the criminal code.",

                "Has these trends accelerated in the past decade? I remember a Canada that was so different. Canada also arguably has much better consumer laws. While the merger of Sun and Star media did not go through, let us not also forget that independent media has also eroded in Canada. Housing is another area .\n\nTo be honest - the direction Canada is going towards make more sense when we see Canada and Canadians are being thrown under the bus and being sold out by its elites. We have seniors working min. wage job and still not being able to pay their bills. How do a nation like our justify such tragedies? Why does our nation with the most potential sour so quickly? \n\nWhat I find annoying here is the suppression of innovation. Hydroponic farming on city owned land or even urban food production can be encouraged by cities thru by laws systems. \n\nThere can be also be independent co-op grocery stores which can help add significant pressures to the existing grocery store\u2019s monopolies. I mean - there are 100 ways to address the problems but there ought to first be a will. \n\nOur entire system was based on economic growth which itself was based on western dominance of international markets. We no longer live in such a world and Canada no longer can depend on its larger western alliance to secure its market and we need to stand alone and take care of ourselves. We have one of the most educated, diverse and innovative workforces in the world yet we are experiencing a productivity collapse but how can we blame Canadians? Those of us who have toiled and tried to do good are simply burnt out, priced out of our dream and told that we are too entitled and lazy. \n\nOur economies can bo longer be sustain by never ending growth fueled by the cheap labor and exploitation of the global south. For many Canadian, we just feel economically exploited. Grocery stores are a prime example - I seen a dozen eggs cost close to $8 to $10. While what was the CEO of Loblaws salary bonus? \n\nAnd it feels like we are moving into some feudal system where Canadians are simply being overworked, and squeezed out of everything and kept in the fear or being kicked out of their housing. Even those who own their homes are finding it difficult to keep up with increased mortgage payment. \n\nHousing is out of reach, food is ridiculously expensive - angst about artificial intelligence and the automation of jobs - \n\nWhen people and masses of people feel left out, there is a collective disillusion and disconnect. There is a collective loss of trust in our establishment and institutions - or fragmentations of our society. When our institutions fail us, our populace look for alternatives theories, sometimes conspiracy theories. \n\nAnd it\u2019s kind of scary that the metrics on the ground is flashing red across the nation and our leadership seems so disconnected. \n\nLastly - it\u2019s easy to think that what I am saying seems like fear mongering but think of the last major crisis like Covid. Here, the failure - at least per my own introspection was the loss of confidence in our institutions, and we are entering a world we\u2019re we will be hit with crisis after crisis and if we do not have a way to bring the nation together - we risk our democracies fracturing, splinting and fragmenting and in the end - we all lose, including the economic elites of this country.",

And even now, he could get the draconian sanctions revoked which would help feed the 90% of hunger stricken people if only he would stop torturing people in prison, but he won't, all he has now is the fear, no one respects him or even want him. That's why he won't.\n\nBut more important than placing the blame, what lessons can we learn from the Syrian war? \n\n1- the UN is useless, and Russia, Nato the West in general won't intervene to save lives, they'd only help you extract natural resources if you sell it to them cheap.\n\n2- Islamism leads to ISIS. Whether it's the Sunni or Shia's version of ISIS. That's the inevitable end point of Political Islam, don't think that your country will improve if you have some islamist political parties behaving normally and creating communities, their endgame is ISIS and they're adamant about it. They're a corrosive disease.\n\n3- Everyone should be more active in politics. There's no such thing as benevolent dictator. Don't accept the status quo just because it was like that for decades. Or because you tried and failed (Egypt). Despots (Kings, Emirs and Presidents) are humans like you (statistically they're much dumber than most) and can only rule over the ignorant, so make sure to awaken as many people as possible, to let people know their human rights and how they're exploited.\n\n4- Blood begets more blood.

Then the US invaded Syria and currently occupies the countries oil fields going so far as to create illegal bases there.\n\nIsrael has been conducting an illegal air war over the country for years.

In this conflict in Syria there are many truths. There is the truth of what we see in these videos. There is the truth of what Putin and Russia Today would have us believe. There is the truth of Bashar and his supporters. There is the truth of Al Jazeera. But all these truths are victims in themselves. \n\nBut more than anything there is the truth of the children of Syria. There is the harsh, bitter, inalienable truth that the world has failed them.\n\nWhen it looked like the current Syrian regime was about to fall, then Bashar was the dictator that needed to be brought down like Saddam, like Gaddafi - that was the truth. But when Russian help turned the tables, we are busy talking about how this is best since the vacuum would have helped extremist groups prosper - this is now one more convenient truth.\n\nHow can we even accept this last truth? Barrel bombs, chemical weapons and white phosphorus - Bashar has used all these weapons to maintain his tenuous grip on power. Mass killings, mass rapes, mutilation and torture, his forces have used all these in their reign of terror. But ISIS is worse you say - absolutely! But ISIS is hardly present in East Aleppo. And does ISIS being worse actually justify the Syrian regime's atrocities? \n\nMultiple ceasefire violations - take for example, the latest one where the people of East Aleppo were given the chance to move out. The narrative has shifted over the last couple of days but three days ago, when Russia first guaranteed safe passage for civilians out of town, the Syrian regime forces and their unofficial allies (and these unofficial allies are a veritable smorgasbord of Iraqi Shia militia, the Hizbullah, the Iranian revolutionary guards - I leave you to draw your own conclusions on the commonality running here) said they don't accept the ceasefire and continued shelling. That in itself is another truth. \n\nBut the one truth that we cannot deny is that ALEPPO IS A PLACE WHERE THE CHILDREN HAVE STOPPED CRYING. Bashar, Isis, the West, Russia, shift your blame wherever you want to, but the children of Aleppo will cry no more. 11 year old orphans with their 1 month old dead brothers in their arms will speak about this being the will of God. And that is the one truth that will grab our collars on the Day of Reckoning and chain itself around our necks. Syria will forever be humanity's moment of shame."

Republicans will blame everything on Democrats anyway and there's no sense to be had there. But climate change is now starting to wreck world economies, and this will only get worse. It will make inflation worse. It is already starting to destroy the insurance industry. We will face migration crises not only at our borders but internally.

It wasn\u2019t until 1928 that any President attempted to salvage the Naval Industry. Even then it was too little too late and the companies started up marking ship prices significantly to stay afloat which meant that the USN had to step in and build their own warships as well to keep prices down.

                "The question doesn\u2019t really quite make sense because the Soviet project was an explicitly socialist project. \n\nYou have to remember that Russia was essentially still a feudal backwater. The industrial proletariat were limited largely to the cities. As such, there were elements in the Bolshevik Party that believed capitalism had to be tolerated in the short term in order to build up the productive forces of the country (Bukharin, namely).\n\nThe alternative was industrialization carried out by the communists. Now, industrialization is a violent process by nature. It forces people from the countryside into the cities to work for wages under alienated conditions. It was violent in England over the course of the previous hundred or so years, and it was violent in the Soviet Union when it compressed industrialization into a much shorter span than was seen in other, more developed countries. Instead of capitalists doing the industrialization and earning the ire of the workers in doing so, it was the communists who did. This caused alienation among the workers employed in that process (it did not help that the country was surrounded and invaded during its crucial early years).\n\nThere is a world, I believe, where Bukharin wins the debate. There, capitalism would have been allowed to be practiced under the watchful eye of the state with a mind toward building productive forces to the point where they can then be turned to social ends. A big part of why this all unfolded the way it did was because Germanys proletariat failed in their revolution. Had that happened, this all would have been a moot point as Germany was the one of the most powerful industrial forces in the world.",
                "No one here has, so far, answered the question farily. Although the USSR state ideology was explicitly anti-capitalist, the question is not whether a conversion to an open market economy was likely but what would've been the outcome if this happened somehow. \n\nFirst and foremost, we must state that the territories encompasing the defunct USSR were very resource rich. Oil, metals, raidoactive elements, and farmable land were all under the USSRs power, to an escale similar and, in some instances, greater than that of the US.\n\nSecondly, depending on the time period, the USSR also bosted a huge and healthy population. An important part of it perished as a result of failed comunist oriented policies and ww1 and ww2, but be it in the 20s, 30s, 40s, 50 and even 60s the USSR had a very big and young population and a healthy fertility rate.\n\nLast but not least, the USSR had a very big and powerful millitary. After ww2, it was the most powerful on earth, and from there on, it was never less than the second strongest military.\n\nWith all that in mind, what would have happened with the successful implementation of capitalist market oriented policies?\n\nIt would very much depend on the time period and the scale of such policies, but the outcome surely would have been a much more powerful and economically stable USSR. Maybe the closest example to this situation   is the case of China's economic liberalization. Is up for debate whether this change of economic policies would've allowed the USSR to survive or thrive, but the facts are that the USSR had, for most of its history, the resources and population for being and economic powerhouse, not only a millitary one.\n\nMy bet is that the USSR would still be alive today. Albeit with another name and national ethos. It would also be the 5th or 4th largest economy. Maybe even bigger. Who knows, especualting is fun.\n\nEdit: typos.",

Overall, a mixed Soviet economy I suspect could have functioned quite well, a la China, but well, the implementation of Neoliberal capitalism caused one of the biggest humanitarian disasters of the 20th century during the 90s, and I can't imagine a USSR doing it to do any better than a Russian Federation doing it.",

That's the one real thing that let USSR and whole 1/6 of the Earth wide socio-economic experiment to happen at all - the rest factors were a total random. Plus one of the USA's biggest pushes to power was a lack of destruction caused by two world wars, so I feel if Russia wasn't hit that hard during XX century as it was - that would be the real key to success\n\nWithout devastating war Russia would slowly undergo some crucial reforms, democratise and, probably, federalise. Some prospects are saying that without human losses of WW1 and bloody civil war Russian Population would probably hit around 700 mln people by the end of XX century. Not China or India, but already dense enough to make its vastnes more bearable and infrastructure construction more profitable.\n\nAlso, Russian capital, with its huge amounts of resources in disposal would get so rich on reconstructin Europe after WW1 - probably Russia would be really hitted harder with Great Depression.

Although the USSR state ideology was explicitly anti-capitalist, the question is not whether a conversion to an open market economy was likely but what would've been the outcome if this happened somehow. \n\nFirst and foremost, we must state that the territories encompasing the defunct USSR were very resource rich. Oil, metals, raidoactive elements, and farmable land were all under the USSRs power, to an escale similar and, in some instances, greater than that of the US.\n\nSecondly, depending on the time period, the USSR also bosted a huge and healthy population. An important part of it perished as a result of failed comunist oriented policies and ww1 and ww2, but be it in the 20s, 30s, 40s, 50 and even 60s the USSR had a very big and young population and a healthy fertility rate.\n\nLast but not least, the USSR had a very big and powerful millitary. After ww2, it was the most powerful on earth, and from there on, it was never less than the second strongest military.\n\nWith all that in mind, what would have happened with the successful implementation of capitalist market oriented policies?\n\nIt would very much depend on the time period and the scale of such policies, but the outcome surely would have been a much more powerful and economically stable USSR. Maybe the closest example to this situation   is the case of China's economic liberalization. Is up for debate whether this change of economic policies would've allowed the USSR to survive or thrive, but the facts are that the USSR had, for most of its history, the resources and population for being and economic powerhouse, not only a millitary one.\n\nMy bet is that the USSR would still be alive today.

It's not even sure they survive the Great Depression (it devastated well developped economies, so imagine the impact it can have on a newly established regime trying to develop a backward country, mostly relying on foreign loans for sure) or the war with Germany, because only through stalinist policies of breakneck industrialisation Russia became an industrial power. So admitting they survive (by maybe sandwitching Germany with France during the Sudeten crisis), first their economy would be better today, not knowing the distastrous \"shock therapy\" that created a recession in the late 90s, corruption can still be as present as today, because nothing guarantees us that a capitalist Russia engages in massive anti-corruption measures to limit the power of the oligarchs or the nobility... Maybe they may have continued positive relations with their neighbors and America, seeing them as valuable trade partners, weakening the possibilities of economic embargoes or sanctions. So even if today Russia will be better off, the hardest past for this alternate Russia is for her government to survive the economic crisis, WW2, and to be able to pursue the necessary reforms against the will of the nobility (another point that makes communist russia superior is that their industrial development was decided by one person, or one group of persons, while here the government must ensure that the army or the nobility won't rebel at any reforms).",

They weren't industrialized in any significant capacity (though the Tsar was trying before the revolution) and a significant amount of their territories didn't want to be a part of the empire and were recent aquisitions or still culturally distinct. What held the Russian empire together was the Tsar and his loyalists across the countries that would become the empire and the USSR and then later collectivism under the communist cause. Without a Tsar and without collective action to bind them together the end result is that we more or less end up exactly where we are now but skip the cold War with the empire fractured back into the nations that made it and coruption rampant in the larger ones. It isn't capitalism or Communism that truly make countries strong. It's the people. Under Communism the people of the USSR were united in cause and so they were able to achieve an incredible rapid industrialization, hold back the nazi's long enough for a coordinated counter attack, create nuclear energy, and reach out for the stars.

                "This is a really interesting hypothetical but it's very tough to answer because there are two fundamental tensions that would have to be resolved to imagine a capitalist USSR like the one you show in your map:\n\n1. For genuine capitalism, as in a free market economy, to really work requires also a strong rule of law, which generally only democracy can bring about. In fact, often the two go hand in hand in a symbiotic process ([an argument](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-economic-history/article/abs/constitutions-and-commitment-evolution-of-institutions-governing-public-choice-in-seventeenth-century-england/2E0D2B2D3490BE5C556D836ACB096362) that was part of work that led to a Nobel Price in Economics for Douglass North). \n2. The Soviet Union, just like the Russian Empire before it, was an imperialist enterprise that used force to incorporate the non-Russian states on its periphery, and required force to prevent them from seceding. (And let's be clear that this was indeed _force, repression_. Look up mass deportations in the 40s in the Baltics, the quasi-genocide of Polish and other minorities in the 30s and 40s, etc.)\n\nSo you are in a pickle: try to liberalize in order to improve the economy, but thus strengthening those who don't want to be part of your Russian-dominated empire (the situation Gorbachev was in), prioritize empire over the economy (what the Soviet Union did before Gorbachev, arguably), or try economic liberalization but without political liberalization, where you will eventually run up against the limits of inherent authoritarian corruption and inefficiencies (the situation China is slowly starting to find itself in these days). \n\nPersonally, I think the most likely path through this all where we end up with a relatively wealthy, capitalist (rump-)USSR would have been that there is a more gradual transition from command- to market-economy that avoids the shock-therapy disaster of the 90s for Russia, yet at the same time leaves Gorbachev with enough strength to shut down challengers from the hard-right (the August coup attempt guys) _and_ startups in Russia (Yeltsin). As a result of the gradual transition from authoritarianism in order to strengthen rule of law, at some point some of the member states leave (the Baltics for sure, Caucasus states too I would guess, don't know enough about the rest), but some maybe remain (Belarus, parts of Central Asia, maybe Ukraine??).\n\nWhere would this goldilocks, thread-the-needle version of the USSR be today? Well, life can be pretty good when you have a democratic government that uses oil, gas, and other natural resource rents for socially beneficial purposes (like a less extreme version of Norway). It would certainly be better off than Russia is today. The economy is much stronger because it's been using oil and gas profits to invest back into education, infrastructure, other capital expenses, not for a small number of people to buy really big houses and yachts. Because in this alternative history Russia becomes a democracy, it would have aligned itself with the US and West, sharing values like rule of law and political liberalism. Yet while the economy is large, it's not spending much of it on defense, because why would you. Your main worry is China, but you've got the US, Japan, South Korea on your side on that one.",
                "I think if the USSR converted to something similar to Dengism during the second half of the 20th century, it would potentially still be around today. This and a less aggressive foreign policy (Ie not invading Afghanistan, preventing the Sino-Soviet Split, letting Hungary peacefully resolve its issues instead of sending tanks, etc) would have greatly helped the USSR.  \nEdit: I will add that this would have likely led to something similar to the 1991 coup attempt occurring much earlier than in our timeline. Whether or not this attempt would be successful would greatly determine the rest of Soviet history.",

This would allow for more natural development as farmers purchase their own equipment and contribute to a burgeoning capitalist market. \n\nEuropean radicalism wouldnt be as strong as the specter of communism wouldnt be hanging over them, so perhaps no national socialists or world war 2. This would only make russia more powerful as they dont expend huge manpower and material resources fighting the germans, and the americans have less influence over europe due to the Marshall act never happening. \n\nI think Russia would have a later industrialization but would be more robust than what the soviets did, producing more consumer goods and society generally being way more open. More people would have access to basic necessities like plumbing, people wouldnt live in identical commie blocks, etc. Also no communist china, so the cold war wouldnt happen and world peace might be achieved?",

Then a capitalist version of Stalin would take over, and it would play out more-or-less like it did IRL.\n\nI think the biggest difference would probably be around US Propaganda. If the USSR wasn't communist, then the US Propaganda Mills would not be pumping out anti-communist propaganda. They wouldn't not do propaganda, but it wouldn't be about communism.

Then you have to work your way up from graduate level, but a lot of industries are used to mature starters and often like them cause they are often less hassle than someone younger,  possibly a bit flaky, in their party years etc. \n\nSo if Uni is a path that interests you,  pull the trigger and get it underway.

These have clear career paths that can mostly lead to cruisy 100k+ jobs. Other degrees like science, arts etc are more difficult to quantify and really they are more dependent on your own drive to generate a good return. \n\nCould you earn plenty of money without a degree? Yes, of course you can. But usually it is quite hard to do, it is basically either building a business, which is very hard and stressful, working long hours in a poor work environment (think FIFO), or it takes such a long time to grow the experience/skills to be valuable that usually it would be easier to go to uni in the first place (self taught developers). It is still true that the most straightforward and guaranteed way to a middle income is education. \n\nI recommend getting a degree in something related to your experience (logistics by the sounds of it, believe these kinds of companies also hire engineering grads into logistics roles but you'll have to dyor). This will help you 'bulk out' your experience and more easily land internships/a grad role when competing with people fresh out of high school.",

What career do you want and how does the degree help? If you can\u2019t answer these questions, then it\u2019ll likely set you back- both because of the financial commitment and also because of the time taken.\n\nUni can be a great decision - even at 30 although the risk/reward is lower. Going in without a plan is a bad decision imo. Be smart and work out your strengths and weaknesses, likes and dislikes, and the job market in your area. Note these down along with some careers and jobs that might match these, and then think about whether uni will fit into this goal.\n\nSome uni scenarios I just pulled out of my butt:\n\n1 - you struggle financially for a few years, push through, get an entry level role in several years, struggle less, and then move up in your interesting profession over the remaining decades and are more personally and financially fulfilled\n\n2 - you sign up while unsure or for shits and giggles, end up with debt, no degree, and missed career opportunities after a few semesters\n\n3 - you complete your degree after a change or two, enjoyed the experience and change of pace, gained new experiences and perspectives, but it hasn\u2019t helped you in your career and you haven\u2019t used it much\n\n\nScenarios like 1 are much more likely when people have done their research, have some insight, and made good plans. I honestly believe that it\u2019s not your lack of a degree that\u2019s the issue, but simply you not thinking and planning your career trajectory. If you had the same attitude but had attended uni, you\u2019d likely end up closer to scenario 2.\n\nA lot of people have the \u201cwhy am I paying to be here\u201d epiphany at uni. You\u2019ve at least been paid. Put in some real effort into researching yourself and possible careers and save yourself a lot of heartache down the line. Best wishes!",

However, you do need to think about this A LOT more.

It certainly didn\u2019t make life better for the people living in the areas that were formerly Rome. That people living as recently as 1800 were not living any better than people in the year 0 is still mind-boggling to me.

                "Rome never fell... it outsourced.\n\nThe church of Rome evolved into the Catholic church and the Catholic church remained after the supposed fall of Rome.  The Pope decreed who could join the power elite via \"Divine Right\" effectively maintaining political control and collecting absurd amounts of wealth.  While those stupid aristocrats got stuck with the hard and expensive parts of governance.  The aristocracy maintained the roads and mills, levied the armies, collected the taxes, stayed on top of production etc..\n\nSo imo the guy is just wrong on a few points.\n\nThe fundamental soft power structure that was Rome continues to this day.  Rome didn't get rebuilt because it didn't need to, the power elite of Rome had invented a system to keep themselves rich and powerful without it.  Let the Franks deal with the plebs and work in the mud.\n\nNot only did other empires exist but two (three if France counts) tried to claim the name Rome for themselves.\n\nHis point about \"violent competitiveness\" could be also be said about Rome.\n\nHis point about navigable waterways didn't seem to hinder Rome, or really anyone else.\n\nAnd the big question mark he hangs around \"How did Rome become Rome?\" is imo dumb.  Rome became an empire the same way Russia later became an empire and the same way the Persians became an empire, by being better bandits.\n\nThey either wanted what their neighbor had so they conquered them, or they had suffered enough bandit raids to do something about it and conquered their neighbor to stop the bandit raids coming their direction.  Collect a few towns or villages that way and you go from chief to king.  Collect a few more towns and villages that speak a different language, and you go from being king to emperor.",

                "I don't know what this professor's specific argument is but I do take the view that the ending of Roman power in the west was a good thing, at least in the long run.\n\nWhy? because centralized power structures have a habit of looking increasingly inward and stifling toward innovation. Tradition becomes a straitjacket and when one single person has full authority over an entire continent, then they can also stifle it's economic, political, and societal development. You can see this with most great empires in history, the Ottomans, Mughal India, Tokugawa Shogunate Japan, and all the different Chinese dynasties. They all went through periods of expansion and growth where new ideas were flourishing and economic development was booming. But then things began to get stagnated as those with established power began to resist change. Okay, granted, that's a gross oversimplification and generalization of things in very disparate regions, but that's the general view I take.\n\nBy contrast, Europe's greatest strength, and what brought it to the top of the world during the early modern era, was its disunity. A bunch of waring and squabbling kingdoms, principalities, and city republics that were constantly feuding with each other. And that brought a sort of dynamism to development in Europe. The king who was opposed to new economic ideas lost out when the merchants moved to a kingdom that did like those ideas. Kings who didn't modernize their armed forces to create better organized, larger, and better armed central armies were quickly subsumed by their enemies. A man who has an idea to circumnavigate the world does not have his plan shot down when a single emperor says no, he can always ask other lords who will be happy to look for a chance to one up their enemies.\n\nI could go on but that's the general gist of the view that the roman empire's fall was fortuitous, again, in the long run. It left a wonderful legacy, and nothing that happened afterward could have happened without that legacy. But if it had stuck around then Europe would not have advanced enough to bring the rest of the world (for better or worse) into the modern world we live in today.\n\nN.B. Also, the roman empire was bound to split apart eventually. Just look at a map of Europe, it's a peninsula made of peninsulas with mountain ranges and large rivers cutting off whole sections of it. It's a miracle that the Romans kept this geographical monstrosity together for as long as they did.",

                "The real \"Dark ages\"  is roughly 530 to 800 A.D. It's called like that because the scarcity of written sources/books/texts for studying history in that period. It is something real from that poiny of view.\n\nAnd there was an economic decline since the V century up to the 10th or maybe the 11th with the short exception of the Caroligian renaissance.\n\nIn the 11th and definitely in the 12th economy started to pick-up(Commercial revolution) and evidence is clear: the building of the great Gothic Cathedrals and other things that compound what is called the Renaissance of the 12th century.\n\nAfter the vikings and maygar invasions finally Western Europe had enough stability to grow plus Byzantium(which was Christian and then closer to an ally to the West) gained control of Anatolia in the 10th and 11th.",
                "This isn\u2019t a new thesis, and echoes can even be found in Gibbon where he talks about the present day European state system (c. 1780) as facilitating human liberty and development by preventing an all encompassing tyranny.\n\nBUT, I think the thesis that fragmentation led to greater economic development needs to be counterbalanced with a rather simple fact: until 1204, the most economically, politically, and culturally developed polity in Europe was in fact the Roman Empire! And even afterwards, one of the catalysts of the Renaissance were the scholars and artisans from Constantinople taking refuge in the cities of Italy. So in that sense, the final fall of Rome in 1453 was a good thing for the west. Neither should we forget that the state system of Europe was prevented from falling into complete chaos by the institution of the Roman Church.\n\nSo with all that in mind, the thesis presented here seems somewhat suspect. \n\nWhat I would say is competition is a long term positive for development, only if it is tempered by the ability to acquire new technology and knowledge and prevented from turning into total anarchy (there need to be ground rules for interstate relations).",

                "Hmm strange, one can see how in the later Roman empire there comes a shortage of precious metals like gold and silver after mines in for example South of Spain and Dacia ran dry. In a way there had been an attempt to adress it by de-valuating the coin or at least decreasing the precious metals contents of it but because this created a situation where there were coins in roulation with different gold contents it led to hyperinflation. As a result, the monetary market economy of Rome deteriorated and payments started to be done more in goods, aka in a way it started to shift the roman market economy more towards some sort of feudal economic structures. It's noticable that while Rome had only grown in poppulation towards the end of the empire that from around 350/400 AD it simply couldn't afford to raise and maintain as much legions anymore as it once could even if Roman army strenght had hit a peek during Constantine's reign, and it  started to rely more on mercenary's that could be rewarded with land.\n\nPart of it was likely a large trade deficit with the east, whereas Roman emperors typically held direct control of Egypt and levied tarrifs on trade going by the red sea. With other words it likely was not so easy for roman emperors to stop it even if they knew what was happening, since the tarrifs likely made a fair part of the state income.\n\nIt is partly when Spain started flooding Europe with gold in the late 15th/early 16th century that we see a strong decline of feudal economic structure and a return to large monetary markets, which in turn allowed European powers to graduatly shift towards more proffesional armies again.\n\nThat is just my impression of it. Seems to me that ultimatly lack of sufficient precious metals production (in combination with how Rome reacted on it) led to a situation where Europe economicly really couldn't work so much or primarily trough monetary markets anymore which could only be aleviated with a large influx of gold either by a positive trade balance or plundering for it. This likely would have happened in some alternative scenario aswell."

Of course it's understandable how a black man in SA would develop a hatred for white people owing to the centuries of enslavement and apartheid. Black Nationalism is **fundamentally incomparable** to White Supremacy (unlike some who don't deserve the title of \"Marxists\" foolishly claim).

That coalition could not have been maintained with a unifying opponent (the apartheid state) or personalities to hold it together (Mandela.)\n\nSo the ANC's elements shook out. Mbeki rose and fell on the ANC's (black but pro-Freedom Charter and explicitly multi-racial) Right and much of the force around him moved into COPE.\n\nMuch of the Coloured and Indian communities without a specific struggle history and the Cape shook out into the DA.\n\nMuch of the post-National Party that had an ideological commitment to Boerdom is in the FF+.\n\nThose most specifically oriented to the struggle in the Frontline states, with an insurgent and revolutionary redistributionist analysis, including a lot of those younger in the transition (Malema himself was ANCYL) shook out into EFF.\n\nI am personally sympathetic to the NUMSA above all, but I can see how the EFF and the ANC and other parties took elements of the struggle for majority rule and ran with them as the world moved on.",
                "First, it needs to be made very clear:\n\n'Boer' does **not** mean 'white people' in South Africa.  *Afrikaner* means white people in South Africa. The vast majority of people of Boer descent do not call themselves that in 2023, but instead call themselves Afrikaner. The only people who call themselves 'Boer' in 2023 are racist buttwipes who still pine for the days of Apartheid and want to start a white-exclusive *Volkstaat*. They also tend to be the people who own 80% of the farmland in South Africa.\n\nAlso important to point out: the EFF is a multi-ethnic political party with Afrikaners and 'Indians' in their party, and have had them for years. There's a reason that the head of the spear in their logo is both black and white.\n\nWith all of that said: the EFF's biggest obstacle has always been Julius Malema himself; He's a fantastic organizer and a fine spokesman, but he makes far too many gaffes and seems incapable of not putting is foot in his mouth at least once per appearance.",

If there were a large population of white people living there who weren't treating the people like disposable resources, and they too were being lumped in with their enemies, then maybe I'd say tone down the racial animosity. But revolutionaries and revolutions themselves are products of their material environment. \n\nIf their movement gets crushed, you can guarantee that white men like Joe Biden or Blinkin, or Macron, or the Board of Governors of the IMF, etc. would be ultimately backing whoever crushes it.",

                "I lived in South Africa for three years and my impression from that time is that while WASP is probably more accurate in terms of analysis, the EFF is much more effective and probably the best option out of South Africa's main three parties. The Democratic Alliance (DA) is filled with neoliberals and racists, while the ruling African National Congress (ANC) has pretty much abandoned any semblance of socialist ambitions. Same goes for the South African Communist Party (SACP), which currently exists only as an appendage to the ANC. \n\nThe EFF is complicated, because they do genuinely have some good ideas, but they also have significant problems attached. Their solutions are often simplistic and their understanding of Marxism is rudimentary at best. They are fairly consistent in their Pan-Africanism and anti-colonial rhetoric, though their anti-imperialism often overlooks (or actively embraces) the influences of Russia and China and sees only that of the West. This is understandable, but still an error in judgement. They also generally support the rights of LGBT people and immigrants, though in practice they may adjust that position somewaht when it's convenient for them. The most accurate description of them is probably that they're a populist party, with a lot of their strength coming from their charismatic leader Julius Malema.\n\nMalema was kicked out of the ANC after a series of disagreement with party leadership, which included his singing of the song \"Kill The Boer\". That song is a struggle song, which is not a call to murdering white people, but to destroy the system of white supremacy.  Malema then founded the EFF, and ever since, it has been in large part a personal project of his to preserve his political power. However, it also now has a base that works independently of Malema, so it could still be a vehicle for change. Also, even despite all the problems of the EFF, Malema could probably do a better job of ruling South Africa than the ANC currently does.\n\nUltimately, the party is not truly Marxist at heart, but it doesn't seem like that has to always be the case. With the right people inside the party and political education programs, the EFF might be able to become a revolutionary party. And even in its current state, it's most likely a preferable alternative to the ANC or DA.",

                "The EFF is not perfect, but it's the best option for a left wing movement in SA currently. Keyboard warriors like to complain that they talk too much about race, a sentiment that is obviously ridiculous when you consider that SA is a colonial society, 70% of the land is held by the white minority, ANC is a capitulationist party that failed to bring about nationalisation. Truth is, the interests of your average white Afrikaner worker is not the same as the black working class youth from which EFF draws the bulk of it's support from.\n\nIt is in the interest of white Afrikaners to uphold Apartheid's legacy (hence why they throw their support behind white supremacist parties such as DA and VF+). Racial struggle in SA is the same as class struggle, thus, it is important that we foster anti-whiteness and support groups who aren't afraid to fight white supremacy. At the end of the day, white workers in SA are no friend of the black man. I've yet to meet a white SA who wasn't a racist nostalgic for Apartheid, most whites are still racists at heart in SA.\n\nThat said, I don't fully trust the EFF. They're simply too closely knit with certain shady elements such as Adriano Mazotti, they're still preferable to the DA, ANC, and SACP though. Personally, I think that the SRWP headed by NUMSA's Irvin Jim might be the way forward for the SA left. It's a shame that they seem to be inactive at the moment though. Outside of that, there's AZAPO, BLF, and WASP but both of these parties lack any real amount of support, unlike EFF which is the third largest party in the country.",
                "Commented elsewhere as well, but the term the EFF use is \"white monopoly capital\". By this, they refer to the fact that the majority of wealth in South Africa is held by the rich white minority. This is a colonial continuity which they want to get rid off, through the methods of nationalizing industries and expropriating white farm owners (\"Boers\") without compensation. Parts of the EFF do have nativist tendencies and would like to see a sort of \"Africa for Africans\", and in this they often do not accept Whites, Indians or Coloured People. However, this is not necessarily a dominant part of the EFFs beliefs. White monopoly capital is very much the problem to them, it's just that the term doesn't mean the same for everyone. As for class struggle, the party certainly sees a need for it, it's just not clear how exactly that struggle should go and what its aim should be. As of now, the EFF has only existed for 10 years, and they are not completely opposed to the bourgeois state or to the existence of small and mid-sized business. However, the party is constantly developing, last I heard they started Marx reading groups in about 2019/20, so their understanding of Marxism may be improving and it's possible this could lead to changes in their policies.",

Plus, she wrote, \u201cmanufacturing construction has shown broad strength.\u201d\n\nAs a result Morgan Stanley now projects 1.9% economic expansion in the first half of this year. That\u2019s nearly four times the bank\u2019s previous 0.5% forecast for growth in gross domestic product in the first half of 2023.",

As Europe and East Asia slump into the economic drag of too many elderly and not enough young people over the next 10 years, Bidenomics is positioning the US to capitalize on its relative glut of labor. That means more high paying jobs for US citizens. This is smart economic policy, and the fact that he prioritized this policy when he did over making more flashy political scores says to me he\u2019s serious about advancing American interests in a way no president has been for decades.\n\nI think Biden\u2019s been shockingly effective, and has far exceeded my expectations. Certainly enough to earn my vote.",

That's what we'd have without public jobs.  \n\nNow could we all eat mushrooms and devise a better plan that involved UBI instead of make-work jobs?  Sure.  But I'm not holding my breath.

He didn't do any of that though and has had great foreign policy that has been encircling the geopolitical enemies of the US, with proper use of soft power. I will definitely be voting for him again this term, unless maybe Mitt Romney ran, who I also think is a pretty competent candidate.",

Inflation, including food and fuel, is over 20% on average.\n\nOne cannot infuse the economy with trillions in deficit spending without driving up inflation. If one trusts the self-congratulatory statistics and statements of this \"Administration\" everything sounds lovely. Unfortunately that does not square with our day-to-day experience of reality.\n\nSomeday we will look back, once the statistics have been \"corrected\" and realize that the recession of our economy is already well under way, and that the Fed, in collusion with the Administration, have done much more damage than good.\n\nEnergy policy lit the match, and deficit spending have kept the flame of currency devaluation, and inflation taxation, burning brightly.",

This means they have a specific window of opportunity they will never have again.  China has between now and 8 years until their economy/GDP will stagnate.  Russia saw this years ago for themselves and decided now or never is the best time to try to retake old Soviet territory.  It's all about population which contributes to GDP which contributes to competing with the West to stand a chance as a top super power or they will forever be 2nd tier.  This window of opportunity will pass for China and Russia, and is causing their foreign policy to be more aggressive as it really is now or never.

Everything submitted online goes through algorithms and so keywords and your document being scanned correctly are always most important, but on some level a human may eventually look at it and anything you can do to grab people skimming is important. Also better formatting could let juicy parts about you pop out better.\n\nYour accomplishments on the 1 year project sound great really above and beyond even other programmers I've seen with more experience (again, designer here).

After a while I registered on Linkedin and I never looked back. On linkedin I get job related messages at least once every week. Back when I was a junior, I still got messages but much more rarely than now, but still. \n\nI suggest the following for anyone who is struggling to get a job in the industry: have a decently filled linkedin profile and make sure you've selected that you're open for work. This makes so that your profile appears for hiring teams much quicker and you'll get dm's in no time IF and ONLY IF, you have a portfolio showing off some stuff. Doesn't have to be anything fancy, just some things, that show off your skills. Since you've been working in UE4 and with rendering pipelines, I highly recommend you to make a portfolio. If you can show off \"visual\" stuff like ue4 scenes or footage of code running in-engine or stuff like that, I would strongly suggest using artstation. I have my portfolio there too. If you have only code portfolio, then it's a bit harder, but still you can make code visually appealing too, just needs a bit of effort.\n\nGood luck!",

In graphic design, this is called *coding your content in colors* and it's an extreme oversight in many fields.\n\nNow, some people might argue that colors has no meaning on a resume, but that's because they don't know much about the impact of colors on short term and long term memories and might not have noticed themselves. A single bit of color in the texts on a resume will make it stand out from any other resume that are in black and white in the memory of any HR who don't have issues seeing colors.\n\nAs you show a personal website on your resume, I would suggest selecting 1 or 2 colors from your website's design and implement that color lightly in the resume.\n\nFor example, it could be the headers (SUMMARY, WORK EXPERIENCE, PROJECTS, etc.) in 1 color and the line under them being in another lighter color. The web links could also be in those colors.\n\nThe mindset behind why, originally, colors weren't much of a good thing on a resume was because they were exchanged through FAX machines, hence the color were often turned into pixelated (62dpi) gray ugly spots. There are also the cases where people would put too much colors or not the right color (making it hard to read) or making it unprintable (like if the resume is white text on a dark/colored background.

                "It\u2019s ridiculous they would charge more than $75 in the first place. If a 20% profit margin was acceptable, that would mean $60 in costs. \n\nCompare to electric utilities which use:\n- higher grade cabling - lots of expensive copper in those transmission lines compared to the cost of fiber optic cabling or cable\n- transformers every block and substation adding hundreds of thousands in equipment costs (let alone maintenance). Some of this equipment costs in the order of $10k. Other costs as much as half a million. Lightning, windstorms, etc. can all damage this pricy equipment. And electric companies are required to trim trees and such that might damage power lines - on the same poles ISPs use - which costs money every year. In contrast, (I will admit I don\u2019t know too much about internet routing but I did some googling), renting 40Gbps routing equipment will cost $2,400 a month; depending on load profiles, that\u2019s 1,600 customers streaming 4K Netflix at once (which consumes about 25 Mbps) if you assumed everyone streams at the exact same times of day - if you planned for 80% usage at peak hours, that\u2019s 2000 customers or $1.2 per customer. They probably need signal amplifiers if using copper-based cabling and have to maintain their cheaper-than-electric power cabling too. The math is obviously different for gigabit connections, but still nowhere close to $60 in costs. \n\nElectric has a connection fee of around $19 where I live (that\u2019s not counting consumption - just what they charge for you being on the grid). Using more power costs them more (more generation). Bandwidth, on the other hand, doesn\u2019t work the same. Once the equipment is installled, consuming more bandwidth doesn\u2019t cost much more.\n\nI\u2019d bargain that if the connection fee for electric is $19, given that electric utilities have to maintain trees near power lines and all that, that ISPs shouldn\u2019t charge more than $10-12 for a connection with a decent profit. If they also charged for usage at a reasonable profit margin, most users wouldn\u2019t pay more than $25.\n\nInternet is the USA is and has always been priced at ripoff costs and there\u2019s a reason they don\u2019t want to be regulated like a utility - it\u2019s money.",

To me, crying the collapse of the Russian economy is similar to Vatniks crying to the freezing of Europe last winter.\n\nShe has plenty of natural minerals for critical inputs for fighting, energy independent, arable land, and has her own independent academic and RDT&E sectors.  Hell, I\u2019d argue any upper middle income country would be able to adapt and survive being sanctioned even if she is partially lacking in the above four stipulations.  It even gets better for Russia in that she had already prepared for the possibility of western sanctions on numerous sectors and industries, and the Russian central bank response to the sanctions was good.  The only possibility of a Russian economic collapse being some revolution, which, I personally, consider unlikely.\n\nThis isn\u2019t to say sanctions, or the past three decades, haven\u2019t hurt the Russian economy, be it growth potential or the average Russian.  The Russian economy as a whole, has been unlucky the past half a century, and I wouldn\u2019t want to be a Russian economist, let\u2019s put it that way.  From the stagnation in the 70s-80s; failed shock-therapy in the 90s; honestly pretty good 2000s; and a 2010s and likely 2020s that we all know how crap they were.  Many Russian measures to fight the recession and wartime spending will have longterm consequences, and the rising costs of many western goods hurt everyone.\n\nI could go further, but I\u2019m just going to quote another economist on YouTube named [Perun](https://youtu.be/Q9w17Ne1S0M).",

Debt is not exclusive to currency, after all.\n\nBut the moment you start trading with other groups, outside what is more or less your family, that's when formal bartering comes up. That said, once cities cropped up in ancient mesopotamia, currency was used around the same time proto cuneiform writing systems were in use. So barter clearly isn't a very effective economic system outside small farming villages trading locally with other villages. Surely it was still used at times, but currency only became more common from there.\n\nTo summarize, debt doesn't invalidate barter, it just invalidates the opinions of ignorant people.

When some non neoclassical economists suggest introducing policy that adds local rules to encourage equilibrium, those very same economists then deride it, because it results in a lesser optimum, while claiming it has no benefits. They genuinely believe that equilibrium comes at no cost, so any costs to achieve equilibrium are a waste and actually stand in the way of further optimization. The amount of neoclassical economists that pretend there is an equilibrium, then suggest policies that discourage equilibrium in practice, is quite shocking.\n\nNeoclassicals rely on equilibrium conditions to prove the absence of exploitation aka to make \"capitalism look perfect\", then never bother to actually achieve it, as if it will all happen automatically, as if these things were some law of physics, when economies are purely man made and equilibrium conditions have to be part of the design of the economy. What's even more disgusting is that the moment you actually talk about physics and the real world, economists will then turn around and bend the laws as if the fabric of reality was man-made.

                "Article:\n\nBERLIN \u2014 Germany\u2019s biggest companies are ditching the fatherland.    \n\nChemical giant BASF has been a pillar of German business for more than 150 years, underpinning the country\u2019s industrial rise with a steady stream of innovation that helped make \u201cMade in Germany\u201d the envy of the world.   \n\nBut its latest moonshot \u2014 a $10 billion investment in a state-of-the-art complex the company claims will be the gold standard for sustainable production \u2014 isn\u2019t going up in Germany. Instead, it\u2019s being erected 9,000 kilometers away in China.  \n\nEven as it chases the future in Asia, BASF, founded on the banks of the Rhine in 1865 as the Badische Anilin- & Sodafabrik, is scaling back in Germany. In February, the company announced the shutdown of a fertilizer plant in its hometown of Ludwigshafen and other facilities, which led to about 2,600 job cuts. \n\n\u201cWe are increasingly worried about our home market,\u201d BASF Chief Executive Martin Bruderm\u00fcller told shareholders in April, noting that the company lost \u20ac130 million in Germany last year. \u201cProfitability is no longer anywhere near where it should be.\u201d  \n\nSuch malaise now pervades the whole of the German economy, which slipped into a recession in the first quarter amid a flurry of surveys showing that both companies and consumers are deeply skeptical about the future.  \n\nThat concern is well founded. Nearly 20 years ago, Germany overcame its reputation as the \u201csick man of Europe\u201d with a package of ambitious labor market reforms that unshackled its industrial potential and ushered in a sustained period of prosperity, driven in particular by strong demand for its machinery and cars from China. While Germany frustrated many partners by exporting vastly more than it was buying, its economy flourished.\n\nThe boom times, however, came with a cost: The economic strength lulled its leaders into a false sense of security. Their failure to pursue further reforms is now coming back to bite. \n\nSuddenly, a perfect storm is brewing over the former European powerhouse, signaling that its current recession isn\u2019t just \u201ctechnical,\u201d as policymakers pray, but rather a harbinger of a fundamental reversal in economic fortunes that threatens to send tremors across Europe, injecting even more upheaval into the Continent\u2019s already polarized political landscape.  \n\nConfronted by a toxic cocktail of high energy costs, worker shortages and reams of red tape, many of Germany\u2019s biggest companies \u2014 from giants like Volkswagen and Siemens to a host of lesser-known, smaller ones \u2014 are experiencing a rude awakening and scrambling for greener pastures in North America and Asia. \n\nAbsent an unexpected turnaround, it\u2019s hard to avoid the conclusion that Germany is headed for a much deeper economic decline. \n\nThe reports from the front lines are only getting worse. Unemployment rose year-on-year by about 200,000 in June, a month when companies normally add jobs. Though the overall unemployment rate remains low at 5.7 percent and the number of job vacancies high at nearly 800,000, German officials are bracing for more bad news.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re beginning to feel the difficult economic conditions in the labor market,\u201d German labor office head Andrea Nahles said. \u201cUnemployment is rising and employment growth is losing momentum.\u201d",

Yes, there is a lot of bullshit, and I became deeply disillusioned with the whiteboard cartoons that constitute a typical education in neoclassical economics like the one I underwent. There is a lot of interesting and valuable stuff, as well--it can be useful to make an explicit framework, even if it's flawed, because at least that gives you something that you can test and iterate on, and you can build a language to talk about complex economic systems, and map out where your model does and does not make accurate predictions.\n\nThere is a lot of really goddamn good work that falls under \"economics\" (and econometrics). Galbraith, Stiglitz, Veblen, and more--some damn good stuff there and I'm grateful for their contributions to my mental model for how the world works.\n\nBut there is so much money and power at stake and so goddamned much of mainstream economics is dedicated to serving the elite ownership class, even when the data has to be cherry-picked and twisted for the purpose. This supporting relationship can be subtle, like the sleight of hand that happens when \"GDP growth\" or \"stock market growth\" masquerade as \"economic growth;\" and it can be less subtle, like when pundit or president gets in front of a camera and says that poisoning the land and exploiting each other is by definition the only possible route to \"prosperity.\"\n\nMuch of mainstream economic thought (and great big swaths of heterodox economics!) is little more than a corrupted servant of the politics of domination, and yet it is also under the umbrella of economics that some of the greatest and most incisive champions of human flourishing have labored. It's a mixed bag.\n\nIf I had one book to recommend it'd be The Dawn of Everything by Graeber and Wengrow.\n\nI don't really listen to any econ-focused podcasts but there was a Behind the Bastards recently on Jack Welch [https://www.iheart.com/podcast/105-behind-the-bastards-29236323/episode/part-one-jack-welch-is-why-114741686/](https://www.iheart.com/podcast/105-behind-the-bastards-29236323/episode/part-one-jack-welch-is-why-114741686/) that is an entertaining case study on how one particular shitty guy did a lot of damage while being celebrated and enabled by \"mainstream economics.\"",

                "Free market macroeconomics has like 4 graphs that matter. The rest is (in my opinion) either an argument about channels or fluff to get clicks/obfuscate from what's worthwhile. And if it's in media, probably fluff. \n\nThe 4 graphs are: \n\n1. [Production Possibilities Frontier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Production%E2%80%93possibility_frontier), PPF (you will never see this in a headline, but it's like the first week of any econ class)\n2. [Aggregate Supply and Demand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AD%E2%80%93AS_model) (this is where GDP and inflation live in economic theory, probably the most important thing in a 101 textbook, and is also Keynesian as fuck)\n3. [Money Market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_supply) (also a supply/demand graph, but supply is heavily influenced by the federal bank--this is how interest rates are set)\n4. [Phillips Curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phillips_curve) (shows a relationship between inflation and unemployment, was invented in the 50s and 60s and then \\~modified\\~ in the 70s by Milton Friedman and others because the old model couldn't explain stagflation)\n\nAll of these (except the PPF) are underpinned with free market assumptions, some of which are benign, while others are capitalistic out their problematic asses. All of them have some level of empirical backing (although the history of the Phillips Curve should remind everyone that modern economics was really only invented a generation or two ago (GDP only became the go-to metric after WWII and technically the US used GNP from 1934 all the way up until 1991)) and all of them have some predictive power (because they were invented to describe the economy they exist in, so no shit.)\n\nThe reason central banks can wield so much control over ThE eCoNomY with just one knob is because the interest rate is the price of money. How much does borrowing $100 cost? Well at 5.5% it costs $5.50. In the US, the fed's mandate established by Congress is 1. Full Employment (whatever that means) and 2. Stable Prices (they say 2% inflation is their goal). (And, since 2008, they've also kind of said that the overall health of the banking system is on their mind, which on the one hand yeah makes sense, but on the other those banks shouldn't exist after '08-09). You'll notice that the fed's dual mandate of employment vs inflation is also what's on the Phillips Curve. So that's a pretty important graph to Jerome Powell. \n\nWhen you talk about assumptions and generalizations, yeah. There's a lot of those. Some of them are very strong and simple and good (the Law of One Price on foreign exchange markets in the computer age). Some just make the math easier (demand curves are monotonic). Some are problematic (no externalities). \n\nI like economics. Studied it in university. \"The social science concerned with the allocation of scarce resources.\" What did I learn on the first day? Free markets efficiently allocate goods/services IF 6 criteria are fulfilled. The background/math behind showing this took up the first half of the semester. The second half was filled with \"what if the 6 criteria aren't filled\" (which, spoiler alert, is most of the time) and \"what if we don't want to prioritize efficiency\" which is an ethical question that economics alone will never be enough to answer. I've already written probably way to much, but if you want to talk more about this send me a dm--I'm more than happy to.",

Everyone that has gone food shopping can see that prices have not matched the government inflation statistics, it's closer to double or triple, but when you iphone only has a 5% mark up that looks alot better then 20-30% for food.\n\nSame is for employment demand, it's based of business job listings, even though they don't plan to hire for those positions.\n\nThe rabbit hole of the us flawed statistics figures is frightening and yet so many people base everything off of these flawed and misleading data sets.",

For the economics of Smith and Friedman to work a few truths need to be accepted as gospel. Some big ones are that people always act rationally, that people always have perfect information, that everyone always plays by the rules fast rly and equally and the market will always rebalance to a point where supply meets demand for a given price.  This particular economic paradigm also downplays what it calls negative externalities (a current negative externality is the increasingly negative effects of anthropogenic climate change - kind of a big one to downplay imho. \n\nNeoliberalism, as the dominant economic paradigm since the end of WWII at least is BS because it is not based on reality and how human being actually behave. \n\nOnly global revolution (or catastrophe) will likely be able to displace it.",

It's much more like psychology, were we know that X usually leads to Y, but sometimes it goes this other way, and occasionally just does something completely different, because there are an infinite number of variables we will never know about.\n\nSo we can identify stuff like the law of supply and demand, and we can predict that if the price of these two things goes up, the price for that other thing will go down.  But every so often, every sign and trend and historical precedent will show that X is clearly going to happen, but then the general public just says \"nah\", and it doesn't.\n\nAnd then there's the other part.  The real problem part.\n\nBecause \"economics\" doesn't just refer to the scientific study of *how money moves*, but it's also about the *philosophy* of how we distribute resources.\n\nAnd this- THIS- gets into some really thorny shit, because we can start with a moral presumption: That growth is inherently good, or that workers deserve to control the means of production, or that a free market is fair and equitable, or that a particular resource inherently belongs to X,Y, or Z- and then you can find ALL KINDS of scientific data that supports you, because of all of that data is at best a probability and at worst anecdotal, and will happily fit whatever narrative you want it to.\n\nBasically, it's philosophers pretending to be statisticians.

Running train routes generates income to the companies that can then be paid to shareholders as dividends or retained in the company to manage cashflow and capital requirements to make sure your trains don't rust. You can then in later rounds sell stock in companies impacting the price of the company's stock in the stock market. More complicated games in the genre have things like short selling stock, partial capitalization and merges and acquisitions.\n\nOnly complaint is that similar to running a real business the games are very number heavy and can feel like you need to breakout a spreadsheet to make the best decisions.",

Patients are basically on a list up for grabs. Some pay better than others for your services.\n\nYou can't have it all when there are effectively only 18 turns for the entire game, but the amount you can do for any of the turns is limited to your resources:\n-Your money limits how much you can spend for building.\n-Your \"queue points\" limits how many patients you can admit each turn. I think of this as: \"How many lines can I open to serve customers = how many I can bring to my clinic versus other players\"\n\nConsiderably a light game for a heavy game, according to some.

                "FDR was probably the best president in terms of long-lasting domestic economic impact, I think GDP growth was also rather large under FDR but GDP is a flawed metric for various reasons. All the infrastructure built in the new deal (both the physical infrastructure and the human infrastructure such as investment in arts, science and education) had a long-lasting positive economic impact for the rest of the 20th century and even now some infrastructure from that era is still used. \n\nGI's came home from WWII with roads, hospitals, dams, bridges, and parks built over the past 12ish years. There were also helpful programs like Social Security that helped create some sort of social safety net. In addition, there were the short-term depression programs that gave people a lot of jobs and relief when it was most greatly needed.   \nAlthough I think FDR did shortchange African Americans from the New Deal and didn't push for more economic safety nets when he was in better health ( I think his economic bill of rights came very late in his presidency) he still laid the groundwork for the economy in many positive ways that I don't think any president had or has since. I think too many times people think of the economy as GDP, unemployment and stock market numbers along with a few other metrics. While things like life expectancy, infrastructure, quality of life, environmental health, real wages adjusted for purchasing power and inflation, worker rights and benefits and other factors go largely ignored.   \nFDR had a large positive impact on a lot of areas both traditional metrics and lesser used metrics.",

                "Oh no, time to rethink our entire economy. Can't have investment properties losing value. \n\n\n*Insert eye roll here*",
                "The relevant information from this subscription piece (part of Scott Barlow's weekday Top Links missives):\n\nBMO economist Robert Kavcic describes why it makes no sense to buy an income property in the current environment,\r  \n\r  \n\u201cInvestors are almost completely absent from the Canadian housing market, especially in Toronto (maybe not so in Calgary). No surprise there, because the economics just don\u2019t make any sense right now. Consider that a new income property investor would be deeply cash-flow negative with 20% down at current prices and mortgage rates. While this was the case to a lesser extent before the tightening cycle as well, it was mitigated by the fact that ultra-low rates allowed a building of equity below the surface. Now, investors are largely cash-flow negative even on the interest portion of their payments. Unless, prices are rising at a brisk pace, which they are not (let alone falling), the case for investment doesn\u2019t exist at this time. And there\u2019s another thing: Investors can pick up better yield in dividend stocks/gov\u2019t bonds, with better tax treatment/no risk, instant liquidity, and no trouble with the Landlord and Tenant Board. One implication is that new supply is stalling, because investors typically help pre-sell new developments and bring them to the construction phase.\u201d\n\n\\-RZ",
                "I have no sympathy for investors who snap up properties just to turn around and make someone else pay their mortgage. Down-payments are a serious barrier to housing for people, and the fact that investors can afford to pay more helps solidify the wealth and class divide in our housing market.\n\nThe concerning piece of this is that many new developments are financed by so called mom and pop landlords. A lot of people put down the money for pre-construction that helps get projects out of the ground, even if they're only doing it to flip. That's a bad feature of our housing market, but it was still an avenue to get housing built faster. If we're losing pre-construction investors, it's another nail in the coffin to our already lackluster performance on housing starts. The wide between housing starts and population growth will be exacerbated.",
                "Probably not a comment people here like to hear, the next few years can be one of those once in a 25 years opportunity to buy real estate, especially if you have the cash.",
                "I\u2019ve been wondering when the music would stop for investment properties. Feels like it\u2019s been a decade of dancing. Inflation and sticky high housing prices are making things tougher and I imagine we need another year or so to see how that influences the market fully.",
                "It\u2019s not a good investment today \u2014 as in right now \u2014 because rates are high and mortgage rules make it a liquidity issue. This being said, the US fed is expected to start lowering rates early 2024 and this time next year it\u2019ll become a good long term investment.\n\nShit, I would go as far as to say if you have the means now it\u2019s a good long term investment for family planning similar to education RIFs. Your kids will need housing, you can put them on the deed, and they can own the equity when they are older or move in. \n\nA 20 year investment in their housing today will put them well ahead once it\u2019s time for them to move out. At minimum they live in the property for a year and sell it with no capital gains/income taxes as their name is on the deed and it\u2019s their primary residence. 100% tax free return on investment."

It\u2019s sole \u201cexport\u201d is administration and everything surrounding is devoted either to the practical or ceremonial function of government. (And the luxury for the elites) \n\nHere\u2019s a quote from like the first page of the foundation (I think it aptly describes some aspects of terra)\n\n> As the centre of the Imperial Government for unbroken hundreds of generations and located, as it was, in the central regions of the Galaxy among the most densely populated and industrially advanced worlds of the system, it could scarcely help being the densest and richest clot of humanity the Race had ever seen. Its urbanization, progressing steadily, had finally reached the ultimate. All the land surface of Trantor, 75,000,000 square miles in extent, was a single city. The population, at its height, was well in excess of forty billions. This enormous population was devoted almost entirely to the administrative necessities of Empire, and found themselves to be few for the complications of the task. (It is to be remembered that the impossibility of proper administration of the Galactic Empire under the uninspired leadership of the later Emperors was a considerable factor in the Fall.) Daily, fleets of ships in the tens of thousands brought the produce of twenty agricultural worlds to the dinner tables of Trantor...Its dependence upon the outer worlds for food, and indeed, for all necessities of life, made Trantor increasingly vulnerable to conquest by siege. In the last millennium of the Empire, the monotonously numerous policy made Emperor after Emperor conscious of this, and Imperial policy became little more than the protection of Trantor's delicate jugular vein.",

But if you look for housing prices in small towns in the Midwest you can rent a two-story family house for 1/3rd of that price?\n\nTerra is like that but on a galactic scale. The price of one square meter in Terra is worth costs about the same as an entire palace on an average Hive World. \n\n>\u2018Land on Terra is the most expensive in the Imperium. For the price of one square metre of any of\nthis, you could buy a palace on a Hive World, or on most worlds of the Imperium if truth be told.\u2019\n\n>\u2018The sacred soil of Terra,\u2019 said Ragnar.\n\n>\u2018The sacred and very expensive soil of Terra, Brother Ragnar. Thousands of lives have been lost\nfor areas the size of a small farm on one of the islands on Fenris.\u2019\n\n> - Space Wolves: Wolfblade\n\nSimilarly, from a more recent source. A bowl of fresh berries on Terra costs as much as a Hive Spire on a lesser world.\n\n>What is important? I do not know any more. My belly was full, as it was so often then. I was dining well from a table set with silver platters. All of it was real \u2013 fruits conveyed from the farthest reaches of the Segmentum in cryo-tanks. I felt the tight berries burst in my mouth as I chewed. One of those alone would have bought a hive spire on a lesser world, but we were on Terra, at the top of the pyramid, and barely gave it a thought.\n\n> - Watchers of the Throne: The Emperor's Legion\n\nEven people who have high-ranking and relatively important jobs in the Adeptus Terra live in terrible conditions, barely affording cramped one-room apartments for themselves and having to survive on nutrient rations and recycled artificial water.\n\nTake for example Journeymaster Agister Holbech. He is responsible for the safe berthing of hundreds of cargo-hauler ships that make landfall on Terra every single day. In the Triad Port Watchtowers where he is stationed on, a large lifter ship lands on a platform every twenty seconds, and there are sixteen different platforms. A veritable army of workers is required to keep the operation running twenty-four hours a day, and just as many scribes are needed to catalogue all of the transports.\n\nAnd yet, let's take a look at his living space:\n\n>Holbech lurched inside, throwing the day\u2019s tally scrolls onto a low sideboard. Dirty windows on the far wall offered a privileged vista of the nightscape outside \u2013 a landscape of jagged spikes, studded with lurid points of light from hab lumens, search-beams, furnace plumes and the glowing swarms of air traffic, all set against the stained churn of the ever-moving thunderheads. The air was hot, humid, like the break point before a storm, except that those clouds never broke \u2013 they just boiled and shifted, hemming in the heat, wreathing the world below in a gasping clutch of desiccation.\n\n>He was sweating, and he poured himself a long drink \u2013 refiltered water, laced with pure alcohol, flavoured with synthetic cardamom. Then he went over to a long couch, the leather real but patched, the steel frame speckled with rust. As he sank down onto it the joints squealed and the coils sagged.\n\n>He looked over his apartment, high up on the spire\u2019s western flank. It was a privileged position by most standards, but not as high as he\u2019d have liked; not up into the opulent levels where the air was scraped through filters to excise the grit and the floors were cooled and there were living plants \u2013 living plants! \u2013 watered from cisterns that the parched multitudes below could have survived off for a year.\n\n>To Holbech\u2019s mind he hadn\u2019t quite achieved his potential \u2013 it was a thought that occupied his mind every night after a long shift, as he remembered his performance in the distant guild examinations or recalled the time he\u2019d imagined himself competing for a seat on the Schedulists councils, or the wardenship of a major traffic node, or \u2013 and why should he not have dreamt of it? \u2013 the speakership itself.\n\n>Holbech took a long draught of his semi-palatable cocktail, and looked out miserably across the little realm he had been able to secure for himself. The stipend for a journeymaster was substantial by objective standards, for he was responsible for the safe berthing of hundreds of cargo-haulers every day, and yet still his hab-space was no more than ten square metres, two-thirds of the way up the decent zones of a middling spire complex on the edge of the mundane Salvator zone. He looked with regret at the things he had collected \u2013 the cheap vases, the parchment records of obsolete vessel-types stacked in bundles, the chairs, the tables, the broken vid-relayer with its data sets of Missionaria improvement sessions.\n\n> - Vaults of Terra: The Carrion Throne\n\nOn a lesser world, Journeymaster Agister Holbech would have been a minor planetary noble, enjoying a life of privileged comfort and luxury on a mansion somewhere, attended by servants, wearing the finest fashion and eating refined cuisine...

                "Article:\n\n**The 20-somethings face a toxic cocktail of exorbitant housing costs, weakening job prospects and a heavy load of student debt.**\n\nSticky inflation, rising bills and the fastest set of interest rate hikes in a generation have plunged the UK into a deep cost-of-living crisis. For Britain\u2019s youngest workers, the pain stretches deeper; the country\u2019s adult Zoomers, now in the first half of their twenties, face a toxic cocktail of exorbitant housing costs, weakening job prospects and a heavy load of student debt.\n\nTogether the headwinds threaten to choke not just their ability to progress economically, but also the future prosperity of a country that desperately needs to fill jobs. Anemic growth means there\u2019s no immediate end in sight.\n\nRecent economic data suggests that there\u2019s little reason to be optimistic that living standards are set to improve either; productivity growth has stalled and workers are suffering from long-term health issues. The government is also facing public sector workers striking about their pay, many of whom are threatening to leave for better prospects; one in three NHS junior doctors said they planned to move abroad for better pay and working conditions, according to a poll carried out late last year by the British Medical Association, a trade union body.\n\n\u201cWithout productivity growth, we\u2019re not going to see the real wage growth or the kind of improvement in living standards that younger generations previously expected over their lifetime,\u201d said Sophie Hale, principal economist at the Resolution Foundation, an economic think tank.\n\n\u201cHigh inequality in the UK is causing issues for younger generations, but it\u2019s particularly for lower- and middle-income households where that combination of high inequality and and really slow growth is a particularly toxic combination,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019ve seen this really big decline in relative living standards over the past of decade and a half.\u201d\nHere\u2019s a snapshot of what life is life for Britain\u2019s young:\n\n**Wage Growth for Graduate Jobs Fell Just as Inflation Rose**\n\nWhile the UK has so far managed to avoid a recession, alarm bells are ringing. The Bloomberg Reed Jobs Report shows that job postings are down almost a quarter in the three months to June from a year earlier, an indicator that a possible downturn that could lead to layoffs may be on the horizon.\n\nA university education, long heralded as an earnings booster, is also no longer enough to help boost pay. Analysis of advertised graduate roles on Reed Recruitment shows that the average salary growth began to slump just as price rises picked up pace, leading to real-term cuts for these workers. Meanwhile, both Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey have called for wage restraint to avoid fueling inflation.\n\nAt the same time, the country\u2019s tax burden is the highest since the end of the Second World War, and more workers are being dragged into paying more to the Treasury as thresholds stay frozen. Put together, disposable income per head has fallen for British households in five of the last six quarters. While older workers may be able to fall back on savings, the same isn\u2019t true for recent graduates. That also helps to explain why 10.4% of newly enrolled employees are opting out of making pension contributions, according to the most recent data from last August.",
                "This isn\u2019t unique to Britain. This is happening all over Europe. I know Reddit hates the US but the opportunities are really endless here.\n\nCompare that to something like Spain, who has 32% youth unemployment, it\u2019s kinda scary to be a young person in some European countries.",
                "There seems to be a disconnect in economic fundamentals. Jobs need to be filled and wages are going down are inherently contradictory. This means that there is some sort of government policy, tax, regulation, or lack of proper enforcement that is forcing economic activity to divert from normalcy. \n\nBrexit caused all sorts of issues and continues to do so. They need to be careful that brain drain doesn\u2019t occur because that can be a vicious cycle. \n\nThey have been investing heavily in renewables and once that slows down and the benefits of those investments come to fruition, things may improve. I would not bet on one progressive investment to save the country. The war in Ukraine isn\u2019t helping (increased energy costs and increased military spending/donations)",

That the rate of longterm illness is doubling is extremely concerning. What is causing things like the youth cancer rate to go up?",

Choices might seem free, but the outcome can be predetermined by powerful forces, leaving us with limited options. The game is set\u2026we play their moves, thinking we have a choice, but the result has been rigged by those in control.\n\nEfforts to deceive the public into thinking they're free and prosperous have grown, limiting freedom and upward mobility. In 2023, once prosperous nations\u2019s Ponzi schemes are evident\u2026quality of life declines, wages stagnate, and life expectancy worsens. The illusion is shattering.\n\nWe're on a sinking ship, the rich secure above, while the rest bear the rising water below. The rich increasingly went higher on the ship seeking safety, and taking resources with them while the middle class and the poor have been sitting at the bottom of the boat, bearing the brunt of the water inching slowly higher and higher toward our heads. Are we to stay on the boat and die, while the rest take the lifeboats, or do we try to take our place at the top with the rich? It\u2019s harder to do when the water rises, isn\u2019t it? You were disadvantaged before but now You can\u2019t move as freely and it\u2019s that much more impossible. Or do we swim to a porthole, open a window and swim to safety. See, America used to be that shining beacon of hope, because the water level was low enough. So people fled their own boats for ours. But that only increased the weight of the ship, sinking it further, while the richest at the top ate all the food and kept the poor alive just enough to help take the buckets and shovel some of the water out. It used to be, if you shoveled enough water, someone would say, good job, come on up a bit higher out of the water. But the hole just got too big. And they knew it before you did. They bash other boats for being bad, but most of you don\u2019t even know what those boats are all about. But as for me, I am a water shoveler. And I am done. I\u2019m getting off the boat. \n\nAnd this is all not to say there isn\u2019t a place for a \u201cgo get \u2018em\u201d mindset. Work hard, be a valuable person, gain skills and achieve. Have a positive mindset and try, yes! I agree. But at what cost, in this environment. For me, it\u2019s time to bring my positive mindset to a playing field worth participating."

Their language is English, so they spread it to their territories. \n\nOverall, English is the most spoken language in the world, and it's not really a contest.

                "No. For a variety of reasons. Primarily because English by comparison is a pretty easy language to learn. It's rather straightforward, it has little to no complicated grammar, and a vocabulary that borrows heavily from different kinds of languages and language groups, which makes it feel more familiar to non-English speakers. \n\nIn addition to that, because of the fact that the British Empire at their largest extent controlled about a quarter (!) of the world, it made sense for English to be the de facto language of the world. For better or worse, they (meaning English speakers, so the USA included) also pioneered in (information) technology and in recent decades lead the information revolution with script languages used all around the world. \n\nFinally, and I think this is a significant factor as well, the Chinese don't have a superiority complex that the English had, in the sense that they'd want to \"rid the world of barbarity and bring civilization\". Chinese people are more than content to stick to their part of the world, without feeling the need to subject everyone else to their language or culture.",

It takes years to learn enough non-phonetic characters to understand things like news articles in Chinese - even for Chinese kids living in China. \n\nYou can\u2019t look at a sign in Chinese and sound it out phonetically and look it up.

            "selftext": "The US Supreme Court case *American Ship Building Company v National Labor Relations Board* demonstrates how capitalists manipulate anti-democratic governmental authority (such as the court) to thwart democratic policies that were put in place to help give labor better bargaining power. \n\nhttps://www.fivefourpod.com/episodes/american-ship-building-company-v-national-labor-relations-board/\n\nThe case was in 1965 and, basically, centers on the fact that the company performed a lock-out - they shut down the company and laid off the workers, pre-empting a pending strike in order to gain advantages in negotiating wages and conditions with workers upon re-hiring - and the NLRB said that this was an unfair labor practice under the NLRA of 1935 because it specifically undermines the workers' right to strike and/or collectively bargain. The case held that the lock out did not undermine workers' rights to strike or collectively bargain, despite the fact that there is literally no possible way a rational person could come to that conclusion, because that's exactly what a lock out is for. \n\nImportantly, the act was created because of an understanding that employers are simply in a more powerful position for negotiating, and protecting workers' rights to collectively bargain including striking helps them to negotiate more fairly. Employers love negotiating with workers individually; they have far more resources at their disposal, including legal counsel, money and control of the capital in question.  Any one worker leaving or walking away creates very little difficulty for an employer, while not having a job can create huge financial difficulty for a worker and their family. This was just understood by Congress in the period following the Guilded Age, and it's why the NLRA was passed.\n\nLock-outs are argued (by those who support private capital interests) to be the employers' version of a strike and thus equivalent and fair; this completely misses the entire point of the NLRA and it dismisses the reality that workers and employers simply don't have equal footing for negotiations; protecting a company's desire to perform lock-outs literally and directly undermines workers' ability to strike and collectively bargain, there's just no way to understand this honestly any differently.\n\nThe court's opinion tried to create this distinction between lock-outs due to anti-labor sentiments and simply protecting their economic interests, which is just a bullshit, not-real distinction. Employers hate unions because of the economic reasons, you can't separate this.\n\n##Violence to Protect Capital Led to the NLRA\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homestead_strike\n\nThere are plenty of examples of labor disputes resulting in violence. I'm choosing this one in major part, honestly, because it is also the one that the 5-4 podcast showcased, but there's the Battle of Blair Mountain, the Railroad Strike of 1877, etc etc. I won't recount every detail, but the  Homestead Strike also features a lock-out, which does help tie it to the *American Ship Builders* case.\n\nThe Homestead Strike demonstrated how capitalists resort to violence to protect their interests and that the government is overwhelmingly aligned with those capital interests.\n\nIn 1892, striking workers at a steel company, discovered that the company (owned by *the* Carnegie) was sending in the Pinkertons and scabs by barge in the night. The workers, along with their families, went out to meet the scabs and hired security, and violence broke out. The workers defeated the Pinkertons in that battle, but then the Governor of Pennsylvania (elected with support from Carnegie-backed political groups) sent in the militia to take the company back for the owners.\n\nThe fact that workers can be driven to a point that they are so desperate for better wages and conditions that they are willing to become violent and that capitalists respond to such threats with violence themselves demonstrates the intrinsic conflicts within capitalism. \n\nCapitalism is not \"freedom\" nor \"economic prosperity.\" It is a systematic separation of labor from the ownership of capital and the use of force to protect the claims of ownership made by private parties. The government has long protected these claims because, more often than not, the same kinds of people who have wealth have the connections and financial backing to win elections, and those with lots of wealth tend to support politicians who they believe will continue to uphold this system. \n\nSadly, even when labor gets some small protections like the NLRA of 1935, it gets rolled back with policy like the Taft-Harley Aft and Supreme Courts sympathetic to the individually wealthy.",

                "The story around the Homestead Strike is largely pro union myth. Years before the strike in 1892, there was another strike, in which strikers violently assaulted people and destroyed property, with the Sheriff of the county being unable to stop the rioting and violence. After this strike, Carnegie Steel reached a deal with workers in which they would be paid on a sliding scale based on the price of steel. If the price of steel increased, wages would increase, if the price of steel decreased, wages would decrease, but they could not decrease beyond a set amount agreed upon by the workers and management. Because of this deal, many workers where paid well above industry standards, even as the price of steel declined. The deal expired in 1892, the year of the strike. \n\nAfter this, the unions went on strike, occupying the Homestead plant and effectively setting up their own government within the plant, forbidding non union workers from entering the plant and \"arresting\" those who did not support the way in which the strike was carried out. Carnegie Steel arranged for 300 Pinkerton guards to come and retake the plant, which was under occupation. When the guards crossed the river on barges and reached the docks, they were attacked by a violent mob, which fired upon them with revolvers, rifles, and even a cannon. There were attempt to set the barges on fire, there were attempts to dynamite the barges with the Pinkertons on them. The Pinkerton's were forced to surrender, after which they were subject to beatings and harassment. Because of this violence and anarchy, the governor of Pennsylvania sent in the National Guard to end the situation.\n\nThe Homestead incident was essentially a violent occupation of company property, after which the company attempted to take its property back, which was met with violent resistance and warfare. The government stepped in to stop the violent anarchy that was occurring and to return the plant to its rightful owners. Months after this event, members of the \"Advisory Committee\", which ran the violent riot, bombed the housing of non union workers, others had their houses burnt down. Many non union workers were attacked and beaten when they were caught alone. Eventually the violence and the movement petered out.",

Ethiopia forms a trade bloc with allies and imposes tariffs on goods from outside Africa.\n\nEthiopia mediates African conflicts: Ethiopia's stable monarchy and prosperity give it moral authority to broker peace in African conflicts. It intervenes as a neutral mediator in places like Sudan, Somalia and the Congo. Ethiopian peacekeepers helps quell violence.\n\nCold War alignment: Ethiopia aligns strategically with the United States and West during the Cold War. It receives massive foreign investment and aid in exchange for hosting U.S. military bases and spy installations. Ethiopia acts as an American bulwark against Soviet influence in Africa. \n\nNew African identity: An economically powerful, stable Ethiopia serves as a model of African independence, unity and prosperity. Ethiopia promotes a pan-African identity that embraces Ethiopia's unique Christian heritage within an African narrative. Ethiopian cultural influence spreads across the continent.\n\nIn summary, an industrialized Ethiopia in the post-WW2 era could have transformed it into an economic powerhouse that reshaped East African development, mediated conflicts, aligned strategically with the West and promoted a new African identity centered on Ethiopian ideals. Ethiopia may have become \"the China of Africa.\"",
                "Ethiopia didn\u2019t expand not because it failed to industrialize, but because it had centralization issues. \n\nThe ebb and flow of the power of the emperor between absolute and feudal empire left it in a borderline renaissance equivalent society in the industrial era.",
                "My comment on someone's comment about Kenya. I elaborate my position further.\n\nVis-\u00e0-vis a relationship with Kenya, I think this would change a hell of a lot. Probably depends on the politics of Ethiopia. If industrialisation starts right after WWII, perhaps it would bring with it a form of even moderate militarism in reaction to their experiences at the hands of the Italians.\n\nDepending on how things go, they'd probably become major players in, for example, the Mau Mau Rebellion in Kenya. I can't see the Brits asking them for help in their colony, but I could imagine them either influencing a strong post-independence Kenyan government or kicking around a weak one. If the Kenyans are politically aligned, they'd have an easy time engaging with the Ethiopians positively and using their far superior (to the neighbourhood) infrastructure to keep up with the Ethiopians in macro terms and probably far surpass them in per capita metrics like standards of living, being an anti-communist bullwark in a region surrounded by left leaning Somalia and Tanzania, and a chaotic Congo, Rwanda, Yemen etc.\nEast Africa and the Western Indian Ocean (outside the Persian gulf) could devolve into a competition between Ethiopia and Kenya or a very interesting synergy.\n\nIf the Ethiopians aren't distracted by the Kenyans, they would be able to very lazily dominate the region the way South Africa does its own region, and they'd probably start experimenting with their influence on the Red Sea trade route. If they do it well, they could turn Djibouti and maybe Massawa into cities comparable to Singapore or Hong Kong and get a kick-ass economy running like that. If they do it poorly, they could perhaps find themselves drawing the wrong kind of attention and have an Ogaden Style war kicked off by countries that don't like their experiments.\n\nThen there's the perhaps just as if not even more important relationship with Egypt. 80% of the Niles flow comes from Ethiopia, iirc, and an industrialising Ethiopia would find it in their interests to mess with that river regardless of whether or not that's whilst considering the Egyptian position. I could imagine the Ethiopians going hearts and minds and cooperating with the Egyptians post-6-Day-War or whenever it was Nasser was pulled into the western block, or them going full realist and turning Sudan into a de-facto vassal or straight up destabilising it to give Egypt problems. Sudan was fairly respectable in power and quite oil rich though, I don't think I know enough in detail to tell which of these options would make more sense.\n\nThen there's the Saudi's. Who knows, perhaps they could cut a deal with Riyadh for oil and gas access, or they could team up with Iran and bully Riyadh to secure influence over Yemen to tighten their grip on the Bab el Mandab. The latter would definitely attract the sharp end of US diplomacy though, so I'm inclined to lean into the first option. That opens up gaaang doors for the Ethiopians. Now they've got potential oil access from Sudan AND the Saudis, which could nitro boost their industrialisation process.\n\nBut then there's also their internal geography. Building rail links and road infrastructure would probably be difficult. Now I don't know much about the history of Ethiopian internal politics beyond \"oh yeah there was an emperor then a Derg and then a famine and then no more Derg and some shooting matches or something like that\", so I can't say how easy it would be to hook all corners of the country up to Addis Ababa, cost of infrastructure aside. If they do it well, the Ethiopians would become go-to civil engineers and that could increase their soft power in Africa and abroad.\n\nThat's not even assuming they go balls to the wall with the near spiritual influence they have on Africa. Maybe they'd even go full Pan-Africanist and meddle all over the continent. If they're capitalist, the South African ANC and SWAPO would find finding and aid from the Ethiopians before turning to the communist Cubans. With the anti-apartheid movement remaining capitalist (and it's supporters being socially conservative in many ways, as they are today), the Rooi Gevaar (Red Danger, a.k.a the communist argument) of the Apartheid regime would not sell on the international stage and being Anti-Apartheid would not mean helping left-wingers in South Africa. That changes the calculus for the South Africans, and Apartheid either ends more quickly or becomes far more intense and desperate. That would mean a hell of a lot for the future of SA, Namibia, Rhodesia and especially Angola, Zambia and even Mozambique.\n\nNow, knowing the Boers, it's tough to see them give in all too easily. Likely scenario is what I have imagined in previous thought experiments to be termed a National Laager: a hyper militarised (I'm talking Rhodesia level) white South Africa causes total and absolute shitfuckery in Southern Africa. A strong Ethiopia with a land route over freedom loving Tanzania would easily bring the Apartheid military to heads with a technological peer that is far more populous and has the rhetorical backing of the majority of South Africans. The Nats were crazy, but they weren't stupid. This would be suicide for white South Africa, and they'd recognise it.\nAbsolute best case scenario here is a milder apartheid, perhaps something more akin to what the Rhodesians had. Black South Africans would have much more negotiating power, and the racial capabilities argument would be a much tougher sell when there is an industrialised Peer run by K-words dropping freedom-fliers around Soweto. South Africa would be milder, but probably not majority Run for a while, and that changes Southern Africa in so many ways. For one, Angola has a much more positive outlook upon independence, and that country has a lot going for it.\n\nWhat else?",
                "Cold war policy of both superpowers would eventually turn their eyes to the horn, Soviets would likely exploit any secessionist movements in Eritrea or Somali claims on the Ogaden region to destabilise the monarchy\u2019s image to the average Ethiopian. The Economy may survive such hardships, and perhaps Ethiopia could weather the storm, but it would be a difficult storm. The most tumultuous period would be the 1970\u2019s, as Domino Theory and the Brezhnev Doctrine would clash in places like Vietnam, Afghanistan, and perhaps even Ethiopia. While the scale of such a conflict would not be on the same level as either of those, it would no doubt be another theatre in Cold War tensions. France would likely aid in this struggle with Ethiopia, as absorbing such a strategically important base such as Djibouti would have to no doubt come with concessions to the French, concessions which the French would very much want to maintain with the monarchy.\n\nIn the 80\u2019s, I could see by then the Ethiopian monarchy surviving to that point, Haile Selassie\u2019s legacy and perhaps that of future kings could preserve the popularity for it to sustain itself. If the Soviets committed further resources to Ethiopia, I could even see the Red Empire collapsing in the late 80\u2019s instead of the early 90\u2019s. But either way, Ethiopia would survive, perhaps not a mighty power, but definitely a big player in East Africa, maybe lending further stability to the region as a whole and bringing about greater prosperity come the turn of the Millennium.",

It's a country with rich natural resources and an ideal location on the gulf of Aden for international shipping. Issue would arise with Egypt almost immediately due to the Nile. It's why an alliance with Great Britian is so important. It could let Ethiopia industrialized using hydroelectric power without Egypt retaliating militarily, modern events show what a delicate topic water rights are in the region. \n\nA strong Ethiopia allied with the West could be used as a stabilizing force in East Africa during decolonization. But the Soviets would not trust them and likely, once Egypt got independence, I could see a war breaking out between the two regional powers over water rights in the Nile.",

Also Egypt was trying to invade Ethiopia during this time so trade is unlikely. \n\nI guess we could say Ethiopia beats Egypt so bad in this time line they can invade it but that\u2019s pretty far fetched.",

                "I could see something like this still happening where several African nations willfully merge together in order to form an economic powerhouse. Africa is set to become extremly industrialized and is expected to modernize rapidly in the next 25 years and creating a union may be the solution to the security and stability issues that plague the continent. As individuals these countries are weak, but together they could use their combined military forces to trim the fat and then use their economic potential and luxury resources to foster foreign business investments that would insure not only more security but general quality of life improvements such a food security, fully funded hospitals, efficient emergency services, public transport. and a boom in the housing and construction markets. Through all of these things and a fair amount of time,  a large, wealthy, African nation could theoretically form and become a major global player. In this situation I could see almost every current African country breaking out of their colonial boundaries, uniting, and cooperate rather than compete in order to become 10-15 large global powerhouses rather than 54  local powers with minimal global influence"

It should complement a normal property tax system and the other taxes to solve the problems posed by the modern taxation system. A middle of the road path, LVT solves problems we face and the other taxes offset the problems lvt can cause. Think of it as an Estonia type system, where you have both a land value tax and a property tax and the other taxes. Estonia has around 90% owner occupancy in houses and few vacancies, but LVT revenues have only dwindled because land hasn't been valued in a long time. \n\n\nTransitioning entirely to georgism is a risky move but using components of georgism to complement our current economy sounds like a good idea.",

According to some reports and witnesses, Hamas security officers used force to disperse the protesters. Scores of Palestinians were arrested and injured, they claimed.\n> \n> The demonstrations are seen by Palestinians as a big embarrassment for the Hamas leaders, many of whom are currently based in Qatar, Turkey, and Lebanon. Yet, at this stage, the protests do not seem to pose a real threat to Hamas\u2019s rule over the coastal enclave.\n> \n> Similar protests took place in the [Gaza Strip](https://www.jpost.com/opinion/article-743534) four years ago under the slogan \u201cWe want to live!\u201d The protests, however, were quickly suppressed by Hamas security forces and militiamen belonging to its armed wing, Izaddin al-Qassam. Then, Hamas accused its rivals in the ruling Fatah faction headed by [Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas](https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/article-750175) of being behind the protests.\n> \n> The latest protests coincided with increased talk about a possible reconciliation between [Fatah and Hamas](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-749308).\n> \n>  Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan meet with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Palestinian group Hamas' top leader Ismail Haniyeh at the Presidential Palace in Ankara, Turkey, July 26, 2023. (credit: Palestinian President Office(PPO)/Handout via REUTERS)\n> \n> Last week, Abbas and Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh met in Turkey to discuss ways of achieving \u201cnational unity\u201d and ending the dispute that erupted between the two parties after Hamas won the 2006 parliamentary election.\n> \n> On Sunday, Abbas and Haniyeh attended a conference of leaders of several Palestinian factions in Egypt in yet another attempt to end the Fatah-Hamas rivalry and reach an agreement on the formation of a Palestinian unity government.\n> \n> The conference, however, [ended without agreement](https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/article-753066), with Hamas rejecting Abbas\u2019s call for endorsing a \u201cpeaceful popular resistance\u201d against Israel. Hamas also made it clear at the conference that it would not adhere to any political program that recognizes Israel or the agreements signed between the Palestinians and Israelis over the past three decades.\n> \n> ### **What were the major Palestinian protests in Gaza on Sunday?**\n> \n> It was not clear whether the latest protests in the Gaza Strip were part of a larger campaign against Hamas. It was also unclear whether a single party was behind the demonstrations.\n> \n> On Sunday night, hundreds of Hamas supporters also took to the streets in a show of force and to express support for the Islamist movement.\n> \n> A leaflet signed by the \u201cYouth Movement\u201d thanked the \u201cheroic\u201d residents of the Gaza Strip for heeding its call to take to the streets on July 30 to voice their \u201crejection of oppression, hunger, and the bad economic situation.\u201d\n> \n> The group said it had issued a two-week ultimatum to the Hamas leadership to implement the \u201cjust demands\u201d of the people. \u201cWe have broken the barrier of fear and silence,\u201d the group said. It condemned the arrests and physical assaults carried out by Hamas security forces against the protesters and called on local and international human rights organizations to intervene to secure the release of all those who were detained in the past few days. \u201cWe announce the continuation and expansion of our peaceful revolution until all our demands are met,\u201d the group added.\n> \n> During some of the protests, Palestinians chanted slogans calling for an immediate end to the economic crisis, including the blockade imposed on the Gaza Strip.

            "selftext": "The Mumbai-Pune-Nashik triangle has the highest economic potential in India. If this area is developed on the likes of the Pearl River Delta, it can help propel the Indian economic growth to unprecedented levels. This area will simply be the richest, most industrialised and most developed region of India with the highest economic and global trade contribution of any economic zone in the country. \n\nPearl River Delta is an economic zone of China that comprises of the mega cities of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Macau, Foshan and few other cities. This area constitutes of about 0.7% of China\u2019s landmass and 4% of its population. With a GDP of about $2 trillion, PRD contributes more than 12% to China\u2019s GDP and 25% of its trade. 30% of foreign investment in China is in PRD. In PRD, Hong Kong is the finance hub, Shenzhen is technology hub, Guangzhou is a global trading hub, and, Foshan and Dongguan and manufacturing centres. And Macau is a tourism and entertainment center.\n\n**India\u2019s opportunity for potential PRD-like economic zone**\n\nIndia can build its own PRD like economic zone, in the Mumbai-Pune-Nashik region. Mumbai is the financial capital, Pune can be the largest technology and industrial hub, Navi Mumbai can be the global trading hub, and, Nashik is a booming manufacturing center and the wine capital of India. This area can be further extended to Aurangabad, which an another booming industrial area and can be a textile manufacturing hub thanks to plentiful availability of cotton in the region. \n\nThis area also has great tourism potential with places like Lonavla, Alibag, Aurangabad (Ajanta and Ellora), Mahabaleshwar and Nashik. Moreover, this area also a lot to offer to religious tourists as well: 3 jyotirlingas, Shirdi, Ashtavinayak, etc. \n\nNashik has a gigantic economic potential that\u2019s not being tapped into. Nashik is the wine capital of India with approx 70% of India\u2019s all vineyards. If the wine industry of Nashik is invested in and it\u2019s products are strategically promoted nationally and internationally, Nashik will give birth to a multi-billion dollar industry. The world alcohol market stands at a gargantuan $2.1 trillion. Capturing even 1% of the market size will result in colossal revenue. Ex- Champagne became a $ 8 billion market just by strategic position and marketing as a luxury celebration drink. Italy\u2019s Prosecco tastes similar (Valdobbiadene brand especially) but is available at 15% of champagne\u2019s price. So marketing does wonders.\n\nNagpur can be a further engine of economic growth by being the logistics hub, as it will be at the crossroads of two upcoming dedicated freight corridors (East-West and North-South) and the international cargo handling facility at Nagpur Airport MIHAN.\n\n**How can it be done?**\n\nThe economic potential of this area is immense and if strategic investment and infrastructure development is done here, it can propel India\u2019s economic growth massively. \n\n-Currently, there is no proper connectivity in this area. It takes 4 hours to travel from Mumbai-Pune (distance is just 150 km) and more than 4 hours for Mumbai-Nashik (distance 170 km). The average travel speed for both routes is a disappointing 40 km/hr. \nThere is a need to high/semi-high speed trains connecting the cities in this area to provide a seamless and streamlined movement of people and goods. With semi-high speed trains (avg speed 125 kmph), the travel time between Mumbai-Pune, Mumbai Nashik and Pune-Nashik will be cut to less than 1.5 hours. And high-speed rail (avg speed 250+ kmph) will reduce this time to less than 40 minutes!!\n\n-Dedicated freight corridors are needed for faster transportation of cargo to the port. \n\n**The positive impact of Mumbai-Pune-Nashik greater economic zone**\n\n-If this area is developed as a big economic zone and a streamlined megapolis with seamless connectivity it will become the biggest engine of growth and wealth generation in India and will simply be the wealthiest region with highest GDP per capita. It will account to largest share of economic, industrial and trade activity compared to any other area in India.\n\n-It will also reduce the burden on Mumbai and its ever so expensive real estate. At this point Mumbai is not even seamlessly connected with Navi Mumbai. Fast transportation will reduce the need to relocate to Mumbai and bring down the real estate prices. Real estate prices in other areas will also go up thereby generating wealth in those areas too. \n\n-This area will easily make Pune the biggest technology hub in India (like Shenzhen). Pune currently has the 4th highest number of startups in India (after Delhi NCR, Bangalore and Mumbai) and is the biggest automobile hub in India. Also, big tech firms are heavily investing in Pune for IoT and cloud technologies which is where the next tech revolution will happen. \n\n-Aurangabad can potentially be a textile manufacturing hub as this area is one of the biggest producers of cotton. Also, Ajanta and Ellora are two of the most underrated tourist attractions, with proper promotion they can be a global rage and generate thousands of crores in tourism revenue \n\n-Religious tourism is big in India and generates a lot of revenue. A this area has a lot of prominent religious places",

            "title": "Why economic calculation is theoretically impossible under socialism",
            "selftext": "There's been a bit of discussion around the economic calculation problem (ECP) as first described by Austrian economist Ludwig Von Mises in 1920. Socialists seem to be under the impression that, given Mises' article is over 100 years old that it isn't relevant to the modern age. So while he may have had a point in the pre-computer, pre-Internet age, the advent of such innovations has allowed us to solve the issue.\n\nI will argue that the ECP remains unsolved in even if we assume the following:\n\n1. the planning board has perfect technical knowledge of every possible combination of factors (through time) and their possible consumption good outputs and this knowledge is updated instantaneously with changing conditions.\n2. a planning board has perfect insight into every individual\u2019s ordinal preference ranking of every hypothetical consumption good imaginable which is also updated instantaneously with changes to those preferences.\n\nI want to be pretty methodical here so I will try to explain the crux of the calculation problem, explain how markets with private property and money solve the problem and make my argument for the impossibility of economic calculation under socialism.\n\nRemember that the fundamental assumption of a socialist system \u2013 its defining characteristic that, without which we could not call it a socialist system \u2013 is that there is no private ownership in capital goods. Only one agent of decision-making is allowed to determine the structure of production. If we allow independent decision-making with capital (specifically, buying and selling), then we\u2019re not talking about socialism anymore.\n\n**1. What is the ECP?**\n\nWhat is the economic calculation problem? Simply put, it is the fact that, being scarce, resources must be economized. We have to be able to ensure that we\u2019re using scarce resources in a way where we are satisfying the most important consumer values first and giving up as little value as possible to do so. Thus, economizing resources requires one to know how much something is \u201cworth\u201d.\n\n**2. How do markets resolve the ECP?**\n\nEconomization is essentially inherent in our decision to consume this or that good because the consumption goods are the whole point. We\u2019re directly aware of the satisfactions involved in the goods we\u2019re consuming. A choice to consume X over Y is an economization. Furthermore, since we can trade consumption goods for other consumption goods we can each economize amongst each other for these goods. Indeed, the socialist system (and Mises\u2019 argument) assumes that a free market exists in consumption goods and even money emerges in this market. Economization here is involved in trade by definition because we\u2019re effectively gaining and giving up direct-use satisfactions.\n\nHowever, we don\u2019t directly consume capital goods, so we have no direct way of knowing what they\u2019re worth and without this information, we can\u2019t know if what we\u2019re using those goods to produce is \u201cworth it\u201d. In choosing between two production processes, how do we compare them in a value sense? This is an important distinction: what is the most technically efficient is not what we\u2019re concerned about when comparing production processes.\n\nFor example, imagine that we\u2019re interested in making 100 shoes and there are two possible ways of making these 100 shoes. Say that process A uses the least matter, the least energy, and the least amount of time, but it also requires the use of diamond-laden, gold-dipped, platinum tools. Process B uses more matter, more energy, and a greater amount of time, but only uses wood and iron. In this hypothetical, process A might be the most technically efficient, but it is likely extremely value-inefficient.\n\nYet, how do we actually know process A has a higher cost than process B? I made these examples purposefully blatant, but I\u2019m relying on our shared experience in a context where we know the inputs for process A are really valuable and process B aren\u2019t as valuable. Starting from scratch, we wouldn\u2019t have this knowledge, so how could we look at these two processes and say \u201cavoid process A\u201d?\n\nWe have to be able to compare them. Unfortunately, goods are not directly comparable across individuals with respect to value. Trying to compare them is like trying to compare apples and oranges. Why is this? Why can\u2019t we say that apples are \u201cworth more\u201d than oranges? Because the value we give them is entirely subjective and subjective value is incomparable between individuals. There is no way to measure value. This is literally impossible. Moreover, comparison of production is even more difficult because, as stated above, capital goods are not consumed directly. Not only can we not compare them in a value sense, but we also don\u2019t even have a hypothetical value to give them.\n\nThe key to resolving this issue is money. Because consumption goods are exchanged directly for money, every person has a well-formed understanding of \u201cthe value of a dollar\u201d in their capacity as a consumer. They know a dollar can get them \u201cn\u201d units of some good, some good means \u201cthis\u201d much to them, therefore a dollar means about \u201cthis\u201d much to them. We are intimately familiar with how it \u201cfeels\u201d to obtain and to give up dollars because we know the satisfaction we\u2019re getting or losing. It should be emphasized, though, that money is not a measurement of value because subjective values cannot be measured.\n\nFurthermore, in a market economy with a division of labor, every person has two roles: consumer and producer. As they put on producer hats, they still have their own personal understanding of what dollars are worth from their role as a consumer. Their buying and selling of production goods and services (which includes labor hours) stamps upon these goods and services each producer\u2019s own psychic perspective about what they\u2019re \u201cworth\u201d indirectly by being exchanged for money. No one demands production goods for their own sake (by definition). The way the relative urgency of these goods manifests is by people exchanging them against things that are more closely associated with the actual direct-use satisfactions with which everyone is familiar; ie: money. Again, the values of goods are still locked up in people\u2019s heads and money is not a quantification of value, but it is a reference point with which everyone is familiar.Remember, above we said that we need to be able to compare production processes in a value sense. We now have something we can work with. We know the value we place on units of money and, importantly, money is an objective thing that can act as a unit of comparison; each unit is considered homogenous with other units and it stands on one side of every transaction in the market. Now, we can determine if we\u2019re maximizing satisfaction and minimizing cost. We simply calculate profits and losses in terms of money. If a production process is profitable, then we know that the process was \u201cworth it\u201d.\n\n**3. Why can\u2019t socialism resolve the ECP?**\n\nSocialism is incapable of calculating because it prohibits the authentic exchange of capital goods for money. This is necessarily true according to the definition of socialism. If one agent of planning (the state, the community, the planning board, etc) owns all of the productive resources, then exchange in a value sense is literally impossible. The planning agent could tell the coal syndicate to exchange \u201cn\u201d tons of coal with the iron syndicate for \u201cm\u201d tons of iron, but this is no more meaningful than if it told its right hand to exchange an apple for an orange in its left. In other words, the movement of resources occurs, but it is devoid of meaning economically. Or, more specifically, the only meaning present is the planner\u2019s.\n\nOn a deeper level, even here the planner is at a loss for what meaning (in a sense of direct satisfaction of goods) such a transaction entails because a planner still isn\u2019t consuming capital directly. What is the opportunity cost, even on the planner\u2019s own terms, for such a transaction? What is coal worth? What is iron worth? The only way the planner can attach any value meaning to such a transaction is if he is perfectly aware of exactly what consumption resources he is giving up by making such a trade. This requires a perfect appraisal of future conditions and perfect technical information. This is unrealistic.\n\nNevertheless, let\u2019s introduce the first assumption from above: the planner has perfect technical knowledge of every combination of production goods and their possible consumption good outputs through time and this knowledge is instantly updated with new information as it occurs.\n\nWhat does this get us? It doesn\u2019t really get \u201cus\u201d anything, but it gets the planner, and only the planner, everything. Decisions made by the planner are motivated by the planner and thus necessarily based upon the planner\u2019s preferences. The planner can know that using this or that production good in this and that way will allow this or that consumption good to come into existence in however many years, but this presupposes that the planner\u2019s preferences for consumption goods are being economized. This isn\u2019t a resolution to the economic calculation problem which assumes that everyone\u2019s consumption preferences must be economized.\n\nOkay, let\u2019s introduce the second assumption from above: that the planner has perfect insight into everyone\u2019s ordinal preference ranking for every possible consumption good imaginable, and this knowledge is instantly updated as those rankings change.\n\nAt first glance, this would seem to resolve the problem. The planner knows precisely how to make everything imaginable down to the minute it will become available and is perfectly aware of the placement of each hypothetical consumption good on each individual\u2019s internal value scale. The planner now knows what to produce and how to produce such that each production process has the lowest opportunity cost possible, right?\n\nNo, because the planner has no way of comparing value scales. Comparing two value scales is like comparing apples and oranges.\n\nThis is very important so for the sake of clarity, I want to set up an example to drive the point home. Imagine we\u2019re on a desert island and there is some omniscient planner that satisfies assumptions one and two who and this planner is organizing the production for Robinson Crusoe and Friday, the only other residents of the island. We\u2019ll say that there are only two goods on Crusoe\u2019s and Friday\u2019s internal value scales: coconuts and fish. They don\u2019t have any preference for anything else. Furthermore, there are only two production processes available: one makes coconuts, but completely at the expense of fish. The other makes fish, but completely at the expense of coconuts. There are no other options. The planner must decide whether to make fish or make coconuts. Crusoe wants coconuts more than fish. Friday wants fish more than coconuts. What does the planner produce?\n\nIt should be clear that, for the planner, this problem is unresolvable with respect to Crusoe and Friday. Whose preference is more important? The planner does not and cannot know. There is no way of comparing these two preference rankings. The planner could simply choose, but would still be incapable of validating whether this choice was in line with consumer (ie: Crusoe and Friday) preferences.\n\nLet\u2019s understand clearly what has just been stated. This problem is so fundamental that even if we tried to introduce a third assumption where the planners can compare value scales across individuals, this assumption would actually be logically nonsensical. Assumptions one and two are practically impossible, but theoretically, we could imagine maybe some psychic super-engineer that satisfies those assumptions. There is no logical conflict here. It\u2019s science-fiction, but not \u201cAlice in Wonderland\u201d. Even this god-like entity couldn\u2019t compare value scales because there is literally no unit of comparison. It is essentially like saying you can compare meters to seconds directly. This just doesn\u2019t make sense.\n\nSocialism is theoretically, not practically, impossible.",

                "If diamonds, gold and platinum took less average social time to produce than wood and iron, they'd **generally** be cheaper than wood and iron.  Insofar as increased demand caused their price to rise above their value and exceed the price of wood and iron, in a competitive market capital would shift from wood and iron producers to diamonds, gold, and platinum producers in realization of greater profits.\n\nThis re-allocation of capital, thereby increasing relative supply and brings prices back to down below wood and iron.\n\nAt first glance this appears to prove your thesis.  Only by knowing these prices can capital be allocated \"efficiently,\" i.e be known to be \"worth\" moving from wood and iron production to diamond, gold, and steel production.  And only by seeing the price of one exceed the other can producers who can produce with either know to switch to one or the other.  Just the same we might say that without capital migration, increased demand for the now cheaper wood and iron will increase their prices until they rise back above the price of diamonds, gold, and platinum.\n\nBut, as Marx said... \n\n> We might just as well consider the fluctuations as the law, and the determination of the price by cost of production as an accident ... it is precisely these fluctuations that force the price to conform to the cost of production.\n\nSo your \"efficient allocation\" is nothing more than one reaction to some past condition offset by another once sufficient time has passed to tell us what the reaction to that reaction should be; once the results and consequences of that reaction have echoed through the various spheres and related spheres of industry throwing workers out of work, abandoning entire blocks of productive equipment, manifesting in every form of distorting opportunism as each capitalist vies with one another for the greater shares of surplus along the way.  From price gouging, to rent hikes, to regulatory capture, to credit schemes, etc, the whole of capitalist society constantly uprooting itself only to reveal the inescapable core at the center of the rotten apple.\n\n> In the total course of this industrial anarchy, in this circular movement, competition balances, as it were, **the one extravagance by the other.**\n\nOnly to reveal what we knew all along.  _The real value of any thing is the amount of toil and trouble we can be spared to obtain it._  accordingly, the relationship between price and value, though apparent, is not necessary.  The apparent need to signal to our fellow man through a price, the real relation that enables a rise or fall in price to correlate to definite rises and falls in the distribution and division of our total social labor power, mediated by the social average time it takes to produce, to this or that thing over this or that thing, is nothing more than the product of bourgeois social relations themselves.\n\nThe ECP is nothing more than the imaginary problem at the end of solution that doesn't have one.\n\nWhen the whole of human social labor no longer stands as the indirect relation of its individual constituent parts with one another; when the exchange of one good or service for another or their universal equivalent (money) no longer embodies this relation; when labor relates directly to labor; when wages cease and goods are produced directly for social use, only then will the obvious answer of what to produce, why, and towards what ends be actually possible to answer, because only at that point will we return to conscious and meaningful deliberation.  Only then will we be restored as masters over our creation in place of being ruled over by it.\n\nUntil then we are all slaves to capital, including the capitalists who represent little more than the bodies and minds it has possessed.  So, go ahead... keep telling yourself how we just need to obey a balance sheet and a profit margin, I'm sure the next rounds of workers to be laid off will appreciate the \"efficiency\" of it all while they're eating their retirement.",

This is necessarily true according to the definition of socialism. If one agent of planning (the state, the community, the planning board, etc) owns all of the productive resources, then exchange in a value sense is literally impossible\n\nThe main reason ECP is unconvincing to me wholly is because the authors who present it usually start off with trying to pin down and reduce what socialism is in a single axiom. Usually following by a long rant about the USSR. De Soto spends 17 pages rambing about the USSR. I've heard socialism be reduced to \"when you prohibit entrepreneurship\" or Mises - when you have just one entity making economic decisions.\n\nEven if I were to agree that, if we had an economy where there is a single entity making **all** the economic decisions - and nobody can ever do anything independently without going through the bureaucracy of planning - that this would lead to some sort of calculation problem.... how is that a problem for socialism?\n\nWe will never get to a point where literally everything is planned by some administration. I cannot imagine people will ever want to live in a society where their dinners are pre planned and the amount of times they will shit and flush pre planned as well. Economic planning will almost definitely be reserved for the peaks of the economy - the general direction of the economy, the large state owned firms, currency supply may all be planned directly, but the sort of production happening on a personal level - like me running my family farm will not be subject to direct or even indirect state planning.\n\nWithout this axiom that socialism = one entity acting alone - ECP does not hold.",

Markets don't solve that issue, they just give the wealthy people more power to shape the production and distribution in valuing their scales over the scales of the less wealthy.\n\nIn a similar fashion, \"socialism\" could \"solve\" the issue by giving party officials the power to weight the scales entirely on their whim.",

                "Socialism is not about planning. Capitalists like the Waltons, J.P. Morgan, and Jeff Bezos dream of center planning and one giant monopoly capitalist just as some socialists dreamed of the same (or similar). \n\nSocialism is workers control of the means of production and the appropriation of the fruits of their own labors (whether solo labor appropriated alone or collective labor appropriated as a collective). This means also the appropriation and distribution of their surplus labor as they determine to advance their own interests (and not the interests of an oppugnant and tyrannical ruling class). Socialism also brings with it the stewardship of common wealth and other common concerns through a Commonwealth rule of law, where that law is determined by science, democratic deliberation, and finally appeal to reason to ensure no reign over individual personal spheres occurs (in other words, as Engels paraphrase Saint-Simon: \u201cThe government of persons is replaced by the administration of things and the direction of the processes of production\u201d). Socialism can involve allocation/rationing with markets as much as central planning. However when socialism involves markets they are freed from the manipulation, command, and control by the capitalist ruling class. In socialist markets rationing according to one\u2019s ability and willingness to pay, it is far superior than capitalist markets because in socialism one\u2019s ability to pay is determined by one\u2019s contributions to society. In capitalism one\u2019s ability to pay is largely determined by the anti-social activities of exploiting the greatest mass of workers and pilfering from the public treasury its natural resources and natural resource rents.\n\nAt best your diatribe could prove the central planning dreamed about by capitalist and socialists alike cannot work. However, you really have failed on that front as well. You have just as much demonstrated that markets cannot be evaluated in the affirmative as achieving what they claim to achieve. We are then left with only being able to say that neither markets nor central planking can be proved as superior. It\u2019s really just a matter of taste to select one or the other. I personally do not agree, nor do I think you have proven much of interest at all. But that is the most we could conclude, if we were charitable, from this nonsense.\n\nEDIT: you have basically assumed the market allocate perfectly, cut out all of the legs necessary to make an evaluation of a \u2018good\u2019 allocation, and then tried to use the cutoff legs to claim the central planning failed to do as perfectly as the market.

It allocates goods and services to those who value them most *and are able to pay for them*. Unless people have an equal ability to pay for things - that is, unless wealth is distributed equally - the market prices for consumption goods will be distorted, and the needs of poor people will not adequately be met.

There are a series of giant problems with your core criticism of socialism (that the planner does not know what consumer preferences are). \n\n1) the planner does not need to give a shit about consumer preferences because consumer preferences are often unworthy of being satisfied. Moreover, consumers themselves often do not know what their preferences are. \n\n2) in the case of Crusoe and Friday, we actually could say that they each have the same underlying major preference (to eat nutritious food). Given that, which cuisine preference is more nutritious? Crusoe and Friday may not know and thus may actually desire food which they do not--in a deeper sense--truly desire at all. The planner may have a better sense of the underlying preferences of Crusoe and Friday than they do themselves.\n\n3) you are making a preference utilitarian argument that markets do the best job of maximizing social good, but for that to be true on the grounds you using, each person's preferences would have to be weighed equally by markets. But for that to be the case, money would have to be distributed equally. It is not within capitalism. By contrast, to reject the idea that each individual's preferences need to be weighed equally is to trash the underlying universality of the utilitarian position. It leaves us with no grounds for caring whether anyone's preferences other than our own are satisfied.\n\n4) unlike fish and coconuts many of the most commonly desired things cannot appear for sale in markets at all, and those things are often threatened by markets. \n\nFrankly, the idea that the planner cannot know for sure what the good for each individual is just reeks of a cultish fear of uncertainty. Ironically, this fear is used as a defense of a system which certainly does fail to correctly calculate the common good."

They even say stocks disclosed have decreased price action (we know that is the effect of short sellers and so do they).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b1foci3kmeab1.png?width=797&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed21b12d0c16164865c9d952631679a7ccbc2bab\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/whe3taknmeab1.png?width=492&format=png&auto=webp&s=f03c3806c794716e61101110181b0c49f78ac8fb\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wyxjl90pmeab1.png?width=595&format=png&auto=webp&s=9bb2ebf618f44286aea9085d25b25cd3a30f7bcf\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0yyd5q8hmeab1.png?width=591&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1c2c661ebb3c35b4c90afaaf21cb9258dd4b5c3\n\nOn pg 16 they discusses 1/28/21 GME\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a4iryrgrmeab1.png?width=491&format=png&auto=webp&s=c381675ddab03861cfc44f5adf208d2fc0df0fea\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w66re3btmeab1.png?width=495&format=png&auto=webp&s=a0cb2942b184ffef328cc0091107f47db2a80ce6\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/he7i508zmeab1.png?width=513&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c1a6011e1db0699b6dffc7e48937b824e499d6b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hdcgnw55neab1.png?width=569&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f212ddecbeae994baee73f349fb8893678d8196\n\n[https://www.copenhageneconomics.com/dyn/resources/Publication/publicationPDF/3/573/1626345387/market-impact-of-short-sale-position-disclosures.pdf](https://www.copenhageneconomics.com/dyn/resources/Publication/publicationPDF/3/573/1626345387/market-impact-of-short-sale-position-disclosures.pdf)\n\nHere are the authors of the report:  Dr Asger Lunde, Jonas Bjarke Jensen, Dr Frederik Plum,Hauschultz, Stephanie Tizik\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNext study linked:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g2n0vvkdneab1.png?width=695&format=png&auto=webp&s=3949cee8eedb36e3a47c757eaeee2436bd89273a\n\n[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X20302075](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X20302075)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNext link: SEC RULE regarding Insider trading and reporting requirements:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.sec.gov\\/rules\\/final\\/33-7881.htm](https://preview.redd.it/7gautwboneab1.png?width=548&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f379727dafef4f472255936ea23493aa2b2177c)\n\nNext:\n\nA finance Article from Inwestowanie\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https:\\/\\/inwestujfinanse.pl\\/corporate-disclosure-practices-institutional-investors-and-stock-return-volatility\\/](https://preview.redd.it/9isbzijwneab1.png?width=1179&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e7ac318d6e36ab65052d14f34dfbf1cf5f89c01)\n\nNext Link:\n\nA book for sale discussing market liquidity\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.jstor.org\\/stable\\/23047101](https://preview.redd.it/sdaq96x2oeab1.png?width=1468&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd010d9c52bc494c37bd570a3c901caae695ee67)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLast Link:\n\nSIFMA article about more consideration needed for SEC 10B-1 rule\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.sifma.org\\/resources\\/news\\/public-disclosure-of-security-based-swaps-positions-significant-further-consideration-is-needed\\/](https://preview.redd.it/6ndkedzeoeab1.png?width=942&format=png&auto=webp&s=4548fab7d205012c813da8f17835af1ac5c7c1d8)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHOLY SHIT APE!

It is impossible to predict the actions of others and due to the recession predictions actions were taken to prevent the recession from materializing. A forecast is not a deterministic prophecy. \n\nIf we went 100% clean energy tomorrow and sequestered all the human produced green house gases would all of the climate change forecasts be wrong? Would we be discussing where they went wrong?",

                "Their are some extraordinary economic drivers that were not taken into account\u2026\n\n1. The abundance of jobs due to retirements during the pandemic and changing workforce skill availability. \n\n2. Pay increases due to supply and demand of labor have helped better the blow of inflation.\n\n3. Temporary excess income due to post pandemic governmental policy, such as student loan repayment pause.\n\nI am in the camp they got the timing of a recession WAY wrong, but I still DO NOT think we avoided one. Because\u2026\n\n1. There is an actual cost to borrowing now for the first time in almost 15 years, the global economy was built on cheap money, it takes a period of time for the inability to borrow cheaply to trickle thru the systems. \n\n2. US Student loan repayments restart very soon, this will remove billions of dollars in buying power of people usually in their higher acquisition of vital asset years.\n\n3. Buying power from equity from home ownership is going to be a challenge because of higher interest rates pushing lower valuations on houses that were FOMO purchased at values derived from cheap borrowing costs and lack of supply during the pandemic. Look as a chart of historical home value appreciation, over the past 15 years it\u2019s WILD how juiced they are from the low interest rates and panic buying.",

We have around 175 jobs on the books every year, plus some random ones, too. This year, we have 29 on the books, no random projects. It's going to get bad. Also, we must look at savings and retirement, which is at a all time low, and credit card debt is the highest ever recorded.

So rather than look at actual backlogs and orders for inventory etc, we use peoples \"feelings\"..\nThese projections have been forecasting a recession for almost 2 years... The jobs numbers alone should tell you that the economy is doing well... Employers dont hire people for the fun of it. Its to meet customer demand..Doesnt matter the industry. \n\nThe other reason that we have been predicting a recession? Because thats the only way that we know how to counteract inflation.. Raise rates and induce a recession..",

They could also use the recession as a reason to lay off all the hourly employees, cut their overhead even MORE.

This article did a good job of covering that aspect.\n\nThe second, which I am really surprised people aren't so concerned with, is has the recession call actually been wrong, or is the timing just off. This idea that inflation has been solved - are people really buying into that? Now OER will probably keep official CPI numbers down for a while, and if the market keeps going up, perhaps this gives Biden enough runway to get reelected. But inflation has not gone away. Prices are going up, and there are still inflationary pressures and expectations. To reverse that, eventually Powell probably will need to hike a lot more than people think (after the election?) Probably it means much higher unemployment. Probably it means a pretty bad recession. The ball is in Powell's court.",

As the Senators chant \"Long live the banks!\" Palpatine accepts the responsibility with great humility, promising to return the banks to their former standing once the Clone Wars end.\n\nConsidering there's no delay in the transition to the Office of the Emperor, I assume the Emperor have all control of the InterGalactic Bank (the largest bank in the galaxy). Due to major simplification of the Galactic economy, my best guess the Galactic Bank is operating both as consumer/retail banks and as central bank.\n\nAs there's no check and balances, Palpatine can do anything as he pleased and no one can fight against him due to his power. The economy is basically held up by a single individual.\n\nAs implication, Palpatine theoretically can print all the money that he wants to fund his \"projects\". However, unrestricted money creation will lead to inflationary prices (or it should be). Perhaps there are some measures used by Palpatine to avoid such inflation in public by not \"really\" paying for his projects.\n\nFor example, in the construction of Death Star, the Imperial Government doesn't need to pay for slave labourers and perhaps steal materials from planets without compensation. The money created only used to pay Stormtroopers and Imperial Officers (perhaps with a constant wage increase to fight the inflation).\n\nIn turn this will create a wealthy nobility class created from old republican political elites, Imperial Officers and Troopers. The wage increase according to inflation should be a strong incentive to join the Imperial rank and file, while also create more economic suffering which fuels the fervor for rebellion.\n\nNo one can amass wealth while opposing the Imperial Government. If a corporation amass wealth, the Empire can crack down on them and take their wealth with brute force. If a Planetary government amass wealth, taxes can be increased for the particular planet.\n\nThis will theoretically made credits value-less. Only happy worthless numbers to make the Imperial citizens feel some sense of normalcy in the economy. Its value is as determined by the Emperor, no more and no less."

That time was spent on growing food, learning a skill, or creating a product. There are also material costs, but what is valued the most are people's time.\n\n\nSo what business can you create? You can create a time trade business. Someone needs a job done but can't afford to pay for it? Then you get them to sell their time for a different job.\n\nIt works just like currency, it creates jobs, and gives people things to do too. Very little money would actually be exchanged, of course money \"could be exchanged\" if they have it. If not people could exchange their time instead.\n\nYou can start it up from a storefront, or an app/website too.

This one is kinda joking, but at the same time Japanese video games would be a massive part of their tech and entertainment sector so if they want to be \u201cit\u201d I can imagine Nintendo milking LoZ as the ultimate open world RPG title. \n\nJapanese elderly would move on masse to Florida and Latin America, this would grow the economies of the countries they retire to (presumably Costa Rica and Panama). The large expat population would make it common for people in those countries to learn Japanese. I say this because I imagine they\u2019d want to leave the densely populated Japan and go somewhere kinda humid and tropical, Japan is a very humid area and the far south gets kind of tropical. They wouldn\u2019t go somewhere with deserts like western USA or Spain since it\u2019s too dry for them to be used to. \n\nWe\u2019d have a bigger divide on \u201cdollar\u201d countries vs \u201cyen\u201d countries. Exchanging currencies is a very rough and specialized process. For example, it\u2019s rare for Argentinians and Swedes to do business but it does happen, hence why they both use US dollars since it\u2019s more in-demand than Kronas or Pesos. In this world, markets heavily dependent on Japan would probably use Yen when dealing with each other. We already see some emerging examples of this happening with Yuan as an increasing number of countries do more with China than America. At some point, whoever Japan does business with will have to use Japanese money as their intermediary as they\u2019d have more reason to store Yen over Dollars in general. \n\nAmerica will probably lose a lot of its global power. The point of American economic dominance is to allow America to dictate what countries do. America would lose that leverage if Japan is ever willing to work with countries that America isn\u2019t particularly happy to. A good example of this in OTL is trade with Iran. Basically, because America has so many major Iranian people and corporations sanctioned, anyone that wants to do business with America can\u2019t do business with those Iranians, which happen to be pretty much any Iranian worth trading with anyway. If Japan had the ability to dictate the terms of trade and economic might, American sanctions become less impactful and ultimately people are freer to choose business partners. This is assuming Japan would ever trade with someone America didn\u2019t want to.",

                "In *The Coming War with Japan*, published in 1991, George Friedman postulates an escalating conflict with Japan. Per a Wikipedia summary:\n\nFriedman and LeBard argue in the book that, with the USSR in a state of collapse and with the Cold War coming to a close at the time, the United States was more likely to come into conflict with Japan as the US no longer had sufficient reason to tolerate what the authors believed to be Japanese economic encroachment. Friedman and LeBard predicted that a series of trade wars between the US and Japan would lead to a final rupture between the two countries. The authors also expressed the view that, as with Imperial Japan in the 1930s and 40s, Japan would seek to take control of sources of raw materials and force the US out of the western Pacific. The authors saw the only alternative to a hot war between the US and Japan as being a \"long, miserable cold war\".\n\nThe authors also made predictions about Europe, predicting that by 1992 European integration would lead to the US being \"pushed out of\" markets in Europe and the USSR. Friedman and LeBard further predicted that this would lead to isolationism and \"Japan-bashing\" being adopted by candidates in the 1992 US presidential elections, leading to a drive to exclude Japanese imports from the US market.\n\nFriedman and LeBard believed that the Japanese armed forces could be expanded rapidly into \"a world-class military force\". They also considered that Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution was only a \"legal fiction\" and would not prevent Japanese rearmament or aggression. To meet this perceived threat, Friedman and LeBard proposed that the US Navy be kept at its 1991 size, and the US Marine Corps be doubled in size, with this being paid for by cuts to the US Army and strategic forces.\n\nFriedman and LeBard expected that a conflict between Japan and America would unfold within \"a generation\" and that the world would \"settle into a new cold war before a hot war threatens\". They predicted that the casus belli would be the shutting off of supplies of raw materials to Japan by US action. A map accompanying the book portrayed the Asia-Pacific region as being divided into US and Japanese spheres of influence by the year 2000, with Indonesia, North Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, and Burma portrayed as Japanese allies, whilst Taiwan, Australia, Singapore, and South Korea were portrayed as being in the US sphere of influence, with other territories (including China, Vietnam, Mongolia, the Philippines, Laos, and Cambodia) being marked as \"contested\".\n\nThe original book jacket of the book stated that \"conflict will escalate in the next two decades to include the possibility\u2014indeed probability\u2014of an armed conflict, a second US\u2013Japanese war in the Pacific\". Later editions replaced this statement with positive reviews.",

That is a nice way of saying: some people raised prices more than they needed because of greed, which is why all your stuff is more expensive.  And too bad, you don\u2019t get to set the prices.\n\nWe should worry less about how much national debt we have and more about how we can have monetary and fiscal policies that allow us to do things other countries have managed to do despite NOT being \u201cnumber one\u201d and despite also being in shit situations like us. No set of policies is perfect but it would be great to learn from other countries who have a high level of national debt instead of constant oh no wtf look at the national debt articles.  It\u2019s a ledger of bond sales, not a one to one reflection of why we have inflation.

National debt owed in foreign currency in a scenario where the dollar isn\u2019t the a desirable currency for the global market anymore\n\nThese are far more important to avoid than some multiple that the national debt will grow by in x amount of years, but alas, \u201cnational debt\u201d sounds cool to say when you\u2019re running for office and need to take a hard stance on something.  By all means, use it to scare people into paying more taxes, by god we know some who could offer more.  But don\u2019t come back to me point at the debt and say this is why we can\u2019t have nice things because you weren\u2019t allowed to sell financial securities before you printed money.

                "So?  \n\nWhile high national debt is often a concern, there are several reasons why it may not necessarily be a problem:\n\n1. Economic Stimulus: Debt can be used to stimulate the economy during times of recession by funding public services and infrastructure projects. This can spur economic growth which, in turn, generates tax revenues to help pay off the debt.\n\n2. Investment in Future Growth: Borrowing can be used to invest in areas like education, healthcare, and infrastructure, which can lead to longer-term economic benefits. These investments can improve productivity and the standard of living, leading to stronger economic growth.\n\n3. Low Interest Rates: When interest rates are low, as they have been for many years now, the cost of borrowing is relatively cheap. This makes it more affordable for the U.S. to carry large amounts of debt.\n\n4. Global Reserve Currency: The U.S. dollar is the world's primary reserve currency. This means many countries hold U.S. debt as a safe investment, reducing the risk of a sudden lack of lending or a sharp increase in interest rates.\n\n5. Demand for U.S. Treasuries: U.S. Treasury bonds, which represent most of the national debt, are seen as one of the safest investments in the world. This strong demand helps keep borrowing costs low.",
                "There's two ways to deal with the debt. Republicans want to eliminate all government support to the citizens - social security, medicare, medicaid, SNAP, ACA, DOJ, USPS and rely on the kindness of corporations to provide replacements. Democrats want to solve the problem by repealing the Reagan taxscam and corporate welfare and stop the redistribution of income and wealth from the bottom 90% to the top 1%. Pre-Reagan, every year all segments of our society saw their real income and wealth grow with the middle's share growing faster than the 1%'s. What makes anyone think removing the things that caused the current distribution won't restore the one we had from 1930 to 1980?",
                "So long as we can sell all the treasuries we need to sell to cover the debt payments, we're golden. The only thing that seriously jeopardizes  that ability is elected Republicans. Get rid of them, and all is good. Allow them to continue in office and they will crash the World economy to push their plans to privatize all government services.",
                "We just need to get over it, just like the rest of the global economy, it doesn\u2019t really matter, none of the numbers really mean anything when you\u2019re the reserve currency holder and have the biggest military, the debt to gdp ratio, the internal debt, they\u2019re all irrelevant, the only thing that we should worry about is quality of life, it\u2019s not like there\u2019s an interplanetary bank we owe money to or something"

He considered their ideas and methods ineffective and divorced from the realities of class struggle and revolutionary change. Lenin's views on utopian socialists can be found in his works, particularly in his book \"State and Revolution\" and his essay \"A Protest by Russian Social-Democrats.\"\n\nLenin argued that utopian socialists, such as Fourier, Saint-Simon, and Owen, proposed idealistic visions of a future society without providing a concrete analysis of the existing class contradictions and the need for revolutionary action. He criticized their approach for not recognizing the necessity of a proletarian revolution to overthrow the existing capitalist system and establish a dictatorship of the proletariat.\n\nAccording to Lenin, utopian socialists focused on moral persuasion, philanthropy, and constructing ideal communities as a means to achieve their socialist goals. However, he believed that such methods were insufficient and merely reflected the interests and aspirations of a few isolated individuals or intellectuals rather than addressing the fundamental contradictions of capitalism.\n\nLenin contrasted the utopian socialists with scientific socialists, particularly Marxists. He argued that scientific socialists, following the principles of Marxism, aimed to understand and transform the objective economic and social conditions through class struggle and revolution. Lenin emphasized the importance of organizing the working class, building a revolutionary party, and seizing state power as the path towards achieving socialism.\n\nIn summary, Lenin viewed utopian socialists as well-intentioned but misguided idealists who failed to provide a comprehensive analysis of class struggle and the necessary revolutionary methods for achieving socialism. He argued for a more practical and politically engaged approach, guided by scientific socialism and class-consciousness.",

                "FSOs have struggled to buy houses the entire time I've been in the service, now is certainly not an exception.  On one hand this career affords opportunities to save money if you so choose, on the other hand the only place you can reasonably plan on buying a house and living in it while still being employed is in the DMV, which has one of the most expensive housing markets in the country.  Also, while I would never say the pay is \"bad\" as an FSO, it is a lifestyle that makes it difficult to have a two income household.  In the DMV you're competing against families of two GS-13s for limited houses and losing.  I like taking annual vacations, eat meat almost every day, indulge personal hobbies a little more than I should, and I'm not a tandem, so I don't expect to ever afford a house within commuting distance of the Department.",

There is a total dearth of 03 / 02 officers in DC so you get a huge workload. It hugely benefits the department and doesn't give you much.  I definitely will not come back.",
                "From a relatively new FSO (joined this year), the current economic situation seems to be affecting my family less than most of my friends & extended  family. I took a slight pay cut to join, my partners income got cut roughly in half due to moving to DC, but the move allowed us to: \n- get rid of housing expenses entirely (saving us ~$2.5k per month)\n- go down to only one car (saving us ~$1k per month between payment & insurance)\n- decrease our monthly gas mileage to a fraction of what it was (saving us at least $500 a month - we both drove 30 miles each way to work)\n\nEveryone\u2019s situation is different obviously, but for us we feel privileged to be somewhat insulated from rampant inflation, due to not being involved in the housing market (buying or renting) & barely ever needing gas. We moved from a LCOL area within the States to what I think is one of the more expensive metros in the country (DC) and feel just fine. \n\nPlus, our onward assignment has a very low cost of living if you\u2019re receiving American salaries/currency so we know we\u2019ll enjoy a better quality of life in that way abroad. \n\nThat being said, I would not do a DC post because housing is outrageous here & the PCS housing program is a HUGE perk at the beginning. Plan on avoiding that for as long as possible.",
                "I would gather the answer is going to be a little bit of a 'Tale of Two Cities' response, depending on who is assigned domestically vs abroad.  \n\nFolks assigned abroad just about everywhere get free housing, utilities, and COLA if warranted.  This creates a fairly insulating experience.\n\nFolks living in D.C. likely feel it way more just like any other American, especially those that have newly arrived from an extended period abroad.",
                "There was once a plan to buy something like the Oakwood or similar building and turn it into FSO housing.  The concept was you could put in for an apartment if you're returning from overseas. The rent would be fixed at far below the market rate. You could be in the apartment for that first tour back (2 years). Space permitting you could do more, but the idea was it would lessen the financial shock/burden of coming back to the US and starting all over again.  In many cases, an FSO could do a DC tour and then go right back out, not having to worry about the insane costs associated with moving to DC at all.  It also gave you more time to find suitable permanent housing.  \n\nI believe that idea is long gone, but who knows, I haven't had a DC assignment since 2014 and I'll retire before I go back there again.",

                "Well, you got your answer about doing a domestic DC tour. \n\nBut for tours abroad, most people do just fine. Many FSOs have good salaries in relation to the local economy and many costs are covered by the department (i.e. rent). Heck, about a year ago, the USD and Euro reached parity, so even those FSOs in the Eurozone had about 10-15% more spending power than normal. \n\nPeople will still have their gripes about pay abroad, but generally speaking, the financial life is pretty good (assuming someone has a reasonable amount of financial discipline and common sense..... some FSOs still manage to bury themselves in debt)",

No coups (so long as you're polite to the military) or even assassination attempts (up until reelection time). Full women's rights achieved, despite it being very expensive, as well as Bludish reconciliation/Bludish dream (will get achievement).\n\nBasically, no significant compromises are necessary; folks will also be calling you a hardcore Malenyevist if you're into that.

From inputs to actual products.\n2. Import ban. Import quota. Agri tariffs.\n3. No economy of scale.\n4. Small landmass of the country. Agri land is competing with real estate.

Both scenarios are possible, but I feel the fed and domestic policy seems to be heading to the 'soft landing' that has been touted.\n\nEven if it does end up in a recession, it might just be slight over-adjustment on the fed's part and they can act to hone in that dial.\n\nThese crazy markets have me spooked a bit, as why are we approaching All Time Highs again?

                "Seriously need to stop breeding stupidity and bad fiscal ideas around for your own personal gain. This is how countries die, with populist wackos spreading misinformation and ignorance about complex fiscal and monetary sciences for their own political gain. \n\nIt's what caused Brexit. Its what caused Trussonomics and the resulting KamiKwazi implosion and you are contributing to it yet again. \n\nThe consolidated fund is simply the Government's bank account with the Bank of England. \nIt's not limitless. It's the place where all the tax revenue is collected plus any other extra government receipts (like if some other country pays us or whatever). The CF is then used to pay for things, serrated into: Supply Services eg. Govt departments Standing services eg. Elections, the judiciary, and public salaries, the Contingencies fund and the NLF. \n\nThe NLF is the National Loan Fund, again like another account in the BofE, which issues out bonds for the markets to buy, the revenue if which is accounted for in the NLF. The NLF the pays the money into the CF to fill the gaps between tax revenue in and govt spending. \nThe CF though must balance payments out, by covering the cost of interest on the bonds, by paying money into the NLF.  Basically the NLF is accounted separately, and allows for a clearer view of Govt borrowing, while the CF is just the account that tax money is paid into. \n\nIt is, therefore not infinite you half wit. \n\nNow the BofE could purchase Govt bonds as a way of reducing bond supply, making each bond more valuable and thereby driving down Govt interest payments, while making it easier to borrow. That's Quantative Easing basically. But the problem is that it is, by nature inflationary, and should be only used in a low growth, low inflation period. \n\nThe BofE could print more money to cover higher spending. But that leads to hyperinflation, as more money chases around the same number of goods and services as the years before. \n\nNow you might wonder, how does the BofE have money in the first place? \nThe BofE, makes money in 3 main ways: \n1) Printing money. It costs them pennies to print the notes, but banks pay them the face value of the note. Banks also pay them to protect the financial system and set interest rates. \n2) Financial companies pay a fee that covers the cost of regulating financial activities. Like the GMC with Doctors basically.\n3) As the world's oldest central bank, they have accumulated many assets over the years, which still generate revenue today. \n\nAll the profit from printing notes is sent to the Treasury (the CF), and depending on the Capital buffer and whether it is over their ceiling or below it, the rest is either kept to fill the capital buffer, or given to the Treasury, if above. \nGenerally they generate \u00a3250 million/ year from banknotes and about \u00a3100 million/ year for everything else. \n\nI apologise for my rudeness earlier but such wanton ignorance and politicising a complex and nuanced topic simply to kick a poltical can in a bloody echo chamber infuriates me.",

            "selftext": "When Mylan closed in Morgantown, it felt like the state went through hell and high water to bring jobs back to Morgantown. WVU ended up purchasing that facility and it appears to either have been sold or leased to other entities, at least partially.\n\nNow with hundreds of higher education jobs being cut in Morgantown, will the state step in again to work to save these jobs? Not only will this limit folks who have advanced degrees within WV but think of the economic impacts in northern WV. Morgantown is a booming economic engine in the state, but with the cuts, hundreds of people & families will move on, and thousands fewer students will be in Morgantown.\n\nNot even mentioning cutting degrees and programs that bring in millions in federal grant dollars throughout the state. Is the state government noticing? Do they see the impact to the state the cost cutting at WVU will create? Or will they just let it happen?\n\n\nFor those who don\u2019t know, WVU is slashing entire departments and merging colleges. So far advanced math degrees, M Legal Studies, MA public administration, and the entire foreign language department have been completely cut. Several colleges have already been announced to be combined and dozens of other degrees have been officially cut. Official announcement of all majors to be cut is supposed to happen on Monday.\n\nEdit: of course part of this issue is budget cuts in the state legislature but is this the wake up call they need?\n\nEdit 2: This is a larger state-wide issue. AB closing and other small colleges closing across the state. The economic impact of even these small colleges is extreme in some of these towns, like Philippi. \n\nWVU won\u2019t close its doors anytime soon but it seems it may be reduced to such a degree that it may even impact sports in the upcoming decades, I wonder the next realignment if we would need to drop conferences due to academics. I\u2019m not so much concerned with WVU as an institution but instead to the service it provides communities across the state and offers diverse education opportunities to WV residents. It\u2019s a broad topic and not as simple as a restructuring. There are real economic and humanitarian issues that may arise due to the shrinking or loss of some of these programs. And other colleges in the state\n\nEdit 3: thanks for the friendly discourse everyone!  It\u2019s interesting to hear everyone\u2019s takes and thoughts. Much appreciated",

Putin\u2019s top cheerleaders in state media lashed out at the country\u2019s financial authorities on Thursday over an exchange rate that he said was a subject of global mockery.\n> \n> The Russian central bank took measures on Thursday to stabilize the currency, amid the latest squall of financial volatility unleashed by Mr. Putin\u2019s war against Ukraine. This time, the challenges are seen in both a struggling ruble that is fueling inflation, but also in government budget deficits that raise concerns about the sustainability of Russia\u2019s intense spending on the war.\n> \n> The weakening ruble neared an exchange rate of 100 per U.S. dollar earlier this week, down by roughly 25 percent since the start of the year. The decline prompted the Bank of Russia on Thursday to halt purchases of foreign currency for the remainder of the year \u201cto reduce volatility.\u201d\n> \n> The central bank\u2019s move should help shore up the ruble, because when the bank spends rubles to buy foreign currency, it increases the supply of rubles in circulation, lowering their value. The ruble was roughly flat in trading on Thursday.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n> \n> But the events demonstrate how Russia\u2019s dramatically changing economy is challenging Moscow\u2019s financial policymakers, who have nimbly reacted to wartime shocks but still face longer-term dilemmas. Yawning deficits, coupled with exports that are increasingly crimped by sanctions, have disrupted Russia\u2019s economic equilibrium.\n> \n> The central bank has forecast inflation between 5 and 6.5 percent this year. Official data released on Wednesday showed the annual rate of inflation accelerating to 4.3 percent in July.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n> \n> Image\n> \n> \n> \n> \n> \n> Customers at a former McDonald\u2019s outlet in Moscow in June.

The ruble plummeted from 76 per dollar a week before the invasion to as low as 135 the following month. The central bank took a series of dramatic measures, including strictly limiting the flow of money out of the country, to stave off a full-blown meltdown.\n> \n> Then, the situation changed. A spike in oil prices, in part because of the conflict, helped raise Russian export revenue, just as imports fell on account of skittish Russian consumers, retreating foreign companies and other factors. The result was a record trade surplus of $221 billion in 2022, up 86 percent from the previous year. The ruble did a U-turn and soared to a seven-year high.\n> \n> But this year, Russia\u2019s trade surplus has shrunk significantly. Imports have recovered as Russian consumers return to buying and the government plows billions into the military-industrial complex to fund the war, with many goods still requiring imported materials.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n> \n> Image\n> \n> \n> \n> \n> \n> A destroyed Russian tank in the village of Novodarlivka, Ukraine, last month.

Political uncertainty, including an aborted mutiny in June by the mercenary tycoon Yevgeny V. Prigozhin has prompted Russians to move money into foreign accounts.\n> \n> \n> \n> As a result the ruble has been battered, losing nearly half its value since the highs of last year.\n> \n> The central bank\u2019s move Thursday marked the second time since the start of the war that Russia has been forced to abandon a policy of regularly buying and selling foreign currency to insulate the country\u2019s energy-dependent economy against oil price fluctuations.\n> \n> Vladimir Solovyov, a talk-show host on state television and a champion of the Kremlin, raged about the weakening ruble on his Thursday show, demanding the central bank explain \u201cwhy the hell the rate is jumping like that, so that everyone abroad is laughing.\u201d\n> \n> He also addressed the country\u2019s lawmakers. \u201cHave you not noticed the exchange rate we have in the country? Have you sent even one request to the central bank? So these people come and explain to people what is going on?\u201d\n> \n> The most immediate concern for Russian financial policymakers is the possibility of significantly higher consumer prices. The country\u2019s central bank [reacted](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/21/world/europe/russia-interest-rate-inflation.html) to that risk late last month with a higher-than-expected rise in interest rates, to 8.5 percent, and more increases could be on the way.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n> \n> Mr. Solovyov warned on his show that the inflation rate could peak during Mr. Putin\u2019s re-election campaign, ahead of a vote scheduled next March.\n> \n> Russia will report its latest gross domestic product figures on Friday. Officials have touted the country\u2019s growth outlook, but analysts point out that much of the economic output is being driven by state spending on the war effort. That spending helps drive inflation, and reducing it could cause an economic slowdown.\n> \n> \u201cThey are ballooning the economy with state demand,\u201d Ms. Prokopenko said. \u201cIt\u2019s a pure sugar injection for the economy, so once it stops, I would say it will be a great shock for the economy.\u201d\n> \n> The cheaper ruble in the short term will help the government finance its vast war expenditures, which last year caused the second-highest deficit since the breakup of the Soviet Union.

                "Honestly the most important thing China's leadership ever did was to make long term investments they knew they would never live to see. China didn't just magically become the giant it is today -- it took decades.\n\nWe have strong leaders in Africa but they would rather invest in vanity projects instead of long term economic projects. Abiy Ahmed decided to spend 10 billion dollars on a presidential palace which was not needed at all.\n\nI realize that China has massive government buildings as well but they are a small percentage of total government spending.",
                "China's key to success is due to many things:\n\n* Its population structure meant it could sustain a low long run average variable cost of labour, which is essential for developing a manufacturing base.\n* far reaching reforms. China's reform of its economy was the largest legal reforms by any country or state in history. Between 2000 and 2010, China reformed more that 5 million laws and trade regulation.\n* Taking advantage of the great unbundling. Advances in technology and logistics meant that making everything yourself was inefficient. For once, you didn't have to manufacture something, but you could assemble everything. For example, while ipads were made in China, only 8% of its components were made there. China added value by providing the services.\n* The services side is where African countries stumble. With things like the African Free Trade area, the focus has always been lowering tariffs. Tariffs works well with goods , but not services. A good example is opening up tourism industry across Africa , but not allowing airlines from other countries to access those markets. China did that very well.\n* Controversial take. Someone once said 'freedom of speech will not feed your children'. Most countries that developed economically did not do so in a democratic manner, no manner what the west tells you.\n* China focused its anti democratic tendencies by forcing through reforms which would have been impossible in a democracy. They also directed corruption into a productive force. If you steal state money, build a factory with it. Our corrupt leaders buy luxury goods from their stolen funds. The Chinese, Koreans, Singaporeans, Indonesians reinvests those stolen funds. False Economies is a great book if you have the chance to read it.\n* Education and health. China's government spent more on education and health in the last 20 years than anyone in history. The money they generated from increasing trade was spent in improving their human capital. Improving their human capital meant they could improve from being a cheap labour economy to a capital intensive economy in a very short time.\n* Use the international system in their favour. China's joining the WTO in 2001 was pivotal. rather than asking for a exemption for being a developing economy, they took all the measures head on. China immediately raised 25 complaints against the EU, Australia, the US and Japan for shady trade practices , which they won. China's development after WTO accession his nothing short of incredible. African countries should band up at the WTO and force through our own agenda.\n\nMy two cents anyway :)",

                "Africa and China are obviously different. China has been a nation state for thousands of years. While African countries are mostly colonial constructs, which has contributed to a lot of issues. However, there is still a lot that African countries can learn from China's development:\n\n* Invest in infrastructure. China probably has the best public infrastructure in the world. African countries can replicate this by first investing in electricity \u2014 the foundation of industry. Once that is sorted, other infrastructure can then be focused on such as transport, water, etc.\n* Have the government save a lot by accumulating foreign exchange reserves. This will weaken the currency, make exports more competitive and lead to a current account surplus. It is a trade strategy used across East Asia. This also reduces the risk of government debt, as it has some collateral to fall back on. \n* Focus on manufacturing for exports and be ok with very low wages in manufacturing. Exporting manufactured goods is really hard, since countries would be competing with the entire world. So, to be competitive, countries would have to have low wages in relatively low capital industries like textiles. But this only a start, over time countries can move up the value chain which will be higher paying. China \u2014 which once focused more on clothes \u2014 is now the world's biggest car exporter.\n* Invest in education. Starting with the very basics such as making sure that everyone can read and write. \n* Policies to reduce fertility. The idea is that smaller families will be able to save more, providing the capital to invest in infrastructure. China's \"One child policy\" was way too extreme and is now paying for it with a declining population. India's [approach](https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/blexplainer/what-the-fertility-rate-decline-means-for-india/article37996061.ece) is more balanced and sustainable, which was obtained by investing in health and education.\n* Protect property rights. China is interesting as it is a historically communist state with limited individual property rights. However, individual rights were respected such as the numerous of examples of \"[nail houses](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/gallery/2014/apr/15/china-nail-houses-in-pictures-property-development)\" \u2014 which is individuals refusing to move for a development. And China has recently reformed the law to further protect individual property rights.\n* Focus on a more federal model allowing a lot of local autonomy and experimentation. So much of China's development was the central government allowing coastal provinces, local governments and special economic zones to do their own thing. You don't have to be a big country to have a more federal political model, look at Switzerland.",

                "China is basically 3-4 states in 1. Coastal China 30 years ago was relatively pretty developed in certain coastal cities. Not fair to compare Shanghai to Hargeisa, Asmara or Lilongwe even if it wasn't a world class city back them. Way more populous too so any gains in education scaled exponentially vs Africa which was and still underpopulated and many African states having very marginal post secondary technical training/university education. Many states legitimately only had a dozen at best and a handful at worst. In Italian Eritrea, education was capped at grade 4 which was an obvious policy aimed at making sure Africans could not compete in the job market on equal footing. I do believe Namibia under South African ownership during Apartheid capped Black education to grade 6 in eigthies.\n\nChina also had bunch of western companies ship their manufacturing abroad to them.",

Japan's companies invested in China decades before the West did. East Asia has immense regional trade, which started with reindustrialized Japan investing in its former colonies/occupied territories in Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong, & Singapore. Then once all five got richer and needed cheap labor they invested in China, Indonesia, Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand. Now that those countries are richer they are all investing in the last frontier of poor asian nations Laos, Cambodia, Myanmar, and Vietnam, with Vietnam already surpassing Philippines.\n\nAfrica just needs its first Japan. Just like how Japan's Mitsubishis, Sony, and Hitachi invested to make joint ventures in cheap labor countries close to home, Africa needs its first Industrialized power with its own clothing, electronics, & steel firms to invest in another African country.

That we've somehow just never been lucky enough to have good economists?\n\nI think global economics are zero-sum. China gutted the US' manufacturing base to get where they are, and there's nothing the US could do about it because you can't have a \"strong\" currency and build an export-based economy (like China's) at the same time.\n\nSo, who is Africa gonna gut?

            "title": "First-quarter economic growth was actually 2%, up from 1.3% first reported in major GDP revision",
            "selftext": "The U.S. economy showed much stronger-than-expected growth in the first quarter than previously thought, according to a big upward revision Thursday from the Commerce Department.\n\nGross domestic product increased at a 2% annualized pace for the January-through-March period, up from the previous estimate of 1.3% and ahead of the 1.4% Dow Jones consensus forecast. This was the third and final estimate for Q1 GDP. The growth rate was 2.6% in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe upward revision helps undercut widespread expectations that the U.S. is heading toward a recession.\n\nAccording to a summary from the department\u2019s Bureau of Economic Analysis, the change came in large part because both consumer expenditures and exports were stronger than previously thought.\n\nConsumer spending, as gauged by personal consumption expenditures, rose 4.2%, the highest quarterly pace since the second quarter of 2021. At the same time, exports rose 7.8% after falling 3.7% in the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\nAn 8.7% boost in the Social Security cost-of-living adjustment likely boosted the consumer spending numbers, said Scott Hoyt, senior director at Moody\u2019s Analytics.\n\n\u201cOverall, however, the economy remains admirably resilient, and odds of a recession beginning this year are receding. But the coast is far from clear,\u201d he said.\n\nThere also was some good news on the inflation front.\n\nCore PCE prices, which exclude food and energy, rose 4.9% in the period, a downward revision of 0.1 percentage point. The all-times price index increased 3.8%, unchanged from the last estimate.\n\nFederal Reserve policymakers most closely watch core PCE as an inflation indicator. Through a series of rate increases, the Fed is trying to get inflation back down to 2%.\n\nThe rate hikes are targeted at slowing down an economy that in the summer of 2022 was generating inflation at the highest level since the early 1980s.\n\nOne specific focus for the Fed has been the labor market. There currently are about 1.7 open positions for every available worker, and the tightness has resulted in a push higher for wages which generally have not kept pace with inflation.\n\n\u201cObviously, while the baseline forecast calls for the economy to skirt recession, risks are extremely high. It would take little to push the economy into recession,\u201d Hoyt said.\n\nA separate report Thursday from the Labor Department pointed showed that initial jobless claims fell to 239,000 for the week ended June 24. That was a decline of 26,000 from the previous week and well below the estimate for 264,000.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/29/first-quarter-economic-growth-was-actually-2percent-up-from-1point3percent-first-reported-in-major-gdp-revision.html",

                "I'm not surprised. I've been posting about that Q1 print that it was much better than it looked--there were huge inventory effects that brought down the figure despite otherwise strong components from consumer spending.\n\n[My comment from April 28th](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/132c0fs/53_of_the_sp_500_companies_have_reported_and_so/ji4aja6/) explaining this (using the old data at the time).\n\n> ## GDP Report + PCE Data:\n> \n> - *GDP did slow down* from its **2.6% growth** in **Q4** to **1.1%**.\n> - However, if you decompose it, we saw strong **consumer spending of +3.7%**. \"That was the fastest pace since the second quarter of 2021 and up from **1% in the prior quarter**, the department said\" (WSJ). *People are spending more.*\n> - It was investment falling + inventories that really killed the print. And it *really* did: \n> - \"The growth in inventories shrank by a whopping $138 billion, the sharpest reversal in two years. **Had inventory levels remained neutral**, GDP would have expanded at a frothy **3.4% rate in the first quarter**.\" Inventory draw-downs eventually get reversed when demand picks up again.\n> - \"**Real disposable personal income increased 8.0** percent in the first quarter, compared with an increase of 5.0 percent in the fourth.\" *People are earning more*.\n> - \"The **personal saving rate** [...] as percentage of disposable personal income\u2014was **4.8 percent** in the first quarter, compared with 4.0 percent in the fourth.\" *People are also saving more.*\n> \n> So people earned 8% more QoQ (real income), saved more (4.0% --> 4.8%), and spent more (+3.7% in  real terms). Consumers are holding up GDP and the economy. And this is why core inflation is so sticky! If it weren't for some inventory adjustments we would have seen a very strong GDP print.\n> \n> Find more [data here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/130fbuf/rstocks_daily_discussion_options_trading_thursday/jhz9u4a/) about yesterday's economic reports, and also [discussion of consumer balance sheets here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/131mp0t/rstocks_daily_discussion_fundamentals_friday_apr/ji3mdn5/).

Karl Marx 1845](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01b.htm)\n\n> The ideas of the ruling class are in every epoch the ruling ideas, i.e. the class which is the ruling material force of society, is at the same time its ruling intellectual force. The class which has the means of material production at its disposal, has control at the same time over the means of mental production, so that thereby, generally speaking, the ideas of those who lack the means of mental production are subject to it. The ruling ideas are nothing more than the ideal expression of the dominant material relationships, the dominant material relationships grasped as ideas; hence of the relationships which make the one class the ruling one, therefore, the ideas of its dominance. The individuals composing the ruling class possess among other things consciousness, and therefore think. Insofar, therefore, as they rule as a class and determine the extent and compass of an epoch, it is self-evident that they do this in its whole range, hence among other things rule also as thinkers, as producers of ideas, and regulate the production and distribution of the ideas of their age: thus their ideas are the ruling ideas of the epoch. For instance, in an age and in a country where royal power, aristocracy, and bourgeoisie are contending for mastery and where, therefore, mastery is shared, the doctrine of the separation of powers proves to be the dominant idea and is expressed as an \u201ceternal law.\u201d",

                "This sounds like they've done something seriously wrong. There are *tons* of correlates of low discount rates, financial knowledge, poor personal finance decisions, credit card use etc with SES inputs like IQ or personality and outcomes like income/wealth; claiming there is *zero* correlation and poor/rich are equal, is extremely surprising and suggests there is some sort of selection effect or measurement artifact or data quality/quantity problem erasing these pervasive correlations.\n\n> ...To test this, we assessed rates of ten cognitive biases across nearly 5000 participants from 27 countries. Our analyses were primarily focused on 1458 individuals that were either low-income adults or individuals who grew up in disadvantaged households but had above-average financial well-being as adults, known as positive deviants.\n\nLooking through this study (which it sounds like no one else here has done, even though you can see it's published in the bad _Nature_ and not a good econ/psych journal), I see a lot of psychometric problems for a study which is almost entirely about individual-differences psychology & psychometric measurements: specifically, almost every datapoint is poorly measured, and every time that happens, measured correlations must shrink further to zero. Oddly enough, 'zero' is also what they find...\n\nSpecifically for example, they find that there's minimal correlation between the cognitive biases (which is wrong and means that they have bad measurements if they can't see a factor or index), they report a low percentage of biases per individual (so a floor effect), dichotomize cognitive biases including continuous variables like temporal discounting rates (massive loss of statistical power, everyone knows you aren't supposed to dichotomize variables which aren't actually binary - because what does it mean to dichotomize discount rates...?), despite their claim to be 'well powered' they present no power analyses showing that their analysis even could find plausible-sized effects with such small samples in the presence of all of these measurement problems, effect sizes will be weakened by standard economics issues like self-report of income being inaccurate compared to administrative data & their low median age of 38 (so many of the wealth differences are still compounding\\*), and I'm not sure about this 'positive deviant' sample methodology in the first place as it seems vulnerable to a lot of issues like trying to predict noise (how many of those deviants are 'genuinely' wealthy as opposed to experiencing transient wealth shocks & they will regress back to their mean?). Naturally, they do not explain why they are right and all the other studies are wrong, mostly handwaving (and citing, incidentally, [unreplicable scarcity experiments](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2103313118)). There's not a latent variable, SEM, or correction for measurement error in sight. No wonder they can only turn in a null, I'd wonder if they could see the sun at noon with a dataset like this.\n\nColor me unimpressed and not revising any of my views about the role of individual differences in lifelong economic outcomes...\n\n\\* eg. a doctor at age 38 may be just a few years out of residency and still paying off loans, and be much poorer than if you check back in another decade or two; similarly if you're self-employed, or working in a civil service with backloaded pensions etc.",

If the sum of your individual choices adds up to being poor you will remain poor.  I know because... Was poor and was amazed at how lost I was on how the world worked once I changed my surroundings.\n\nFundamentally, a poor person does not understand WHY they are poor and others are wealthy.  A person can be poor and do everything \"right\" per their understanding of fiscal responsibility. Get to work on time, pay my bills, and stay out of trouble. Unfortunately, that is a recipe to survive not thrive.  Their understanding rarely covers investments in acquiring high paying in demand skills, business equity, stocks, or real estate.  They are 100% dependent on their employer and the state to make long term plans for them.  Two parties that are not particularly motivated to even plan or let alone plan well. Also, poor people don't understand the interrelationship between education, social verification (degrees, certifications), and wealth. Many are prematurely hobbled by lack of parental support and personal investment in the process due to not being capable of envisioning themselves beyond their current state.  If your parents haven't poured into you by the time you are 11, you are far behind the curve. If you don't \"believe in and commit to the process\" ages 11-18 and 18-22, you will be fighting an uphill battle.\n\nPoor people go through their entire life paying for cable, cars, credit cards, etc... and being penalized when they miss a payment. That means that these same people could invest $25-200 a month in a broad ETF that would put them in control of their lives within a decade.  They don't because rather than providing them the knowledge and an easily executable plan, their \"allies\" given them platitudes and government \"help\" which penalizes them for making good decisions (staying married) or slowly rising out of poverty (stopped/decreased helpful benefits).\n\nPoverty culture, in an American context, is a constant state of constrained aspiration that explains the short term splurging which often undermines poor people.

We council all the kids we talk to that they always need a way to make a living in case of a downturn in aviation.  You got that covered with your IT skills.\n\nYou have money saved.  If I were you with your skills and desires, I would either purchase a plane, purchase a plane with a partner, or get into a good flying club.  Do your training through CFI locally.  It's far cheaper than one of the training mills.  Owning even part of an aircraft will teach you about aircraft systems.  Learn to do oil changes, participate in your annuals and you will be head and shoulders above the other people applying for the same job, whatever it is.  Maybe get your A&P.\n\nGood luck.",

                "A few thoughts.\n\n1). What are your feelings about flying professionally vs. Flying as a hobby? \n\n If you choose to fly professionally, understand the day will come that it is just work.  You may come to feel about flying how you currently feel about your current line of work.\n\nIf you come to dislike flying (and believe me, airline management will do its damnest to get you to that point), will you still believe the jump to have been worth it?\n\nIf you chose to get a sport pilot license or private license, would you be able to get what you want, emotionally, out of flying as a hobby?\n\nMore personally, you may need to consider what you seek out of work.  You may be looking for way more than a paycheck out of what you do.  I would caution against that. I fly airbuses for a large yellow airline.  I love my job.  I love my paycheck.  I worked hard and paid my dues.  But believe me, I will not hesitate to pop smoke and bail if it makes sense financially.\n\nI work for money.  Enjoying my work is a plus but not necessary.  I have a family that needs my earning potential.  I have limited time on this earth and I am going to spend it building wealth, not encumbered by debt.  My grandchildren will, God willing, be blessed by me making the most of my opportunities.  \n\n2).  I strongly advise you seriously look into the financials of such a transition.  You are currently making a decent income.  Making this jump will torpedo you earning for several years.  You will be encumbered by a large debt which will drag down the higher earnings you *might* make later.\n\nAre you familiar with using discounted cash flow method to evaluate two choices for their future earnings?  You need to do this.  I can show you how if you want.\n\nMy gut tells me this is a bad idea for you.  You need to compare flying to the alternative of staying in your current industry making what you currently make.  If you make the jump, incur the debt, then experience a setback, you can easily be so far behind that you will never make back what you lost by coming.\n\nThe airlines have been hiring like gangbusters for a few years now.  They will continue for a few tears more.  Most people in this category are early to late 30s.  This means by the time you could even show up, you will be junior to a very young pilot population.  You will experience a very stagnant career.  Evaluate this career QOL and earnings as a long term FO (If you want qol) or a junior reserve captain (if you want money)."

                "What do you mean by \u2018the current dynamics of the food industry quite literally provides the foundation for energy that humans need to exist?\u2019\n\nThis is a premise that maybe isn\u2019t too clear - or if it\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking - or too relevant. Are you just saying humans get their energy from food? The obvious answer being, well we\u2019d keep getting our food and energy from plants. We\u2019d replace the smaller portion of calories and protein and other nutrition (even meat eaters get around 2/3s of their protein from plants), with more plant. \n\nLikewise we could do so with far more efficiency. Animal agriculture uses 80% of land, and accounts for less than 20% of global calories. The 80/20 rule pops up a lot in animal agriculture. In short, we use 46% of all habitable earth for farming. 3/4s of that is for animal agriculture. By comparison, we use 1% of habitable land for all human infrastructure (roads, towns, villages, cities, etc.). If we all go vegan, we save I think it was 35x of all habitable land. Far more space for energy - whether growing food or producing more sustainable energy (wind, solar, etc)\n\nIt is very arguable that being vegan would free up *many times* more space and area for economic development. It\u2019d be cheaper and healthier (on average) and would thus free up capital and labour to more activity. \n\n(ask for links if you want the source, it\u2019s the usual stuff here so quotes all the time).",
                ">how could we do such a thing without creating economic problems? \n\nDo you see the irony of asking that while the world's economy is in danger of collapse, and the only way to keep it going is by burning the ecosystem we need to survive...? \n\nThere are always economic problems, but most are fixable, Capitalism and the entire current system of ecological suicide is not. \n\n>To change it in a way that is vegan friendly, supports life, provides livelihoods for the food industry workers as well as others, and maintains economic growth, what can we do? \n\nOne option is Veggie Farming in a sustainable, which means labour intensive, way. AI and automation is already looking to wipe out a very large percentage of our jobs, a return to a farming society makes absolute sense, What else are we going to have people do? Sit around and watch youtube sucking down sugary fat, and baitin'? I know lots of people that would love to but there's no money in it as all the subsidies and focus is on the massive factory farms and the meat/dairy industry. \n\nThe current system of life is ending, either through a well planned change if we're smart, of through climate change if we're not. \n\n> so let us read what you have as a solution to stated problem.\n\nThe actual solutions wont be created by some random person on Reddit, it will be created by experts in the fields required, but there is no problem in a Vegan world that doesn't already exist in the Carnist world, there's just a lot fewer animals suffering.",

A vegan roadmap doesn\u2019t have to be different than the discontinuation of certain fuels.\n\nFor instance, if governments would stop subsidizing animal farming and animal-feed, that money can go to renovating their infrastructure to use it for other sectors, or re-training of the workforce to human-feed agriculture or processing of lab-grown meat.",

No, the free market system adjusts itself.\n\n2) for essentially all systems, the economic situation would improve\u2026. \nLower medical bills from having a healthier population. \nAlso lower medical bills from slaughterhouse workers experiencing injuries. \nChicken and pig farmers escaping the constant debt cycle that accrues from working under big ag. \nCountries being able to keep their own grain to feed their citizens instead of shipping it to westernized countries for livestock feed. \n\n\nAll told, the current system of animal ag is so inefficient\u2026.

Graduated my +2 in Science with 75.4% on aggregate at 2072, really loved Physics, Mathematics, some of the Physical Chemistry (yes organic and inorganic chemistry sucked, for me at least). And trust me, I achieved it without studying at home, entirely based on Teacher's teaching at school.\n\nDuring my +2 days, I assuming, my father would definitely talk about me with his friends and his colleagues about what would be better. And then they probably would tell him about how their or cousin's son or neighbour's son joined engineering and how much he is earning because of that. That would raise the hopes of my father and he would come home and talk to me about how his colleague's cousin's son, who I don't know, I don't even know the colleague,  who was also fairly talented joined engineering and today's he is earning really well.\n\nAlong with that, almost everybody I was friends with in +2, were planning to join IOE, IOM wasn't an option because we were of Mathematics section. I followed my friends, went to Kathmandu, joined PEA and started preparation for Entrance. If scored decently, Civil Engineering, I never had any ambition for, I wanted to join Electronics and Communication or Computer, if got a chance. While everybody, including my father, who heard it from somebody else, said Nepal is a developing nation, it will be needing Civil Engineering here and there. It is going to have a lot of scope. Choose Civil, I'd just say okay and dismiss the talk.\n\nBy god's grace, I ranked 295th in IOE Entrance, 2072. I was excited at a chance to get to study at Pulchowk Campus because Pulchowk had 432 seats then. I filled out a form to get into the admission list, and my priorities were 1. Computer Regular, 2. Computer Full Fee, 3. Electronics and Communications Regular 4. Mechanical Regular. Admission list was out and my name was nowhere to be found. I had heard somewhere but not certainly, that there would be multiple admission where you'd have to reapply after 3rd or 4th admission list is out and the position is still vacant. which I found to be true a little later.\n\nAnyways, I got a little scared, because as far as I know, it couldn't be true, I called my dad and stated my name wasn't on the admission list of pulchowk may be if we waited, we could get a chance. He asked me what about other campuses ? I told him I hadn't applied in Thapathali Campus which was already closed but Paschimanchal and Purwanchal were still open. He asked me to apply to Purwanchal Campus which was close to home (Biratnagar) because if you're not going to get Pulchowk , why not prefer somewhere close to home. I applied to Purwanchal Campus on Civil Regular only because I was angry that I'd not be getting desired campus, Pulchowk, why should I get desired faculty, right ? The admission list was out, my name was on the top of the admission list, finalized the admission process. That's how I became the student of Purwanchal Campus of Civil faculty.\n\nBecause this was the first time tasting the government education, I quit going classes as well because let's face it, even if it happens, its productivity was almost none existent. The teachers except for a couple of two didn't mind as long as you attended their assessment exam. So, I'd study only on the 3-day gap of the exam, yet still managed to clear 1st and 2nd semester because they were just  a little advanced refresher of +2. except for drawing, which I cleared on back exam. From the 3rd semester on, core subjects started hitting that was when I figured engineering is not just Physics and Mathematics after all. But I didn't change my way of learning, still the 3-day option. This time on, I could manage to only clear mathematics based subjects like Engineering Mathematics III, probability and statistics, numerical methods, etc.\n\nAlmost every other subjects were in my backlogs. 5/7 subjects from 3rd semester, 6/7 subjects from 4th semester, 5/6 subjects from 5th semester, 6/7 subjects from 6th semester. I didn't attend any back exam to clear them out. I just didn't care. It was then realized, if I didn't graduate, I'd be wasting 4 years of my time for nothing. I still didn't go to classes but I bought books, old questions, manual solutions, and studied myself from there. On the 7th semester, I cleared 4/6 subjects that made me genuinely happy even after though it was civil engineering I was studying. I cleared the next 2 as well on the immediate back paper and some of the other like 1 or 2 odd semester's back along with it. On final semester (held on 2076 Ashoj), I degraded a little, I cleared 3/6 subjects. And on the immediate back paper, I cleared the next 3 and some other even semester's subjects. That way my 1st and 4th year was clear during the point of 4 years. But almost every subject were remaining of the other two semesters.\n\nThen the Covid hit, exams were pushed off, and I didn't study because I didn't know when they were going to be conducted. And then when they were conducted (around Poush 2077), regular exams of two semesters and back exam of one was conducted with 15 days gap between each other and that went disasterously. I cleared a few subjects, but not as I had hoped. Then again the second wave of covid, but it got let off a little early.\n\nFast forward now, when the even semester exam happened on Chaitra, I officially have spend 7 complete years (from the basis of exams conducted) on this Campus (7.5 years based on actual time). Almost everybody of my batch has already graduated. On the Chaitra of 2079, I had only 2 subjects of 4th semester remaining, ('soil mechanics' and 'hydraulics') of which I took exam of on 21st Chaitra and 12th Baisakh. Funny thing happened, I believed on 21st chaitra was the exam of Hydraulics and prepared for it up until two days before when my friend told me which subject it was. That exam went indecisively and in IOE exam, if a studnet is indecisive means fail. And during the actual exam of Hydraulics which on the 12th of Baisakh, on 6th Baisakh, I had an emergency surgery for appendicitis and got discharged on 10th of Baisakh. I took my exam any ways.\n\nThe result came out 3 days ago, my symbol number was not published. I don't know which subject I cleared or both remained uncleared, but I have to take exam once again somewhere between Dashain and Tiar. Because of this I haven't been able to hold any job. And now, I'm 25 years old with no degree, no job, no experience, financially, ecomonically and psychologically broken. At this point of time, where I should be supporting them, they're supporting me. I see the look on my father's face, it isn't as hopeful as it used to be. I just don't know how do I move forward. I don't see anything to look forward to in the future.",

                "My story is similar to yours, completed SLC at 2070. My grades were similar to yours as well. The difference was that I didn\u2019t want to prepare for Nepali education, so went India to study B.Tech CSIT. Was decent, but was underperforming in subjects that had nothing to do with computers. Studied 3 years, got sick multiple times, which eventually led me to drop out. Came back Nepal, same people who used to do wah-wahi of me began to talk shit behind my back.\n\nWhy am I telling you all this? Because at the end, there is always sunshine, came back, joined some foreign uni affiliated college, gave all exams even if i didn\u2019t attend classes. Began freelancing, now even if I earn less, it goes to lakh in a month.\n\nSometimes, life tests your perseverance, to see if you\u2019re really fit to reach where you want to reach.

                "This is a suggestion from a guy in his 40s. Don\u2019t get disturbed by the success of your peers and don\u2019t think you got behind. A couple of years is nothing. I think you should wait and complete your degree. It may take another year. Also don\u2019t hung up on not getting the subject you desired, you can get success and fulfillment regardless. Decades ago I also didn\u2019t get into pulchowk campus, my friends did. I got demoralized and opted for biology in Trichandra College as I couldn\u2019t afford private collleges. When I completed masters from kirtipur my peers were already earning and well into their careers. People thought they will find me teaching middle school in hinterland. I somehow got int PhD program, came to US in my thirties and only managed to get a job in industry in late thirties. Well life is more or less comfortable. Some of my friends back home are thinking to retire but I don\u2019t mind because I live my life and they live theirs.",

I graduated from IOE Pulchowk Campus, as a Civil Engineer (2071-2075), and I had six backlogs when our academic days were over. By hook or crook, I passed them all after six months. So, a genuine suggestion to you as an elder brother, who had the same experience as you, is that just focus on clearing your back exams and think of nothing else. Don't think about money, about family problems, about future studies, and so on. Right now all you need to do is bring your mind, body, thoughts, and energy towards the upcoming exam only. Trust me, this works, and I hope everything goes well for you, Inshaallah.",

Efficient utilization of your time allows you to achieve things, master things, create things, create wealth, enjoy life, help others, etc.\n\nLife in a way is a game of time.

But failing in many subjects during regular exams is something that happened due to your negligence and you gotta accept it yourself.\n\nMy advice to you would be to work hard for the remaining exams and also apply for jobs that will give you a boost in your career. I know it's easier said than done but if you were a top 300 among 18-20K students who gave IOE exams back then I think you got the talent but maybe the freedom you get during Bachelors got you distracted.\n\nAnyway I wish you all the best for your remaining exams.

You got into the trap of not studying and passing classes for so long that you didn't have discipline to properly study for the subject you\u2019re taking. It happened to me as well. I had to learn to be diligent, made friends that were studious outside of class and spent many hours in the library with them. Gone were the days when I would sleep in class and pass them. This particularly applies to fields like engineering, physics, CS. Etc. Anything that requires math and actual practice.\n\nIt took me close to 7 years to finish college here in the US. First years I decided to open up a restaurant so I was working 60+ hours. I didn't know what I wanted to major in and took gener education. Failed a class that though was not important( seriously,  fuck music appreciation and the old hag that was teaching it at 8 am only playing classical.) As I got into my junior year which took me 4 years to reach I lost my scholarship. Sold off restaurant and asked my parents to support me for a year. \n\nMid junior year decided to get checked out for ADHD, yep I have it. Got medication and then luckily scored an internship.

            "selftext": "This is the second part of my response to \u201cThe Dollar Endgame\u201d, a series of posts on Reddit\u2019s r/SuperStonk that attempts \u2014 quite badly \u2014 to tell the history of the global financial system and proclaim an impending financial crisis.\n\nPart 1 was economics focused and so lives on r/badeconomics, it can be viewed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/15hachb/strange_books_on_the_internet_distributing_words/).\n\nThis one is being posted here and there as it is somewhat at the intersection between the two subs.\n\nThis post is standalone, however, so no need to read the prior post unless you are interested.\n\nToday we are going to look at how Dollar Endgame misunderstands the origin of money, trade, and international finance. It is, in my opinion, almost entirely wrong.\n\n**III. History, Trade, and the Gold Standard**\n\nThe post, after introducing an extraordinarily overwrought quote about humanity being at an existential crossroads, begins by setting out the concept of money.\n\n*Money, in and of itself, might have actual value; it can be a shell, a metal coin, or a piece of paper. Its value depends on the importance that people place on it\u2014traditionally, money functions as a medium of exchange, a unit of measurement, and a storehouse for wealth (what is called the three factor definition of money). Money allows people to trade goods and services indirectly, it helps communicate the price of goods (prices written in dollar and cents correspond to a numerical amount in your possession, i.e. in your pocket, purse, or wallet), and it provides individuals with a way to store their wealth in the long-term.*\n\nThis is basically unobjectionable and I think basically correct. This is the traditional threefold account of what money is.^(1) One minor clarification I might make, as it will be important in follow up parts, is that the best mental model of money probably isn\u2019t a binary yes/no. Rather, things vary in their money-ness along different spectrums. In the modern day for example, cash is definitely money, but so are bank deposits and each has strengths and weakness. Cash is probably a better store of value (rarely is there a run on the mattress), but bank deposits are a better medium of exchange if you are trying to pay for your Disney Plus account.\n\nFrom here TDE makes an assertion about how and what types of money have been used historically, this is not as correct:\n\n*\\*Since the inception of world trade, merchants have attempted to use a single form of money for international settlement. In the 1500s-1700s, the Spanish silver peso (where we derive the $ sign) was the standard- by the 1800s and early 1900s, the British rose to prominence and the Pound (under a gold standard) became the de facto world reserve currency, helping to boost the UK\u2019s military and economic dominance over much of the world. After World War 1, geopolitical power started to shift to the US, and this was cemented in 1944 at Bretton Woods, where the US was designated as the WRC (World Reserve Currency) holder.*\n\nThere are several issues here.Let\u2019s start with the least important, which is that TDE may in fact be understating the linguistic influence of Spanish Pesos on the dollar. Pesos were referred to in the London market as dollars on the basis of their physical similarity to the Dutch Joachimsthaler (anglicized as Joachimsdollar).^(2) Furthermore, pesos circulated heavily in the colonial US and its a reasonable hypothesis that this explains the US selection of the term \u201cDollar\u201d.^(3)\n\nA more serious complaint here is that, although this isn\u2019t directly contradicted in the post, it is worth being clear that world trade began several thousands of years prior to the 1500s. And this is the real crux of my issue, because a great deal of trade between polities did not use a single form of money, particularly in that period.^(4) I think there are several ways of demonstrating this.\n\nFirst, consider the fact that many polities and empires never even settled on a single form of money internally. Take say the Roman Empire circa 300, the internally circulating currency was less a unified set of denominations and more a bevy of different coinages from different eras all composed of different values (both face and metallic content) made from different metals, ipso facto any trade Rome did with the world wasn\u2019t using a single currency.5\n\nIf that form of proof is insufficient, then consider the fact that, to the best of my very much remedial archeological knowledge, world trade actually predates the use of currency. I believe (but very much could be wrong) that the first coinage we have evidence of is electrum coins used in Greece \\~1000 BCE.\n\nHere is Barry Cunliffe\u2019s description of trade in the Late Epipaleothic period, thousands of years prior to that^(6):\n\n*\u201cWith a more settled form of economy and larger agglomerations of people living together in one place, social behaviour begins to develop greater complexity. Individuals display their identity through personal ornaments, which family groups or lineages carefully bury with their dead, usually within the settlement. There is also evidence for inter-community interaction in the form of traded commodities such as obsidian from central and eastern Anatolia and sea-shells from the Mediterranean and the Red Sea.\u201d*\n\nI find it hard to square barter-esque trade in commodities circa 10,000 BCE with the idea of a universal drive to singularize currency for trade. Of course, this actually makes sense. A lot of the benefits of currency alignment require the existence of capital markets and various institutions that would only arrive the the late medieval/early modern era.\n\nMy final disagreement with this point is that I think it gets the chronology of the US dollars dominance wrong. The above paragraph locates the Dollar\u2019s dominance as arriving with its designation as reserve currency in the post-WW2 Bretton Woods Agreement. In a sense this is accurate, but really the designation was a recognition of the dollars de facto dominance which was mostly complete by the time of WW1.Here is Barry Eichengreen on the rise of the dollar:\n\n*\u201cIncumbency is thought to be a powerful advantage in international currency competition. It is blithely asserted that another quarter of a century, until after World War II, had to pass before the dollar displaced sterling as the dominant international unit. But this supposed fact is not, in fact, a fact. From a standing start in 1914, the dollar had already overtaken sterling by 1925.\u201d Also, this somewhat elides over a distinction that will be important later, but whether a currency is the main currency held as foreign reserves by central banks and whether that currency is used to denominate trade are not, analytically, the same thing.\u201d*\n\nFollowing this brief summary of the history of money, the Dollar Endgame attempts to explicate in more detail the rise of the US dollar.\n\n*In the early fall of 1939, the world had watched in horror as the German blitzkrieg raced through Poland, and combined with a simultaneous Russian invasion, had conquered the entire territory in 35 days. This was no easy task, as the Polish army numbered more than 1,500,000 men, and was thought by military tacticians to be a tough adversary, even for the industrious German war machine. As WWII continued to heat up and country after country fell to the German onslaught, European countries, fretting over possible invasions of their countries and annexation of their gold, started sending massive amounts of their Gold Reserves to the US. At one point, the Federal Reserve held over 50% of all above-ground reserves in the world.*\n\nI\u2019m going to stay away from the WWII facts for the most part as I\u2019m not really a MilHis person other than to note that I\u2019m not sure \u201ctactician\u201d is the appropriate word to use to describe someone analyzing strategy and logistics. But, I do have a quibble with how it describes the flight of gold to the US.\n\nIt is, I think, helpful to make an analogy here. Suppose I am reasonably certain that my house is going to be broken into and my expensive art stolen. One thing I might do is ask to store that art in your house instead. This doesn\u2019t transfer ownership of that artwork, you just have temporary custody of it, perhaps in exchange for a fee. Alternatively, I might sell the artwork for cash and put that in a bank. Furthermore, I might use some of that cash to buy a security system and or self defense items.The Dollar Endgame, by saying that countries were worried and sent over gold to the US, makes it sound like it was mostly the first option above. I don\u2019t doubt that this was partially the case, but quite a lot of it was the second option with governments and private individuals genuinely exchanging gold for goods and services not just \u201csending it\u201d.I know this for a couple reasons. First, its fairly observable in charts of US Gold Reserves^(7):\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/KLZ75zo](https://imgur.com/a/KLZ75zo)\n\nSecond, The Dollar Endgame\u2019s own source that it cites (A blogpost from the St. Louis Fed) seems not to agree with European uncertainty as the explanation^(8):\n\n*In 1933, the U.S. suspended gold convertibility and gold exports. In the following year, the U.S. dollar was devalued when the gold price was fixed at $35 per troy ounce. After the U.S. dollar devaluation, so much gold began to flow into the United States that the country\u2019s gold reserves quadrupled within eight years. Notice that this is several years before the outbreak of World War II and predates a large trade surplus in the late 1940s. (See figure above.) Furthermore, the average U.S. trade surplus was only 0.6% of GDP during this period, highlighting the complete breakdown of fundamentals of the classical gold standard.*\n\nThe above seems to favor an explanation whereby the particulars of the US domestic economy (It\u2019s leaving the Gold Standard) caused this rise, rather than risk abroad.After making this point, The Dollar Endgame backs up slightly chronologically (it tends to jump around quite a lot) to then describe the gold standard and how it worked:In a global monetary system restrained by a Gold Standard, countries HAVE to have gold reserves in their vaults in order to issue paper currency. The Western European powers all exited the Gold standard via executive acts in the during the dark days of the Great Depression (in Germany\u2019s case, immediately after WW1) and build up to War by their respective finance ministers, but the understanding was they would return back to the Gold standard, or at least some form of it, after the chaos had subsided.\n\nWhat the Dollar Endgame is attempting to describe here, is that countries operating on a Gold Standard peg the value of their currency to a fixed amount of gold, usually offering the ability to redeem for gold or vice versa as well.There are some things worth clarifying however. First, there are three analytically separate things that might be involved in a gold standard:\n\n1. A country attempts to peg the value of its currency to a certain amount of gold.\n2. A country makes its currency redeemable for gold.\n3. A country must hold sufficient gold reserves to redeem all of its currency.\n\n1 and 2 were usually the case, but 3 was not necessarily. The above quote seems to imply a 1:1 relationship between gold reserves and currency issues, but gold reserves requirements for central banks were usually a percentage of outstanding central bank notes, not a complete requirement.^(9) Furthermore, quite a lot of countries also allowed their central bank to hold the currency of other gold standard countries as backing in place of a portion of the mandated gold.\n\nAt this point, I think it would be a useful to diverge slightly from the book to discuss how the gold standard worked. Specifically, how it related to a country\u2019s balance of payments, as quite a lot of the remainder of the book discusses historical changes that emerged very much as a reaction to the gold standard.\n\nThe standard model of how international trade and the gold standard worked was formulated by David Hume, better known for other work.^(10)\n\nConsider a world with two countries , both of whom use gold pieces as currency. Assume that in a given year one country runs a trade deficit, that is, that it imports more than it exports. Payment for those imports necessitates a flow of gold out of the country. The resulting decrease in gold circulating in the country leads to lower price levels, as fewer coins chase any given product. This, in turn, makes the exports of the country running a deficit more competitive, incentivizing greater purchases and reversing the flow of gold.\n\nThis is what as known as the Price-Species Flow mechanism, and the important takeaway is that under a gold standard issues in the balance of payments between countries are, in some sense, automatically adjusted. You won\u2019t end up running a persistent deficit as the greater the deficit, the cheaper your exports become. So, the sort of persistent trade deficit the Dollar Endgame worries about is much less likely.\n\nA natural worry here is that the model I just put to you above is inaccurate. After all, I described an economy using literally gold coins, which, as we have learned, isn\u2019t actual what the gold standard was. What about an economy where paper notes that are redeemable for gold circulate as currency?\n\nThe same basic intuition holds. Consider two economies using such notes. When Country A runs a trade deficit, it pays for the imported goods using its currency. Merchants in Country B don\u2019t have use for these notes, so they present them to Country A\u2019s bank for redemption into gold - thus basically collapsing this version back down into the Price-Species Flow model.\n\nThis, of course, wasn\u2019t the only possible way for adjustment to occur. The central bank might recognize that gold outflows are about to occur and intervene in various ways (discount rates) to lower the money supply before the outflow of gold occurs to basically the same effect.So that is what the gold standard was and, approximately, how it avoided balance of payments issues. From there, Dollar Endgame attempts to describe how the world moved on from the Gold standard to what would become the Bretton Woods System.\n\n*As the war wound down, and it became clear that the Allies would win, the Western Powers understood that they would need to come to a new consensus on the creation of a new global monetary and economic system.*\n\n*Britain, the previous world superpower, was marred by the war, and had seen most of her industrial cities in ruin from the Blitz. France was basically in tatters, with most industrial infrastructure completely obliterated by German and American shelling during various points of the war. The leaders of the Western world looked ahead to a long road of rebuilding and recovery. The new threat of the USSR loomed heavy on the horizon, as the Iron Curtain was already taking shape within the territories re-conquered by the hordes of Red Army.*\n\n*Realizing that it was unsafe to send the gold back from the US, they understood that a post-war economic system would need a new World Reserve Currency. The US was the de-facto choice as it had massive reserves and huge lending capacity due to its untouched infrastructure and incredibly productive economy.*\n\nLets entirely set aside understanding what Bretton Woods was and how it worked for the next post and just stipulate that \u201cIt\u2019s some sort of international trade agreement to do with money\u201d, even still there are severe inaccuracies here.\n\nFirst, the description that planning began \u201cas the war wound down\u201d is inaccurate. Discussions regarding what would become the Bretton Woods System began even before the war. Peruvian Bull also gets the motivation for the creation of Bretton Woods incorrect, returning to his ideas about the physical safety of gold.\n\nWhile I can\u2019t disprove that golds physical locations and related risk concerns played a marginal role, there are several reasons to think this doesn\u2019t make sense. First, there is no reason to think that the gold couldn\u2019t be physically custodied in the United States while nations still pegged currencies directly to gold. At several points during the gold standard nations didn\u2019t hold gold themselves but had it stationed in London. Second, skimming through the official documents regarding the creation of Bretton Woods, nothing is mentioned about the physical safety of gold. Of course, perhaps there was some reason this wasn\u2019t mentioned (perhaps political), but parsimony requires us not to posit secretive concerns about the worlds gold being stolen barring good reason.\n\nIt especially doesn\u2019t quite make sense to discuss the USSR as a potent threat to the safety of the gold, when it was an active participant in the first round of talks for Bretton Woods! Under TDE\u2019s telling, one must assume that the allies were constructing this system due to the threat from the USSR, while also giving it a say in the construction of the system. Again, this isn\u2019t totally implausible, but deserves a more robust defense than its given here.Lastly, Peruvian Bull claims that the idea that this new system would include the US dollar taking on a more prominent world role was broadly understood and accepted.\n\nThis was very much not the case.\n\nThe talks that occurred during this time period narrowed down to basically two suggested systems. The one put forward by the US absolutely did place the dollar as the world reserve currency, but the British plan (fun fact, it was constructed by John Maynard Keynes) deliberately did not, instead proposing the creation of a synthetic world currency called a Bancor. The settlement on the dollar was a tensely negotiated contingent outcome, not a simple de facto choice. (The settlement on the dollar may have been what drove the soviets out of the agreement).\n\nThat ends this post. Next time, I\u2019ll dive into more of what Bretton Woods was and how it (did not) work.\n\nFootnotes:\n\n1. Mishkin, F. S. (2022). The economics of money, banking, and Financial Markets.

                ">I believe (but very much could be wrong) that the first coinage we have evidence of is electrum coins used in Greece ~1000 BCE.\n\nThis is actually a deeply interesting and nuanced subject matter in its own right. Coinage as in the creation of coins meant to be exchanged for goods as a form of abstract currency does in fact appear relatively late as you mention. However, there seems to be a gradual evolution of the concept of currency where people didn't just barter for goods to exchange, but didn't use an abstract concept of money either.\n\nCurrency most likely started as a standardization scheme where metal goods were molded in specific shapes and sizes in order to make it more efficient to trade. For example, copper from Bronze age Cyprus was shipped in a characteristic oxhide shape, with standard proportions that would correspond to a certain amount of talents. There is evidence to suggest the traded metals were meant for usage therefore had no abstract value, so they are not to be interpreted as abstract currency. However, the standardization meant that these metal crafts also had a specific exchange value with respect to goods you could trade it for. It would be common then to quantify the value of goods based on the amount of talents of specific metals that it was (or could be) traded for.\n\nIt is not clear when and how exactly the transition from this type of commodity currency to actual money in the form of coins happened. It definitely happened gradually over the course of centuries though, so it is probable that coin usage and use of commodity currency coexisted at some point.",
                ">I believe (but very much could be wrong) that the first coinage we have evidence of is electrum coins used in Greece ~1000 BCE.\n\nEarliest electrum coins date from at least 560 BCE (the earliest find to my knowledge is the one at the Artemision in Ephesus). I believe it's generally accepted that coinage was \"invented\" in the early 6th century BCE.",

They sent their industrial fishing boats wich greatly reduced the number of fish available, where fishing is one of the most important, and one of the only fully functional industries of the country. Same goes for agriculture : China buys peanuts - another very developed sector in the country- above market prices and thus ruins the few locals companies that condition and sell peanuts both for the local and foreign market. \n\nOf course I give critical support to China, but really, in Africa, they're just as bad as the west.",
                "Maoists continue to be infested with brainrot",
                "You have to see this in the wider regional context. Since two decades there is an ongoing [insurgency in the Sahel Zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurgency_in_the_Maghreb_(2002%E2%80%93present)) that is partly [nationalistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azawad), mostly Islamist, and probably in the [context](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-47694445) of poor tribal herdsmen feuding with settled farmers for land, water and resources, like in the past three thousand of years of human civilisation.\n\nSo what do you do as a state leader? You [increase](https://tradingeconomics.com/mali/military-expenditure) and empower your military to \"provide security\" aka fight insurgents. However, fighting an isurgency is so hard that even the biggest military superpower on earth had to concede to it, twice. Bad news for my Mali, since frustrated, disgruntled soldiers that were recently empowered are prone to [coup you](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Malian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat), which they did in 2012.\n\nAll countries in the region except for Sudan have some form of [French/Western/UN presence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mali_War#Foreign_intervention_(January_2013)) in them for the fight against this insurgeny. This was initially successfull but got bogged down and never achieved its desired end result, an end to the guerilla war.\n\nSo you still have an active, empowered, trained and at the same time frustrated military around. There is the [thesis](https://www.meforum.org/441/why-arabs-lose-wars) that authoritarian states deliberately keep their armies weak and ineffective, lest they take power for themselves. The latest country taken as an example was Russia's army in February 2022. With an ongoing insurgency, keeping your army weak is not an option, and thus this region is to some colloquially known as the [coup belt.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_Belt)\n\nIf you are the coup leader, you are in power because you are the strongest. However, if there are foreign army units near you, who are not loyal to you but to someone else, it is a thread. [France for example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op%C3%A9ration_Licorne#Second_civil_war), after the [2020 Malian coup d'\u00e9tat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Malian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat). The Malian putschists got pressured to allow a general election and a return to civilian rule. Something that for you, as a coup leader, is not acceptable. You did the coup to *gain* power, not to lose it! And thus, the general of the 2020 coup couped again in [2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Malian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat).\n\nSo if you are the coup leader, you are in a bind. You want power. However, you can not beat the insurgency on your own. After the 2012 coup so much land was lost that the 2013 intervention was necessary. However, foreign intervention means sharing power. It is in this bind that now Wagner came along and said hey, what about hiring us instead of the French, we don't care about things like nominal democracy, we will do the fighting for you and you don't even need to share power. All it costs you is some mining rights in territory that you don't currently control anyway.\n\nFrance obviously was pissed and in the case of Mali there were some words thrown around but ultimately they got asked to leave. Niger, being next door and in basically the same bind, now does the same. Bonus points for Niger since they can now sell their coup as the glorious liberation from colonial oppression rather than [this.](https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/1794964-more-like-under-new-management)\n\nThe curious part is how Wagner will fare in fighting the insurgency or if we will see a [repeat of 2012](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbuktu_Manuscripts#Destruction_and_evacuation).",

The second one somewhat succeeded in its overall mission and took many high-quality photos of Mars' moons Phobos and Deimos but its failure happened just before the final, most important part of its mission: Getting within 150 feet of Phobos and deploying 2 landers.\n\nSince then there have been many unmanned Mars missions from many countries but no one else has tried to land on Phobos yet.",

They are designed with the assumption that one computer will fail in an obvious manner, thus at least two remaining systems can come up with the correct answer and vote out the faulty one.\n\nWhere it falls down is that it does not guarantee that the accepted answer is correct if there is no quorum. Although in practise it never happened, an interesting example is the Space Shuttle. This had no less than 5 identical redundant computers. 4 ran NASA software, however the 5th ran software written completely independently. Now this begs the question - what happens if there was a bug in NASA's code but the independent computer was fine? It would produce the correct calculation. However, to the voting logic, 4 computers would agree on one result (due to the bug) but the 5th would not, so the 5th would be voted out, and they would choose the buggy answer. Potentially catastrophic if it ever happened.\n\nMassively redundant systems originally operated in so-called lock-step, meaning they would run every calculation together and compare the results after each step. This was practical with slow computers, but as computer speeds have increased and more flight operations depend on computer calculations, it's really not suitable - it would sap too much performance. Instead, they compare the outputs of each calculation and vote then. Thus, they don't get to see where the calculation went wrong (e.g. due to a bit flip or other transient error), just that one of the machines does not agree.",

Rather its self-appointed director of its unofficial National Academy of Science, Space Research and Philosophy was a science teacher named Edward Makuka Nkoloso. Like the heads of both the American and Soviet space programs, though, he had a very clear goal: Make Zambia the first country to reach the Moon. According to Nkoloso, this aspiration of his was inspired by a flight he took as a child and a desire to walk in the clouds. He recruited twelve astronauts he referred to as \u201cAfronauts,\u201c and put them through his own series of physical and mental tests: To simulate weightlessness, they were put in an oil drum, spun around, and rolled down hills. Because he believed it was the only way to walk on the moon, Nkoloso's space cadets learned to walk on their hands. They were also required to climb and swing on a rope before it being cut to get them adjusted to the feeling of free-falling. \"",

                "I\u2019m an incoming Analyst at one of Brattle/Cornerstone/BW/AG in the middle of the deferred MBA process, so I have a bit to add here based on some anecdotal research. Before I get into details I will say that the first commenter here\u2019s summary is basically what I found in my search: **Econ consulting is quite strong for non-HSW M7, but notably less so at HSW.**\n\nI used my 1 month free LinkedIn premium to try and find this information (search function with education/current company combined). Here is what my search a few months ago found in terms of school frequency. As a disclaimer this was not at all scientific, I just observed trends from the search results of school-firm combinations I was curious about.\n\nOf the M7, Booth takes a *ton* of econ consultants\u2014this makes sense given their relative quant/econ focus. Sloan also takes a lot, but notably fewer\u2014again probably has to do with being more quant, but also with many econ consulting companies having the highest amount of their employees working out of Boston. Third in econ consulting representation was probably Columbia when we are talking about all top econ consulting firms (I am guessing due to class size). As another commenter noted, HS seems to take virtually nobody from Econ consulting, but strangely Kellogg doesn\u2019t seem to have many either. Wharton takes some but only from certain firms it seems.\n\nThere are solid numbers at the rest of T15 that seemed to be more regionally driven, with the exception of maybe Haas having a lot of people from around the country. E.g. Darden primarily gets DC office people.\n\nBreaking down into individual firms, I looked at BW, Cornerstone, AG, and a bit at Brattle and NERA. Brattle and AG seemed to send a somewhat-elevated amount to Sloan, a bunch of AG analysts exited to Yale SOM, and *lots* of Cornerstone analysts to Wharton. With Wharton, I barely saw *anyone* from Brattle, or AG; maybe a few from NERA (I am forgetting now).\n\nI didn\u2019t really look at Compass or CRA, although if anyone else wants to take a look at those I\u2019d be very curious to hear what they find.",

                "Klaus Schwab, founder of the WEF, coined the phrase 'Great Reset' - which he used to refer to the economic changes he believed would be necessary following the end of the Covid-19 pandemic. Great Reset was the name for the 50th annual meeting of the WEF. The meeting itself was fairly standard.   \n\n\nThe term has spawned a conspiracy theory of the same name, which portends that elites in charge of originations like the WEF deliberately caused the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as many other catastrophes, in order to bring about a change in world governance and finance - that transforms the world into a communist hell-scape that specifically targets conservatives. \n\nConservatives often envision this as a world where \"You will own nothing, eat bugs, live in a pod, and be happy about it\" or some other summary to that effect. This is not so much based on the actual content of the WEF's meetings, as much as it's based on a bizarre game of telephone played out across conservative social media.",
                "Many, erm, interested parties pretend that the WEF is a big deal but in terms of actual efficacy in changing world economic policy they really just aren't. \n\nSaying so deflects away from the IMF and World Bank though, who actually *do* have huge effects but are presently trying to run away from their past in the face of China's Belt and Road initiative.",
                "It's very big in the conspiracy-universe. You can basically substitute it for \"The Illuminati\" and it'll get the same point across, referring to the faceless global elite secretly controlling everything",
                "The world economic forum is a giant lobbying group for the most powerful corporations on earth. \n\nI imagine the only reason Le Pen would claim opposition to it is because of conspiracies around \u201cJewish bankers,\u201d even though the right loves bending over backwards to please such private interests",
                "The main problem related to WEF is that they are a private organization (not public). \n\nThe second problem is the lack of transparency, you have a private organization funded by billionares that's hosting event with *selected* politicians to discuss the future of Europe and the world. Some discussions are public, but we don't get to see all the discussions, all the documents and we cannot know if there are agreement or plans that are not disclosed to the public.\n\nFinally, the last problem is that this organization has no one supervising them. The risk of lobby-ing or biased influence to the governments is extremely high and no one is able to supervise what is going on.\n\nThis is a serious threat to democracy, and quite frankly my personal opinion is that at the current stage organizations like WEF or UN have more power than citizens when it comes to influence governments.",
                "People don't like institutions like WEF for the same reason they dislike and distrust the world bank, IMF, UN, EU etc.  We don't like these huge unaccountable multilateral organizations taking the place of national sovereignty and the will of the people of a nation\n\nThese things basically act as huge lobbyists for multinational corporations and wealthy individuals \n\nThere are a lot of conspiracy theories but they are based on grains of truth and legitimate concerns.  Dismissing these concerns wholesale in the face of the failure of globalization is what is making people turn against the left",
                "The problem with the WEF is its a private org, funded by the 0.1%ers to enact an agenda of their choosing. \n\nTo carry this agenda out they recruit potential political candidates from most western countries.  They train and indoctrinate the successful ones and then assist them into elected office in their home countries.  As this has built up its is becoming easier and easier for them to \"select\" our political leaders.  The list is getting big.\n\nJust in Canada as an example.  The PM Justin Trudeau, the deputy PM Chrystia Freeland, and leader of the NDP Jagmeet Singh are all WEF.  Freeland serves on the board.  How a person can serve at such a high level in a government and on a board of an organization with such an agenda is beyond me.  There are about 30 or so more politicians in Canada that have been elected to federal office and are members of WEF.\n\nIt really doesn't matter what their agenda is, its not remotely a good idea to allow that kind of outside influence to shape a countries policy.  Even if you agree with it, there will be a time you don't.\n\nThe second problem I have with them is their agenda is based on an ideology I am completely opposed to.  They have an outlook that implies humans must be strictly controlled, access to resources strictly controlled, overall population reduction.  Of course the elite they represent will sit atop this giant pile of human misery they envision.\n\nThere are a lot of conspiracy theories surrounding them.  Mainly with the Great Reset and covid.  The main source of these views is because of their own statements where they almost gleefully stated how Covid created a great opportunity to \"reshape\" society.  Thats when they come up with the posters about \"You will own nothing and be happy\" and a bizarre campaign to get people used to the idea of eating bugs.  That kind of action, using a crisis to force an agenda, and the bizarre media ads is ripe for a conspiracy theory.  It almost writes itself.\n\nThe more you look around at the really connected wealthy people and groups, the more you start to see this agenda take shape.  Two of the richest firms in the world that most people are completely ignorant about is Blackstone and Blackrock.  You can check any number of news stories over the past few years of both buying gigantic swaths of homes in the US.  Would you care to guess who the two largest financial investment firms are that fund WEF?  \"You will own nothing and be happy\" is not so far off.",

                ">what is it about \"globalism\" that scares some people\n\nSupporters of globalism (mostly far left people) will never admit this, but the only way globalism truly works in our world is by bringing the quality of living ***down*** (and in some aspects, significantly so) for people currently living in developed western countries. \n\nThe fantasy that one day all of these 3rd world countries will have their citizens elevated to a life of luxury goods, expensive cars, cutting edge electronics, gourmet foods, etc. is a delusion.\n\nInstead, for most of us (the middle class and below anyway) our lives will need to continue to deteriorate to a point where we're all using public transportation, living in rented generic manufactured housing (think stereotypical \"[commie block housing](https://media.wired.com/photos/5d487610e65adc00081a1c08/master/pass/photo_eastern-blocks_13.jpg)\"), eating simple, cheap, mass-produced food (likely plant or insect based).\n\nI know, people will read this and think, \"that's crazy! what a nutjob!\" but we're already seeing the basis for this now, with food becoming prohibitively expensive, with a permanent rental class established, with new cars out of reach for many, and reliable used cars becoming more difficult to find, wage stagnation, and late stage capitalism allowing for very little innovation.\n\nFor \"globalism\" to work, it demands that most of us (middle class and below) step up and acknowledge that our lives are going to get worse so that people in other parts of the world, who admittedly are even worse off than us, can have better lives. Call me cold and callous, but I care more about me and mine, and therefore am not a willing participant in this game.\n\nedit: and no I don't believe one single \"evil genius\" is behind this.

Corporations which have connections to the leaders of the countries . which means that what is discussed at davos is being pushed into the governments by the corporations. Also, the WEF has programs in which they train people that are then going to become leaders of said countries. Example: Trudeau - PM of canada, Scott Morisson - PM of Australia, Emmanuel Jean-Michel Macron - president of france and there are others which you can look for yourself further. You can check their website and see how many of the people that finished that program are currently involved in positions of authority and in which country, I am not going to do that now . But you can see if you have eyes to see that Trudeau is a tyranical b@stard and people from Canada already hate him. They are involved in the governments already through these \"young leaders\". I do not think it's a good idea to downplay the dangers of the great reset. they do not care about freedom, they want control via digital identity. you will not be able to access the internet anonymously. There will also be a Centralised Bank Digital Currency which will replace regular money. I don't have to tell you that you won't be able to buy anything without being known by the central bank. Which is already happening with our banks, but at least for the moment we still have cash which we can use anoynmously, and well, you still have that freedom. which you will lose. The problem with thinking that these guys are only some guys that have no power and simply meet to talk and no government is going to listen to them is the fact that beign so rich and powerful in regards to the corporations, they have connections and freakin money. you don't think that matters in any way and that the money flow directs what is happening in the world?  how can you say that the top 1% of this world including the dude that owns Blackrock do not have highly placed connections? This is absurd and naive . Don't believe me cause 90% of people will call me a conspiracy theorist. It's ok if you don't take my word for it, I respect you for that, but I advise you to simply continue looking into it for yourself.

It isn't about whether or not someone will hack you, it's about whether they can keep the money that buys them influence over you. Cybersecurity is a massive industry *because* it protects the wealth class. It locks up their money, their property, their data, not yours. \n\nTo them, their collapse worry is about loss of status.

                "I posted this as a reply in the comments, but it merits its own post.\n\nThe Great Reset isn't a conspiracy, but something more - A recognition of the immiserating trajectory of world capitalism.\n\nCompare Marx's statements in *The German Ideology* to the WEF:\n\n> This \u201calienation\u201d (to use a term which will be comprehensible to the philosophers) can, of course, only be abolished given two practical premises. **For it to become an \u201cintolerable\u201d power, i.e. a power against which men make a revolution, it must necessarily have rendered the great mass of humanity \u201cpropertyless,\u201d** and produced, at the same time, the contradiction of an existing world of wealth and culture, both of which conditions presuppose a great increase in productive power, a high degree of its development. And, on the other hand, this development of productive forces (which itself implies the actual empirical existence of men in their world-historical, instead of local, being) is an absolutely necessary practical premise because without it want is merely made general, and with destitution the struggle for necessities and all the old filthy business would necessarily be reproduced; and furthermore, **because only with this universal development of productive forces is a universal intercourse between men established, which produces in all nations simultaneously the phenomenon of the \u201cpropertyless\u201d mass (universal competition)**, makes each nation dependent on the revolutions of the others, and finally has put world-historical, empirically universal individuals in place of local ones. Without this, (1) communism could only exist as a local event; (2) the forces of intercourse themselves could not have developed as universal, hence intolerable powers: they would have remained home-bred conditions surrounded by superstition; and (3) each extension of intercourse would abolish local communism. Empirically, communism is only possible as the act of the dominant peoples \u201call at once\u201d and simultaneously, which presupposes the universal development of productive forces and the world intercourse bound up with communism. **Moreover, the mass of propertyless workers \u2013 the utterly precarious position of labour \u2013 power on a mass scale cut off from capital or from even a limited satisfaction and, therefore, no longer merely temporarily deprived of work itself as a secure source of life \u2013 presupposes the world market through competition. The proletariat can thus only exist world-historically, just as communism, its activity, can only have a \u201cworld-historical\u201d existence.** World-historical existence of individuals means existence of individuals which is directly linked up with world history.\n\n\"Own nothing, be happy\" - the WEF\n\n\nFor it to become an \u201cintolerable\u201d power, i.e. a power against which men make a revolution, it must necessarily have rendered the great mass of humanity \u201cpropertyless,\u201d - Marx\n\nThe WEF isn't trying to take over the world because their membership by and large already run it, albeit on a competitive basis. What the WEF is doing is signalling to other big capitalists that this crisis of immiseration is going on. The final boss of capitalism isn't Klaus Schwab in a Bond villain lair on the moon, but an absolute crisis of capitalism stripping property from the working class all at once and altogether.\n\nThe process will take a long, long time. Resistance will begin and has begun with the petit-bourgeoisie, who will lose and be proletarianized, as Marx predicted. This is the first necessary half of the process of humanity achieving Communism. \n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch02.htm\n\n> You are horrified at our intending to do away with private property. **But in your existing society, private property is already done away with for nine-tenths of the population; its existence for the few is solely due to its non-existence in the hands of those nine-tenths. You reproach us, therefore, with intending to do away with a form of property, the necessary condition for whose existence is the non-existence of any property for the immense majority of society**.\n\nBut is not itself sufficient for it.\n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1843/letters/43_09-alt.htm\n\n> \nI am therefore not in favor of our hoisting a dogmatic banner. Quite the reverse. We must try to help the dogmatists to clarify their ideas. In particular, communism is a dogmatic abstraction and by communism I do not refer to some imagined, possible communism, but to communism as it actually exists in the teachings of Cabet, Dezamy, and Weitling, etc. This communism is itself only a particular manifestation of the humanistic principle and is infected by its opposite, private property. **The abolition of private property is therefore by no means identical with communism and communism has seen other socialist theories, such as those of Fourier and Proudhon, rising up in opposition to it, not fortuitously but necessarily, because it is only a particular, one-sided realization of the principle of socialism.**\n\nThe abolition of property for the working class occurs within capitalism. This then eventually compels the abolition of property for the bourgeoisie in turn.\n\nThis process was not occurring in Russia, China, Cuba at al., which is why they could not be Communist. Capitalism does indeed have to be developed to a very specific point - the point that immiseration occurs because the amount of fixed capital drives down the rate of profit and can no longer be shortcircuited via war etc. This is now occurring.\n\nYou can't take property from the workers of another nation via war any longer because of nukes. You can't do it by landing in Manhattan and giving them beads because it's been done the world over. You can only do it now by taking the property off the existing working class. And this is what drives revolution.",

                "Answer: The World Economic Forum is a NGO lobbying organisation founded in 1971 by Klaus Schwab as the European Management Forum, in 1987 Schwab changed the named to what we now know today. Since the founding in 1971 Schwab has been to first and only chairman of the organisation. \n\nThe goal of the World Economic Forum is to provide a place where national leaders and captains of industry can meet and discuss matters of global or national relevance. The best known event hosted by the World Economic Forum is their annual meeting in Davos, followed by the \"Annual Meeting of the New Champions\" hosted during summertime either in Dalian and Tianjin. \n\nSo why is the World Economic Forum such a target for conspiracy theorists? The organisation and it's meetings tick a good number of boxes that would lend it to being a purported evil club of people wanting world domination: The meetings at Davos are a who's who of powerful people and these meetings happen mostly behind closed doors. Only plenary sessions are public. In the past the World Economic Forum has refused accreditation to journalists who were (legitimately) critical of the organisation. The finances of the World Economic Forum are not transparent, nor is it clear why someone is invited or not invited to become a member and attend meetings, same for the invitations for journalists and their level of access to the events. Put all of this together, throw in a hot topic like covid restrictions, and it can make a fine starting point for any conspiracy theory. It doesn't even have to be the World Economic Forum, you could just as easily substitute them for the Bilderberg Group, which works the same.",

                "answer:  \n\n\n You won't find any definitive answers here because the subject is larger than the question asked, as is often the case.It refers to the question of how the current state of human civilization is governed both overt and covert.  \n\n\n  \nYou will find strawman arguments on both sides of the argument with the paranoid disenfranchised on the one extreme and the normalcy biased entrenched beneficiaries of the current system on the other.  \n\n\nSafe is to say that the ruling elites for better and for worse , consciously and unconsciously have been entrenching themselves culturally and financially against the political awakening of the masses. Possibly out of fear of and in an attempt to control any type of populism (right or left wing) that threatens the status quo.  \n\n\nBe it universal policy adoption to counter a (real, perceived or oversold) common threat (SARS-CoV-2 response, climate change management, banking crisis, ageing population) or proclaiming the virtues of the only possible way forward while decrying naysayers as morally defective in the media, there is a highly concentrated effort to collapse the spectrum of possibilities that deserve rational consideration into single paths of binary choices.  \n\n\nThis suggests there is consciousness behind this narrowing of possibilities.  \n\n\nThis could be explained by a hypothetical institutional intermingling and an elitist cultural separation from the host populations and their democratic processes (externalization of the hierarchy) where the de-facto policies are created by those with agency (suggested hotspots: WEF, IMF, Blackrock, a host of think tanks like Chatham house, RAND corporation etc) and the de-jura enshrining follows those institutional policies by fitting the resulting societal pressures ( ESG)  \n\n\nBut that does not prove it is true, nor inherently bad, nor inherently good.  \n\n\nThe creation of mass social media has brought hidden and unconscious human processes to the surface in the same way it has brought mass scrutiny of individual words and thoughts on a scale that we have developed no coping mechanisms for.  \n\n\nLearning about the way human society is structured is the way to acquire the knowledge and power to change some small thing about it.  \nDenying aspects of it or lending far to great an importance of a small aspect of it is not."

Dr. Fauci said it wasn\u2019t a leak from a lab doing gain of function research illegally funded by the US that caused the Covid and Dr. Fauci is always right. (Ignore those pesky e-mails that say otherwise.) Pres. Biden immediately came up with a vaccine that kills the Covid with no side affects. Nobody has died of Covid since Biden took office except for those in red states \u2013 \u201cthe pandemic of the unvaccinated.\u201d Just ask him. He immediately told everyone to stop wearing those stupid masks and go back to work and school and everyone did it because Biden is a humble and trustworthy government servant who receives a modest salary and pension and nothing else and Trump is a corrupt billionaire who has funny hair and orange skin. There was no loss of productivity in the workplace, and kids did really well with no loss of academic or social development once Biden took over. No bankruptcies during blue state lockdowns. Drug and alcohol addiction immediately fell under Biden and teen suicides were non existent. We had the greatest economic recovery ever. Just ask anyone. The stock market shot through the roof and inflation was under control for the first time in decades. People fled to America in droves including hundreds of known terrorists from Pakistan, Afghanistan, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Russia and China. Joe Biden was so proud he stopped construction of the southern border wall and opened it up to everyone including MS13 gang members, drug cartels from Mexico, known rapists and murders and those involved with human trafficking. Fentanyl was never cheaper or more abundant. Joe used his executive orders to get us out of the \u201cstay in Mexico\u201d accords and we re-entered the Paris climate agreements. We agreed to reduce our carbon emissions by 50% by 2035 while the two largest fossil fuel consumers China and India made zero commitments. Biden then committed to eradicating all fossil fuel production within the US by 2050, stopped granting permits to drill on public land and blocked the Keystone pipeline. Inflation skyrocketed. The price of gasoline doubled and eggs tripled and you can\u2019t find baby formula. The banking system is failing and the dollar is collapsing. Well, Biden did keep us out of a war. (Not really.) 100 billion spent and growing in Ukraine and Russia and China have formed the BRICS currency to replaced the US dollar as the international default currency. The withdrawal from Afghanistan was ok except for the 13 Americans who died and the fact we left an airbase and 80 billion in high grade military weapons to a terrorist country. Predictably, the troops are demoralized and recruitment is historically low but you can now learn about white aggression while in the military and get the government to pay for your sex change operation. Or you can just learn about these things in kindergarten. Well, at least the streets are safe and we have a fair and functioning justice system. After all, nobody is infringing on my right to free speech, or religious liberty, or to own a gun for protection and elections are fair.

                "Title: Enhancing Democratic Participation through a Mobile Application: A Case Study Abstract: This paper presents a case study of a mobile application designed to enhance democratic participation. The application allows users to participate in the democratic process by providing a platform for them to engage in discussions, suggest solutions, and vote on issues at local, state, and federal levels. By leveraging the power of mobile technology, the application promotes transparency, accountability, and civic engagement. The study finds that the application has the potential to increase political efficacy and promote a more informed and engaged citizenry. Introduction: Democratic participation is a cornerstone of modern society. The ability of citizens to participate in the political process is essential to ensuring a healthy democracy. However, in recent years, there has been a decline in democratic participation. This decline is due to a variety of factors, including a lack of trust in political institutions, a sense of political apathy, and the rise of misinformation. This paper presents a case study of a mobile application designed to enhance democratic participation. Methodology: The mobile application was designed to provide users with a platform for engaging in discussions, suggesting solutions, and voting on issues. The application was tested in a small pilot study in which participants were asked to use the application to engage in discussions and vote on local and state-level issues. Participants were also surveyed on their political efficacy and their perceptions of the application's usefulness. Results: The pilot study found that the mobile application had a positive impact on political efficacy. Participants who used the application reported feeling more informed about local and state-level issues, and more confident in their ability to participate in the democratic process. Additionally, participants reported that the application was easy to use and that it provided a valuable platform for civic engagement. Conclusion: The mobile application represents a promising tool for enhancing democratic participation. By leveraging the power of mobile technology, the application provides users with a platform for engaging in discussions, suggesting solutions, and voting on issues at local, state, and federal levels. The application has the potential to increase political efficacy and promote a more informed and engaged citizenry. Further research is needed to explore the long-term impact of the application and to identify ways to improve its effectiveness. However, the results of this pilot study suggest that the application is a valuable tool for enhancing democratic participation. to be used with taxcoin",

Would you support this? here\u2019s a chatgpt breakdown of such an idea: **taxcoin** \n\nCertainly! Here is a comprehensive breakdown of the benefits of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) supported blockchain architecture for integrated tax, financial, tax computation, and reserve monetary compensation: Streamlined Taxation Process: An AI-supported blockchain architecture can automate tax payments and refunds through the use of smart contracts, reducing the administrative burden on taxpayers and tax authorities. This automation can result in more accurate and efficient tax collection. Enhanced Security and Privacy: The use of blockchain technology in tax collection and financial transactions ensures that all transactions are transparent and immutable, reducing the risk of fraud and other financial crimes. Additionally, cryptographic hashing and encryption can be utilized to protect sensitive taxpayer data from unauthorized access or modification. Increased Efficiency: The use of AI in tax collection and financial transactions can help to reduce errors, minimize manual intervention, and improve transaction processing times, resulting in increased efficiency and cost savings. Improved Transparency: The use of distributed ledger technology in tax collection and financial transactions creates an immutable record of all transactions, enabling tax authorities and other stakeholders to easily track and audit tax payments and financial transactions. Reserve Monetary Compensation: An AI-supported blockchain architecture can also support the creation of a reserve monetary system that can help stabilize financial markets during times of economic stress. By leveraging blockchain technology and AI, this reserve system can efficiently and transparently distribute monetary compensation to those in need, helping to stabilize financial markets and protect against economic downturns. Overall, the benefits of an AI-supported blockchain architecture for integrated tax, financial, tax computation, and reserve monetary compensation are numerous. By leveraging these technologies, governments and financial institutions can streamline their operations, reduce costs, increase efficiency, and improve transparency and security. User Could the blockchain be used to compute all that distributed data procedurally? ChatGPT Yes, blockchain technology can be used to compute and store distributed data procedurally. In fact, the blockchain is a distributed ledger that uses a network of nodes to store and verify transactions, which can include financial and market data. Each block in the chain contains a hash of the previous block, creating an immutable record that cannot be altered. This makes the blockchain an ideal platform for storing financial and market data, as it provides a secure and transparent way to store and verify transactions. Additionally, blockchain technology can incorporate smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. These smart contracts can be used to automate processes and reduce the need for manual intervention, making the computation and processing of distributed data more efficient and accurate.\nTitle: Blockchain Computing for Efficient Taxation and Beyond: A Comprehensive Overview Abstract: Blockchain technology has emerged as a promising solution to streamline the taxation process by leveraging distributed ledger technology and smart contracts to automate tax payments and refunds, and enhance security and transparency.

Those are things that we wish to emerge from the functioning of a cooperative society. They cannot be innate rights in the sense that you cannot expect to have health care magically endowed to you in the absence of government. Just as well, you cannot expect for a cooperative society to perfectly provide those services to everyone if the means do not exist.

That said, I could almost see the democrats in their current form supporting some advancements that would help get us closer.\n\n**GENERAL**\n\n* Do not entertain ANY cuts to existing safety net programs.\n* Revise the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) to a reasonable number and set it to adjust with inflation.\n* Implement an appropriate federal minimum wage (at least $20 /hr now) and adjust it for inflation.\n\n**FOOD**\n\n* Eliminate SNAP work requirements entirely.\n* Boost SNAP benefits by at least 35-50% across the board.\n* Eliminate separate requirements for students.\n* Fix the way benefits are calculated so that it is proportional to income. Nobody should instantly lose all of their SNAP benefits because they're $1 over the FPL. If you're over the FPL by $x, decrease benefits by $x.\n\n**HEALTHCARE**\n\nI'm not sure what the democrats would be okay with actually pushing for here. I'm a firm believer in universal healthcare, but I know mainstream democrats aren't going to get behind it. Maybe they could accept loosening Medicaid eligibility requirements or a public option as Biden has proposed in the past, while simultaneously continuing to push back on big pharma piecewise (as we've seen with insulin).\n\n**JOBS**\n\n* Invest in transportation infrastructure so people can get to work fast and cheap. High speed rail in California is great, but we still need *basic* transportation hubs in many rural and suburban areas that currently have NOTHING. This also has the added benefit of reducing emissions from cars by reducing the number of cars on the roads.\n* Educate people about unions and how to form them. Push for more unions. Do not pass any policy that undermines unions.\n\nObviously we need a lot more than this. These are just ideas I can at least see the democrats being willing to consider.",

But my roommates were stuck there for the better part of a week without groceries and ended up having to walk to the Superdome. \n\nIn 2011, I was on my last day of vacation in Tokyo, sitting at my gate in Narita airport getting ready to leave, when everything started shaking-- and it seemed to last *forever*. I was living in Los Angeles during the Northridge quake, so I knew what was happening... but that was over in a matter of less than 10 seconds. This thing felt like it went on for like 10 fucking minutes. We were evacuated from the airport and I found a cheap hotel like right across from it. The airport reopened and my flight left the next day. \n\nIn 2017, I was back living in Houston when Harvey blew in. It was a really weird hurricane. Most hurricanes blow in, pass over and that's it. Harvey just sat its big ass over Houston and pissed down for days. I went to my mom's house so I could make sure she was alright.

                "The economics in the JW universe must be massively skewed by the glut of assassins looking for work.

Katia represents all Roma (gypsies). The 3 Italian crime families sit on the table. And then the elder (unknown, arabic). \n  \nThe High Table and world of assassins is ultra-organized crime.

                "The first film wasn't bad, but when the second film had an assassin cosplaying as a homeless beggar is when I checked out, especially with the way that that film ended.

I also felt like there were too many assassins in a close area for it to be realistic.\n\nHowever, they all probably would have been communicating in regards to where John Wick is and deployed tactics to match or blend on the area he\u2019s in. Even if you saw 10,000 assassins in one area, that\u2019s still not as many people as say in a sports arena who gathered there to watch a game or for a similar cause.\n\nAlso, let\u2019s say\u2019s there\u2019s 10 million assassins, that\u2019s still only .125% of the entire population.

                "I don\u2019t think they are all full time and there are also plenty enough people in the world for that ratio to possibly be realistic. Especially considering it could be a hobby and side job for most. While the top hitters are the full time professionals.",

At the very least I\u2019d be *very* suspicious of Poirot. \n\n\nAlso consider the total population of the UK\u2019s Wizarding World whose entire seven-year cohort is at Hogwarts, a school with about a thousand students. Yet it acts like it had the economic and social scale of a massive sub-country (even if we allow for the fact that there are many jobs they don\u2019t need due to magic or elf labour). \n\nThe rate at which the same people in Star Trek and Star Wars keep bumping into each other goes beyond that of a typical neighbourhood but apparently it\u2019s at a galactic scale.\n\nIt\u2019s less fun when we consider such things.",

                "You're not wrong. \n\nAlso, the \"pay to survival ratio\" seems a little low to entice people to go after John Wick after he's already killed a small village of trained assassins. Everyone who died must have taken some drug that made them feel invincible.",
                "I'm watching John Wick 4 atm and thinking the same thing, also how upside down the whole world is, like people killing people in the public with not a single cop intervening, John chasing someone through bunch of people partying and killing people left and right, said party goers catching a stray bullet or a melee weapon and nobody caring?\nI feel like the movie series started as semi-realistic but took the same turn as Fast&Furious franchise; making crazier shit for every movie. As if the best life choice in this universe is ti become a criminal, to be under tha Table, or become a collateral damage and nobody giving a shit.\n\nSpoilers: >!In 4, John goes to Ruska Roma to get their blessing and accepted into the Family for their crest and gaining their blessing the ability to challenge the Marquis in a duel. Why won't they just waste all of them? He's excommunicated and any organization under the Table (which is like every single criminal entity in this universe) aiding him in any way will be dealt with. John isn't safe until the sunrise at the location of the duel, so it'd be easy to just clap him from distance. It's like this universe isn't aware of snipers and medium-to-long distance shots, unless it's convenient for the plot.!<",

We see a world much like ours, with buildings, cars, supply chains, etc.  IRL, it takes almost the entire population working 40 hours a week to create it and keep it running.  Yet, most of the population in Wick's World are experienced, professional killers.  I don't even see the other criminal enterprises (theft, drugs, etc.) that would finance the Table's generous murder bounties.",

                "Maybe it's an assassin pyramid scheme?\n\nThe people making real money aren't actually doing the killing.

In my head-cannon, I reimagine those scenes as a joke, and what actually happened is like two people who were there together (as a romantic couple or as friends) got the message in the park, and maybe one person in the subway station.  I've got no problem with NY being home to 100 assassins, who take jobs like once or twice a year.

And every contract is just a profile of some person that woukd-be assassin's can swipe on.\n\nYou'd have to have an international crime syndicate at the head of something like that, acting as the go between on payments to insure the system. \n\nLike, each contract you post requires actually putting down a deposit (so payments are guaranteed). And fulfilling the contract requires verification such as a geo-tag, photo evidence, etc... that the killer can trust wouldn't be used as evidence against them. \n\nBut if you could set that up and safely operate it outside of law enforcement oversight, you'd have a very effective app. With a trusted broker taking/returning deposits on hit job that are network-protected for the legal safety of both the client and the contractor. \n\nHonestly I bet a powerful enough criminal organization, one with political influence such as Russian Oligarchs or Saudi Oil Princes, could set this up and operate it without interference so long as contracts excluded political figures/corporate figures and their close relatives. Those are the only kinds of people with enough influence to disrupt the business. If you stuck to low income/criminal targets such as low-end political players in African/Columbian countries and regular citizens it could be used to make a pretty penny on the side by taking a contract fee.\n\nMy utter lack of faith in humanity allows me to realize that there's millions of people in this world who would easily pay upwards of 10,000 USD to have their spouse, workplace competitor, social enemy, etc... killed. A lot of people are shitty enough to even have their own family killed for returns through inheritance. \n\nIt would be a booming business. With safety nets and guarantees you're easily looking at an income in the hundreds of millions, annually, just through non-refundable contract fees of as low as 5% for contract postings. \n\nOf course there's maintenence fees. And to run the business effectively you'd want to staff computer personel who could complete light research on each target to provide names, addresses, and various other important information that should be easy enough to obtain online. \n\nYour only issue would be push back from government organizations.

                "The states banning abortion rights have, over decades, intentionally constructed an economic policy architecture defined by weak labor standards, underfunded and purposefully dysfunctional public services, and high levels of incarceration. Through a cross-sectional quantitative analysis of state level abortion access status and five indicators of economic security\u2014the minimum wage, unionization, unemployment insurance, Medicaid expansion, and incarceration\u2014we find that, generally, the states enacting abortion bans are the same ones that are economically disempowering workers through other channels.\n\nThe results of the analysis underscore that abortion restrictions and bans do have economic effects, given the strong correlation between abortion status and various economic wellbeing metrics. Further, the consistent pattern of state abortion bans and negative economic outcomes shows how abortion fits into an economics and politics of control. Abortion restrictions are planks in a policy regime of disempowerment and control over workers\u2019 autonomy and livelihoods, just like deliberately low wage standards, underfunded social services, or restricted collective bargaining power. Economic policymakers must prioritize this issue as widespread abortion bans will contribute to a loss in economic security and independence for millions in the current and future generations.",
                "This post does an 'analysis' but only finds correlation - not causation - and does so in a vacuum.  IMO this isn't scientific or economic in nature - it appears to be a bias hit article masquerading as a scientific study.\n\nWhy do I think that? Let's look at the key 'findings':\n\n>Key findings from the analysis\n\n>States with abortion restrictions or total bans have on average:\n\n>*     lower minimum wages ($8.17 compared with $11.92 in the abortion-protected states)\n>*     unionization levels half as high as those in the abortion-protected states\n>*     only three in 10 unemployed people receiving unemployment insurance (compared with 42% in other states)\n>*     lower rates of Medicaid expansion\n>*     an incarceration rate 1.5 times that of the abortion-protected states\n\nVirtually all of these things occurred BEFORE the ban on abortion and thus there can't be causation.  You are basically describing the policies and economics of poor republican and mostly southern states.\n\nThe fact that you are comparing the minimum wages (of which less than about 2% of the population are paid) of the states and not the actual average wage is bad economics.  Even then you aren't adjusting for inflation or cost of living.\n\nEveryone thinks that MS and AL are the poorest parts of the country - aka the poverty belt - but when adjusted for cost of living that is actually Southern California.  Also the average IQ scores in AL and CA are fairly close/similar.  Not related to the study - just a bonus fact.",

Religion generally ends being anti-abortion.\n\nI'm not advocating that a country with a government that intervenes less in the economy is good.

I assure you I am fine, I am not considering taking my own life at all - I just wanted to start a conversation around the legality and ethics and other issues involving euthanasia, it is not personal, and not about me. Thank you again for your concern!\n\nNo pun intended, this is a hill on which I'm willing to die. The right to end your own life painlessly and without external interference is a human right we all should absolutely have. The idea that we have to get seriously ill and suffer for months if not years until our body finally decides to give out is not acceptable. It is also a money-making scheme from the healthcare industry and government. The more they can stretch out serious illness before death, the more money they make. The more they can keep you alive to pay taxes, the more money the government makes. Religion aids this by stating that taking your own life is a first-class ticket to hell.\n\nSuicide should not be so difficult that you have to worry about whether you will not end up killing yourself, but possibly end up with brain damage or other complications from a failed attempt. Suicide should also not exempt life insurance companies from paying out once a person is dead. The entire system is set up to discourage someone from making the personal, rational, and final decision to take their own life - which is the only thing in this world that truly, 100% belongs to the person.\n\nReligion instills guilt and fear in order to prevent this, stating that the person is going to hell, and that your \"soul\" doesn't belong to you, it belongs to God. This is just another excuse to not allow people to make their own end of life decision. Not allowing birth control is another method of religious control and overreach as well. How many people would have rather not been born into the poverty, violent surroundings and disease that they are born into due to forced birth? It's another issue, but related.\n\nHow many people trapped in elder care in horrible facilities and/or living in poverty and illness would be better served by letting them decide to end their life of their own volition? Maybe some are mentally ill and should not be entrusted with that decision, but the choice should be available to those of sound mind.\n\nIt should not take someone having to buy a gun and blow their brains out, or hanging themselves, or all of these other barbaric methods to end one's life. There should be dignity in this choice somewhere, somehow. There should be a painless and non-trauma inducing way to end your life if you want to. Loved ones should not have to discover a death scene with a huge mess and a scene they will never be able to forget. One should be able to discuss the option with a doctor, end-of-life counselor or others trained to both help a person either move away from suicide or to complete it. It should not take a lethal illness to justify it, and it should not be traumatizing for the family of those who choose to do so.\n\nI don't have all the answers here - but I do strongly feel that the way things are is absolutely wrong.",

                "Not so long story of a personal account of having to watch someone suffer.  I just need to get this out.  \n\nMy mother died this past Friday at 3:25am. She was the best gift an adopted son could have ever wished for.  My mother (81, diabetic who took great care of herself, breast cancer with double mastectomy and lymph node removal) suffered (unknowingly) with stage 4 metastatic breast cancer probably for months.   She had no idea the cancer returned since her last PET scan in September came back clear. Right after that she began having pain in her back and was diagnosed with a pleural effusion (fluid buildup in the lining around her lungs). I came to visit to try to get lymphedema under control in mid January.  After going to the ER because shortness of breath and pressure in her chest, they drew 700ml of fluid from the pleura and the cytology report came back with metastatic breast cancer.  \nMy cousin and aunt had been her caretakers for about a month before I arrived (I live 2500 miles away). I learned after her death that she had been wanting to die for a while; the pain was so bad.  She had expressed to me that she wanted to die and the ever loving naive son thought of we could just get the fluid around her lungs and the lymphedema taken care of, her pain levels would drop and she could begin the road to recovery.  \n\nFor a while, before I arrived, she had been in contact with someone from hospice.  The nurse kept telling her the lymphedema wasn\u2019t a terminal condition so she couldn\u2019t be admitted for palliative care.  I watched her move, squirm, writhe in pain trying to find a comfortable position.  I would help her every 5 minutes try to get into a comfortable position, adjust pillows, anything to get her some relief.  She was on oxycodone (which wasn\u2019t enough) for at least a month.  When she went back into the hospital after talking with her primary that\u2019s when the cytology results came back and we got the news.  Stage 4 metastatic breast cancer.   At that point she said \u201cI don\u2019t want to be poked, prodded, tested, treated, I just want this pain to end.\u201d I had to tell her \u201cFlorida isn\u2019t a die with dignity State. If it was I would make all the arrangements for you, I\u2019m sorry mom\u201d. \n\nThey drew another 700ml of fluid from her lungs the afternoon after she got the cytology results and had some good relief.  The next day the hospice nurse came in and my mother signed the paperwork. The nurse asked if she wanted to be transported that evening.  We agreed that mom would stay in the hospital and would be taken to hospice in the morning.  I said goodnight and when I came back the next morning I saw my mothers health had fallen off a cliff overnight.  She was transported to hospice where they began palliative care.  I spent the first night with her where I was helping her every 2 minutes try to find a comfortable position until the nurses were able to get enough medication in her to help her sleep.  She was agitated (not angry just unable to get comfortable) and suffering.  I kissed her goodnight and told her \u201cI love you mom.  Thank you for being the best\u201d.  Those were the last words she consciously heard from me.  The next morning the physician came in to see her and pointed out the left side of her face was dropping.  Said it was either a stroke or the cancer metastasized to her brain.   She never regained consciousness.  My brother spent the next night with her so I could get sleep.  He came in and told me she died.   \n\nMy mother suffered for months because Florida doesn\u2019t allow people to make their own choices.  They have to suffer and be a burden to their families and loved ones.  No.  My mother was not a burden at all she was my mother.  Watching her deteriorate before my eyes and deal with the pain and hear she wanted to die and hearing my mother say \u201cyou should go for a bike ride for a few hours, I\u2019ll just sit in the garage with the car running\u201d that was the burden. Knowing aside from pharmaceuticals that would just mask the pain and do nothing whatsoever to cure her or end her suffering, SHE HAD NO OTHER  CHOICE OTHER THAN TO SUFFER AS SHE WATCHED HER BODY DETERIORATE AND WATCH THE  PEOPLE WHO LOVED HER MOST HAVE TO WATCH HER SUFFER.  \n\nANYONE WHO DOES NOT SUPPORT RIGHT TO DIE WITH DIGNITY AND THE PERSONAL CHOICE TO END ONES OWN SUFFERING BEFORE IT BECOMES UNBEARABLE SHOULD HAVE  TO WALK A MILE IN MY MOTHERS SHOES!!  \n\nPerhaps if they see the suffering and agony they grow some compassion and not stand by and say, \u201cIt\u2019s gods will\u201d.  Well guess what.  They love saying their gif gave mankind free will.  WHY THE FUCK ARE PEOPLE TAKING THAT FREE WILL AWAY? There is no free will when you force your ideals on others and cause them to suffer needlessly.   And don\u2019t say she\u2019s in a better place.  She\u2019s dead.  \n\nMy mother is dead and everything is worse now.",

Medicine will again catch up with life expectancy and the longer life we have will be more pleasurable for everyone. \n\nYou are right that we should be able to die with dignity. A friend of mine died a couple of years ago. He had terminal cancer with a month or two at most, in pain, with a trachea tube for breathing and a feeding tube into his stomach. Rather than being able to say \"I want a party on Thursday to say goodbye to my friends, then Friday, let me slip off quietly.\" he was forced to choose between a slow and agonising decline over the month(s), or starve himself (the one thing he did have control over) and die in a few weeks.

He held on for almost two more years after the stroke, basically spending that time as a vegetable. About 4 months before he died, the hospital had a priest come talk to my mom and her siblings about pulling his G-tube.\n\nSee, the Church doesn't condone things like assisted suicide and believes you should just ride out the rest of your life suffering. Unless, of course, the hospital is paying them to convince a family that pulling their relative's G-tube would be the right thing to do, because the person has reached the point where the medical system can no longer make money off of them. Then it's all good. You can't be quickly euthanized, but you can be starved to death over a period of ten days. Makes a lot of sense, right?",

Luckily it was pills and she was unconscious but alive when I found her. \n\nFor me, what I don\u2019t want to see happen is a situation where emergency services or even Good Samaritans are legally NOT allowed to intervene in an attempted suicide. Maybe that\u2019s just my bias talking but I have read that most people who attempt but don\u2019t succeed are glad they didn\u2019t. They just needed intervention. They needed someone to see them. \n\nBut how things are now is way worse. I later had to watch my mother slowly die of cancer instead of being able to help her to her peace. It was agonizing.

They shouldn't be onerous or costly, but enough to tell when someone needs help vs this is the best option for their diagnosis. (Of course, getting someone who needs help the help they need should also have a low barrier to entry but that's another story.)\n\nAlso, WRT insurance and suicide, it's usually a clause that only stops payout within the first couple of years of the policy. It's basically to ensure that someone doesn't try and kill themselves and use a new policy to cover a debt. But if you've held the policy for like 10 years and then committed suicide, it would typically pay out. (Usual disclaimer, every policy is different, be sure to read any policy you sign up for thoroughly and ask questions of your agent if anything doesn't make sense. In my experience they're fairly plainly written with the exception of a couple of legal points that made sense once they were broken out.) I have a feeling if the right to die with dignity were more widely recognized, policies would make a difference between suicide vs physician assisted ending of life. The second one would likely be considered \"died from X illness\" since ultimately it was that illness/condition that caused them to end their life otherwise a doctor wouldn't have approved and assisted.",

                "This is the future of working. At least it has to be.    \n\n\n\nSure there will always be some shit compagnies trying to abuse this new system as usual. Compared to the \"old\" times, when technologies weren't what they are now, our work/life ratio has become so unbalanced that we went from \"working to live\" to \"working to survive\". There is no incentive to work 40+ years of your life just to barely afford the necessities of life and I can't see this momentum of having to work huge workload for so many hours as we - as a society- currently do, for so little financial or free time rewards. A LOT of the workforce is overworked, burnt out to the bone and clearly we reached the point where this economic system based on making the base of the pyramid do more for less only for the benefit of the top of the pyramid is not longer sustainable as - from this system's point of view - there can only be a top is there is a base. And the base is crumbling, for good reasons. Seems like their greed made them abuse their own system (oh surprising...)\n    \n\nThe new generation of workers, starting with the actual workforce will root for the 4 days a week system and to be perfectly frank, we need it badly. Technologies should have been use to allow people to work less for the same amount of productivity from the start. Hell, even Keynes said so in the early 1920s that the benefit of  technological progress, should be less work hours/day for the same amount of productivity for the same financial rewards or more productivity for the same amount of work time but for more financial rewards for the WORKERS. Instead we all know what happened, more work for more time for less reward and CEOs and top got the increased productivity 's profit.    \n    \n\nPersonally I always thought that, although incredibly physical some jobs could have been a century ago, the 2 days weekend was there to physically rest. Today, most of ours jobs is not physical but require more of mental and nervous system, navigating between stress inducing work environment and mental overload of always producing more in less time. 2 days weekend are not enough to mentally rest as more than often our mental energy also needs to be use for our personal life and the different chores of life. You could decide to do nothing physical in the weekend back then and focus on the rest. Today it's hard or near impossible to turn off the brain and the stress and turn it on again on Monday morning.\n    \n\nWe need more rest days. We need to rebalance the work/life balance which include being able to afford to live, hence less hours for same financial rewards. It's not being lazy. It's being smart.",

It can't hurt to try it on a limited basis in the US either.",

A baker, a cleaner, a plumber, heck even a doctor won\u2019t get done the same amount of work in less hours. It\u2019s physically impossible. Not everyone works with their head and needs breaks to scroll Reddit, there are people who will genuinely just get less stuff done and then it amounts to a 25% salary increase. Or a deeper divide.

Lots of our providers are not genuinely competing, and the media aids and abets this.\n\n\nThe ever widening, by design, income gap means that some people are choosing between diapers and dinner, while others lose their home whilst someone else is now investing 0.5% less per month to maintain their lifestyle - but the capital class is getting richer and spending more.\n\n\nThe economy grows, record profits for the rich.

                "Capitalism is fundamentally a consumption concept.  It's also a consumption concept with no boundaries.  Pure capitalism is inherently cruel in the most biblical sense of the word.  The only constraint on capitalism is the set of laws and regulation built around it.  Interestingly, these are reactive devices meaning for each law or piece of regulation someone had to suffer to warrant the need for that law or regulation to come into effect.  This also means when you hear of ANYBODY talking about loosening any laws or regulation for any business, it is solely driven by the business to move back towards pure capitalism and to make the active choice to reharm people again.\n\nWith all of this said, capitalism is a brilliantly elegant system.  It's just one that's also a monster and will take everything from you.  To have it function within humanity with a sense of ethics and morals, the very humanity that operates on capitalism builds protections to force capitalism to adhere to basic, accepted levels of ethics and morals that the society agrees upon.  It is the business' duty to push back against this constantly.  It is society's duty to force adherence to ethical and moral guidelines.  This is a constant battle of attrition.  The very nature of capitalism and an ethical society demands it.\n\nThis also means that capitalism, if generating harm, is doing so at the discretion of that society.  It's the fault of the society to allow harm.  It's also the fault of society to put ownership of that battle of attrition on bad actors who operate on the side of business and capitalism for personal gain.  Shame on us.  Shame on us again for not utilizing our judicial system to hold parties accountable.  Society, as a whole, have a collective responsibility.",

A tree\u2019s roots hold soil in place, preventing soil erosion. If that soil was to be eroded, it could contaminate water or air sources. The tree has value.

I I misremembered my initial entry point and looked back to find I actually bought in at $17 (genuine apologies for misremembering but it was almost two years ago now)\n\nI originally thought about buying in at $4 but didn't because I bought a lot of a large cap token named after Satoshi in December instead\n\nI used my proceeds from Satoshi's project to buy as much GME as I could in January 2021\n\nRob isn't selling anything not selling anything so I didn't realize I was violating the sub's rules on self promotion, I was just sharing posts I thought the community would like.

This is the wrong conclusion to make; it simply means the current methods of fighting are not working, and people need the testicular fortitude to find and commit to methods that **do**.\n\nProtest, public pressure and collective outrage don't do shit in an age where the internet can abstract away any viral reach and momentum a movement has. The age where protests were effective ended about twenty years ago. The movements of today lack the teeth to do damage to this particular breed of enemy, and if they do not evolve, they will fail every single time.\n\nApes have copped the focused propaganda they have because what's happening here *is working*. Not the noise being made about it - no offence to those like Dave Lauer - but the simple act of finding the Achilles' Heel of a given part of the racket's operations and punishing it until the whole thing falls over.\n\nIf you take nothing else bar your gains and your shares from MOASS, apes, take this: you've found the golden mean for making movements lethal to the crime they're intended to destroy. Do your research, as you have here. Find communities that will actively contribute their own. Peer-review it, and build. Build out fucking libraries like [this one](https://fliphtml5.com/bookcase/kosyg), and use that knowledge to - politely, legally - make the criminals you're taking down hurt. If every movement had this kind of dedicated, hellbent pressure for success, they would steamroll everything that stands in their path. Because the enemy has made a business model of apathy, and uses it as a crude bludgeon to shut down anything that might otherwise have a chance to make them uncomfortable.\n\n**Everything here is a template**. One that works - and always will. Don't let this be a one-time thing. Society needs more than just MOASS for the bullshit to stop. If it doesn't, then all this has been for nothing.",

                "So, AFAIK there's no *direct* regulatory pressure against smaller cars in Europe like there is in the US (between the footprint and light truck rules), but there *are* some pressures anyway that select against them.\n\nThe ideal ICE vehicle to meet CO2 regulations is lightweight, narrow, and low... but also very long, with a sloping rear end. A subcompact hatchback is very short and has a near-vertical rear end.\n\nNow, none of that explains crossover SUVs becoming popular in Europe - they should be even *worse* in this respect, being taller and still being (for the ones replacing cars like the Fiesta) short length with near-vertical rear ends. And, they're under the same regulations in Europe.\n\nHowever, if you use more advanced technology - various engine technologies, hybrid systems, EVs, etc. - to meet the regulations, that costs more, and although it's not as bad as it is here in the US, even European car buyers want more car for their money. The cheapest way to have *more* car is to make it bigger - raw materials are a tiny portion of the cost of a car, number of manufacturing operations to assemble the vehicle is the real cost, and making the same thing but bigger is the same number of operations. And, there's three dimensions you can go bigger: wider, longer, and taller. Wider and longer are harder to park, and space is tight *anyway*, so that leaves taller, and now you've got a crossover SUV. And, that *also* pushes people towards crossovers instead of larger classes of car in general - if you want more interior space, sitting more upright gets that space without making the car longer. (Note that various tall box car designs have been popular in Japan for quite a while without the SUV-like styling, for the same reason - less efficient at higher speed, but less space used when parking than a conventional design with the same interior space.)\n\n...and that leads to the *other* thing that pushes things towards crossovers: EVs. AFAIK, the EU CO2 regulations treat all EVs as 0 g CO2e/km regardless of their efficiency, so any pressures to make an efficient EV are purely about avoiding range vs. cost tradeoffs. And, the best place to put battery is under the passenger area - protects it from crashes possibly causing a fire, does the best things for handling/stability, etc., etc. And, to be easy (cheap) to assemble, that battery will generally be a rectangular prism - no stacking groups of cells on top of other cells in certain areas. But, to maintain the same interior space, you have to raise the passenger area if you do that - in the example of cylindrical cells in a vertical orientation, basically you add 65-80 mm to the height of the vehicle, plus any space you need to keep the cells away from the body and for protective casing. (With pouch/prismatic cells, generally they'll go to a similar height to get a similar battery capacity.) And, if you lift a subcompact hatchback by, say, 75-100 mm to make room for the battery, you now have a crossover SUV anyway. (Do note that a *pure* EV design can offset some of this size increase, because it can have a longer and more forward-set passenger area than a design that has to leave room for an ICE engine. However, many automakers are now making designs that make room for both an ICE and a battery, being the worst of both worlds.)\n\nEVs also select for larger vehicles in general - longer wheelbase means more room for battery, and wider means more room for battery. Between that and the aforementioned aerodynamic issues with subcompacts, for example, you can much more easily make a long range executive sedan than a long range subcompact hatchback.",

However, unlike the general model, there is no shortage of shares. There *is* a shortage of real shares, but not synthetics. SHFs can combine covered calls and married puts to create a synthetic share ([see Fidelity's webinar presentation on synthetics for further details](https://www.fidelity.com/bin-public/060_www_fidelity_com/documents/SyntheticOption_Webinar.pdf)). This is why registering your GME shares makes matters more costly and difficult for SHFs in the long run. And in the event all shares get accounted for (the free float gets locked), MOASS would ignite, as there would no longer be room for fake shares to exist when every GME share has been publicly and visibly recorded. Although, the MOASS would most likely take place well before then.\n\nWe can obtain further confirmation of price suppression (and a SHF imposed price ceiling), by analyzing DRS rates.\n\nComputershare accounts have only been increasing since nearly an entire year.\n\n[Courtesy of Ape \\\\\"8ate8\\\\\"](https://preview.redd.it/reuyhg5d8cc91.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7ca21dd986a302c41fde1f1f88a37af8c4dd9e2)\n\nSame with DRS'ed shares. These are the number of registered shares since the past month.\n\n[computershared.net](https://preview.redd.it/dyrkrslj8cc91.png?width=1205&format=png&auto=webp&s=714a23e0a046ba2735191b3c5e5234975dcadd7f)\n\nSince September 2021, Apes have registered over 16 million GME shares, yet instead of the price steadily increasing along with DRS rates increasing, it has steadily been going down in the long-term (this is because of SHF price suppression and because their critical margin levels have continued to slowly decrease over time). The current GME price movement is inconsistent with a stock that is actively being directly registered, and especially when registration rates are increasing per quarter (as confirmed by GameStop's most [recent 10Q](https://news.gamestop.com/static-files/5df55006-ebe2-478e-8058-d88a7b5b3d88)). As such, it can be said with a high degree of confidence that there is heavy price suppression from SHFs, which is algorithmically constraining GME from reaching legitimate price discovery.\n\nSynthetics, IOUs, dark pool manipulation, short ladder attacks, spoofing, FTDs, and a variety of other means of manipulation are used to prevent the price from surpassing the SHF imposed price ceiling (aka critical margin levels).\n\nWhen the time comes for SHFs to close all their short positions, whether it be due to DRS, failed margin calls, etc., or a SHF is being liquidated and the DTCC computers kick in to close all short positions, the shares will need to be bought at whatever price.\n\nIn this case, we're dealing with a perfectly inelastic demand and relatively inelastic supply. The supply is relatively inelastic, as it's being obstinately held (as well as directly registered).\n\nThe following graph illustrates this circumstance:\n\n[Perfectly inelastic demand meets relatively inelastic supply](https://preview.redd.it/y8he6fso8cc91.png?width=1118&format=png&auto=webp&s=11dcb0d4a9defbb7a91948bd594b6452cb249fd2)\n\nAs you can see, no matter how high the price goes, the demand stays the same, because the shares *must* be bought, regardless of the price. The price ceiling would not only be lifted, but the one's that imposed the price ceiling (SHFs) would be forced to buy back every share at whatever the price, in order to close their short positions \\[DTCC would take over closing the positions upon default of a clearing member\\]. This scenario is a nightmare for SHFs, though an inevitability, as their price suppression on GME is unsustainable in the long-term.\n\nNow, let's take a look at an example of a situation where there was relatively inelastic demand and supply. Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency that had originally started as a fraction of a penny grew to a currency worth a solid 5 figures. Bitcoin was not heavily shorted by SHFs, unlike GME. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange didn't even introduce derivative trading on Bitcoin up until it had already hit 5 figures.\n\nIt has an inelastic supply cap at 21 million, millions of which haven't been mined or had been lost.\n\nFOMO was the sole driver that increased Bitcoin's value by 100,000,000%+.\n\nIn the case of GameStop, not only will FOMO start playing a more visible role once the synthetics get closed, but because SHFs need to close ALL their short positions, this will pose a situation much more destructive than Bitcoin's 100,000,000%+ increase. Bitcoin's increase came from relatively inelastic demand. There were many buying and holding the coin, but it was their choice. In the case of GME, SHFs MUST buy the shares. As such, demand will be *perfectly* inelastic. They have no choice but to buy the shares, because they need to close all their positions. Considering this, as well as the fact that there's at least [200% outstanding GME shares](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/qxljfb/the_numbers_are_in_mountains_of_gme_synthetic/) (something Bitcoin never had, as it was built on blockchain), in addition to the fact that there's countless Apes refusing to sell their shares no matter what, and comparing the GME MOASS to Bitcoin's 100,000,000%+ increase may ultimately be understating the yield of the MOASS.\n\nThe supply of available GME shares for SHFs to close their short positions will be logarithmic. FOMO alone would take GME to the 4-5 figure range (this is confirmed by the SEC Report \\[which stated the 100x Jan 2021 run was from FOMO\\] as well as IBKR Chair Peterffy last year). When short positions start getting closed, the paper hands' shares will be the easiest for SHFs to obtain, but as SHFs keep buying the shares, the last 50+ or so million will be almost impossible. After all the paper hands are gone, SHFs will be still need to buy ALL the shares, and the final tens of millions will need to be bought from pure-blood diamond handed Apes. If you'd like to get a sample of who are the pure-blood diamond handed Apes, take a look at whose registering their shares. Diamond Handed Apes aren't going through the process of registering their shares for Mickey Mouse numbers. They demand phone number prices. This is why the more time goes on, the higher DRS numbers increase, and the more explosive MOASS will be.\n\nDiamond Handed Apes are what will take the price of GME from $100,000 straight to the millions during MOASS. After all the paper hands are gone, SHFs will be left with diamond handed Apes, and since they must close ALL their short positions, they have no choice but to purchase shares from diamond handed Apes at whatever the price. And if diamond handed Apes refuse to sell until the price surpasses their accepted floor (for instance, the floor on [gmefloor.com](https://gmefloor.com)), then the DTCC must obtain shares at these prices in order to close out the short positions.\n\nA GME price in the millions is more than possible, due to the [geometric mean as well as synthetic shares.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/t3zp4h/we_are_unstoppable/)\n\n**\u00a72: Stock Split (In the Form of a Dividend)**\n\n[According to GameStop's 8K on July 6, 2022](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000132638022000100/gme-20220706.htm), GameStop announced a 4:1 stock split in the form of a dividend. The 3 additional shares will be distributed \"after the close of trading on July 21, 2022\".\n\nI originally discussed in my [Checkmate DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/txnwhu/checkmate/) how I consider the stock split (in the form of a dividend) to be a catalyst for MOASS. Regardless of what happens, RC's decision to implement a stock split dividend is a very powerful move, and will greatly benefit Apes post-split.\n\nFirstly, I argued how the stock split dividend would be a catalyst based on the following logic:\n\nPremise 1: Synthetic shares were created.\n\nPremise 2: The stock split dividend will need to be given to ALL shares, real or synthetic.\n\nPremise 3: There exists only enough dividends for the real shares, not synthetics.\n\nConclusion: Upon distribution of the stock split (in the form of the dividend) fake shares will be revealed (as there's not enough dividends to satisfy the synthetics). Therefore, someone, whether a broker or SHF, is going to be in big trouble.\n\nFurthermore, there's a limit to how many synthetics SHFs can create. If SHFs were capable of creating unlimited synthetics, GME would've been cellar boxed years ago. That, and they could've prevented the 100x GME rally leading to January 2021 altogether without needing to shut off the buy button (I also shouldn't have to remind you that removing the buy button created an insane amount of public backlash and chaos, and if unlimited synthetics could've been printed, all that could've been avoided to begin with). Hence, SHFs are not able to create unlimited synthetics. There's a limit to how many synthetics they can create. What that limit is, I don't entirely know. But there *must* be a limit.\n\nThis would make a stock split dividend devastating to them. For example, say they can only create a maximum of 1 million synthetics a week, and now when the stock split (in the form of a dividend) gets announced, they need to come up with hundreds of millions of shares before it gets implemented. It's been about 4 months since it got announced, and now it's about to get implemented. Did they get enough time to come up with enough synthetics? I personally don't think so, but if somehow the stock split dividend does not become a catalyst and nothing happens when implemented, I will assume one of 3 things happened (or a combination of the 3):\n\n* Brokers gave IOUs instead of the dividends.\n* SHFs used some sort of legal loophole around it that I wasn't aware of.\n* SHFs came up with a fraction of the necessary synthetics to substitute the dividends and got help from brokers (and other loopholes) to take care of the rest.\n\nHere's the thing, though...if a broker does replace a dividend with an IOU, they are virtually guaranteeing themselves bankruptcy, so unless they were already anticipating going bankrupt, this would literally be a self-destructive decision. Maybe Robinhood would do it because they were already expecting to go bankrupt during MOASS, but I find it hard to believe that the brokers managing trillions would do it. But if they are found to having done just that, then take that as a sign that the MOASS will be much more nuclear than even I anticipated.\n\nAs I explained in my [Checkmate DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/txnwhu/checkmate/), even if the stock split dividend isn't a catalyst for MOASS, it *will* subsequently increase demand for GME shares significantly:\n\n\u00a71 of my Checkmate DD: \"Let\u2019s say that, hypothetically, there was some hidden loophole they took advantage of and were somehow able to evade sparking MOASS from the stock split. In that case, as we\u2019d continue to patiently wait for MOASS, we\u2019d find DRS rates to increase post-split. This is primarily because the stock split will increase demand in GME, and as such, increase demand for registered shares.\n\nThe ticker price is a matter of perception. Retail investors are generally more inclined to purchase whole shares rather than fractional shares. Hence, registered shares would also increase post-split, especially the ones under \u201cbook\u201d, as you can\u2019t \u201cbook\u201d a fractional.\n\nSimply put, not only will demand increase for GME shares post-split, but also the rate of registered shares.\n\nExample: You have $200, but the price of GME is $150. You can only purchase 1 share. 75% of your potential purchasing power has been utilized. A 7:1 split is introduced, bringing the price to approx. $21.43 per share. You can purchase 9 shares instead for approx. $192.87. Over 96% of your potential purchasing power has been utilized instead.\"\n\nHere\u2019s a graph to better illustrate:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mzmohaiu8cc91.png?width=1440&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4904b2afac3169cacfe6ac9537a78009ca58442\n\nFurthermore, as the current price gets divided by 4, so does the critical margin level. I'd consider $190 a solid level where SHFs could get margin called. Although the real level is lower, I prefer conservative estimates to be sure. And at $250 I'm virtually certain they'd get margin called.\n\nWell, at a price of $140, post-split price would be $35, and critical margin levels would be at $48. And I'd put absolutely guaranteed margin call levels at $63. With such low prices, the demand for shares will be significantly stronger, and as such, much harder for SHFs to contain below critical margin levels. Fun times ahead!\n\n**\u00a73: GameStop's Fundamentals**\n\nTo ascertain GameStop's future fundamental performance, I'll be utilizing the Cobb-Douglas production function. The Cobb-Douglas production function is used to represent the technological relationship between inputs and outputs. It's commonly used in the manufacturing industry, but has also been applied to a variety of companies. In the case for GameStop, this quantitative model can work by substituting the correct inputs. For instance, higher capital should yield higher output/productivity, and with that comes higher profit margins. The ratio of capital to productivity is not one-to-one, as we must take into account diminishing marginal returns, which the Cobb-Douglas production function does an excellent job at taking into account.\n\nThe following slides are my analysis:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xnehq0my8cc91.png?width=1359&format=png&auto=webp&s=26caeed3b4016a38a56daeb377c932d3d8ed502d\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h9fcjnyz8cc91.png?width=1355&format=png&auto=webp&s=c7b266db114c1b9f1b6e1768b55d5c0f350c6ce9\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g9ywm0319cc91.png?width=1341&format=png&auto=webp&s=ccf45586883cc1a7f5bbc9fad62643b82c90d5d8\n\nResearch conducted by the [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2017/03/great-companies-obsess-over-productivity-not-efficiency) determined the best companies were 40% more productive than the rest, and their profit margins were, on average, 40% higher than industry peers. Simply put, productivity increases are comparable to profit margins increases.\n\nAs for labor rates, I went off [Macrotrends](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GME/gamestop/number-of-employees#:~:text=GameStop%20total%20number%20of%20employees,a%2012.5%25%20decline%20from%202019). Due note: even if labor rates were to decrease, it might not equate to less productivity, as the extra capital that comes from specific labor reductions could be used instead towards larger, more focused projects that could generate even more profit margins. It's not a straightforward evaluation.\n\nBy no means am I expecting the production function to precisely pinpoint the exact productivity increase from GameStop (there is no quantitative model complex enough to take every single variable into account). However, consider this as a general model projecting a significant increase in productivity as time goes on.\n\nWhat the production function does not take into account is the NFT Marketplace, which will be playing a significant role in GameStop's fundamentals and profit margin increases going forward.\n\nI did point out the potential of the NFT Marketplace in \u00a76 of my [2022: Year of the MOASS](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/uf8pm6/2022_year_of_the_moass_8_reasons_why_soon/) DD, and will be reiterating it here.\n\n\"The NFT Market was valued at $40 billion in 2021, [per Chainalysis Inc. report](https://content.techgig.com/technology-unplugged/nft-market-touched-40-billion-in-2021-new-estimate-shows/articleshow/88773041.cms).\n\nConsidering GameStop\u2019s market cap is valued at $10 billion, there\u2019s a lot of potential revenue GameStop can tap into by entering this market. Not only that, but as time goes on and crypto/NFTs become more globalized, the NFT Market can easily exponentially increase in valuation, similarly to how Bitcoin did when it started getting adopted by institutions internationally as a store of value.\n\nOpenSea, currently the world\u2019s largest NFT Marketplace, is valued over $13 billion, [according to Sephton at \u201cCoinMarketCap Alexandria\u201d](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/opensea-now-has-a-valuation-of-13-3-billion).\n\nYet, the OpenSea NFT Marketplace is incommensurable to the soon to be GME NFT Marketplace, due to a variety of reasons:\n\n1. OpenSea has extremely high gas fees, which deter business/revenue through their services and creates dead weight loss.\n2. Weak security protocols. They have tons of vulnerabilities in their code that make them susceptible to attacks/thefts. Many examples in the past of OpenSea users suing the Marketplace for letting their NFTS get stolen by cyber thieves due to their \u201csecurity vulnerabilities\u201d.\n3. GameStop gets nearly 1,000x more organic traffic via search engines than OpenSea does.\n\nGME succeeds where OpenSea fails, by utilizing its partnerships with Loopring & Immutable X to eliminate high gas fees as well as reinforce security, using Ethereum\u2019s security rather than Polygon\u2019s (etc.). GameStop\u2019s NFT Marketplace will not only supersede, but augment the NFT Market as the dominant NFT Marketplace.\n\nThat being said, GME\u2019s market cap is already $10 billion. Say they get in the NFT Market in the summer and hit a valuation just half that of OpenSea this year. GME would end up with a high enough valuation putting itself past a $200 price. Maintaining a GME price past $200 would obliterate critical margin levels at this point, initiating MOASS.\n\nIn case you haven\u2019t noticed, something very big is gearing up this year, and I don\u2019t think RC bought extremely OTM BBBY calls this year just for the fun of it.\"\n\nGameStop has already launched its Beta Stage of its NFT marketplace as of July 11, and so far it has already exceeded expectations:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hx60lre39cc91.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d93120ceca3fc3cc49758342b396acc116552f6\n\n\\[[Link to tweet](https://twitter.com/GMEshortsqueeze/status/1546704254718681088?s=20&t=3TqmD-dZPxqn4x5MhxwQgw)\\].\n\nDue note that this is all with the marketplace simply in Beta Stage (or in this case, Phase 0):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yure9mt59cc91.png?width=1069&format=png&auto=webp&s=e369b339ca1e34ceb3cbad97c39475629b75b4e2\n\nThis marketplace is most certainly a game changer for GameStop, and so it's not surprising that the opposition is feeling threatened and will try to control growth in the GameStop NFT marketplace.\n\nIn addition to negative MSM campaigns against the GameStop NFT marketplace, you can see that SHF owned companies, like the Motley Fool, have already dominated SEO for NFT Marketplace search results.\n\nFor instance, if you search up \"top nft marketplaces\", the first thing that'll come up is the Motley Fool suggesting marketplaces.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/61293oh79cc91.png?width=983&format=png&auto=webp&s=b75d3254376e4f5bd0625282dfb9f9e0bec4f397\n\nIt's not surprising they'll be trying to control where prospective NFT marketplace customers go when they want to shop for NFTs. And due to their conflict of interests, they'd most likely use their SEO to try to sway people away from the GameStop NFT marketplace.\n\nTake this as a sign, however, that they genuinely find the GameStop NFT marketplace threatening, and with good reason, as the marketplace has the best chance of dominating the NFT Market and producing exceptional returns, which would undermine the extremely negative MSM sentiment against GME.\n\nMoreover, in addition to the GameStop NFT marketplace still being in Beta Stage, the potentially insanely large partnerships with blue chip companies have yet to be revealed:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7rtn0ck99cc91.png?width=777&format=png&auto=webp&s=77bc30f22c69e31de71c9795a3fe26f47f0372bb\n\n**\u00a74:GME as a Store of Value**\n\nTo better understand why GME is an excellent store of value, let's start with the quantity theory of money, which demonstrates the relationships between prices and monetary policy.\n\nQuantity theory of money: MV = PY , where\n\nM = money supply\n\nV = velocity of money\n\nP = price level\n\nY = aggregate output (aka real GDP)\n\nWe can rearrange the formula to isolate P & get: P= (MV)/Y, which shows us that (in theory) if GDP falls, the price level should increase (inflation). This doesn't always work in practice, however, as we've seen historically with recessions in the U.S being concurrent with deflationary periods. This is because there's a variety of variables at play. In theory, inflation should happen during a recession, as when output drops, so does supply, and if demand stays the same, should trigger price increases/inflation. Though, a lot of the times consumption decreases during recessions, which ultimately negates that premise.\n\nIn the case of 2022, however, as GDP drops, inflation is also rising, and it's only going to be getting worse, because in this instance, consumption doesn't actually decrease, but increases. We never saw the full effects quantitative easing had on the economy, because a lot of that stimulus money was invested in the market; hence, it never found its way in circulation with the money supply. But as the GDP drops and the stock market tanks, retail investors that didn't invest in the basket stocks, but instead invested in index funds, etc., will pull out that money from the market and most likely end up using it after storing the money for so long. According to a [survey with a 1,500 sample size conducted by Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2021/06/27/46-of-people-invested-their-stimulus-checks-in-the-stock-market/?sh=47e3cc4272f0), 46% of stimulus check recipients invested at least some of their stimulus checks. And, according to [The Economist](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/05/26/stimulus-cheques-have-buoyed-americas-stockmarket), 10-15% of stimulus money was immediately invested in the stock market upon receiving it. Also, a [significant amount](https://www.commondreams.org/views/2020/04/06/wall-street-wins-again-bailouts-time-coronavirus) of the $9 trillion stimulus injection went to bailing out Wall Street. So, as these overleveraged institutions deleverage, and as the recession continues, the stock market drops, and retail investors continue selling their index funds, most of that money will pour into the current circulating money supply and massively contribute to the ongoing inflation rate increase.\n\nThis is the current inflation rate \\[[source](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/current-inflation-rates/#:~:text=The%20last%20column%2C%20%E2%80%9CAve%2C,year's%20actual%20rate%20of%20inflation)\\]:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rxqro7gb9cc91.png?width=533&format=png&auto=webp&s=3736eaf46685cf92ff3dced0e7e54fa859269c34\n\nDue note that the current inflation rates are measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Policymakers at the Federal Reserve monitor inflation and use it when determining monetary policy, even though the CPI is inaccurate and most likely being understated. For example, the CPI doesn't take into account consumer spending shifts from assumed rates in the market basket, which they most likely have shifted (as per my previous explanation on investor stimulus checks and the GDP).\n\nRegardless, even if we go by CPI, at this rate it's detrimental to the value of the dollar. The deterioration of the USD that the Fed has failed to mitigate is only becoming a nightmare on a macroeconomic level.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/bpa2qler9cc91.gif\n\nWhat has been the Fed's response? Rate hikes.\n\nThe theory of liquidity preference demonstrates the relationship between supply and demand for real money balances, as well as the interest rates. The quantity of money demanded is dependent on the interest rate.\n\n[isoquant demonstrating change in money demanded depending on interest rate.](https://preview.redd.it/z4rthged9cc91.png?width=397&format=png&auto=webp&s=69fb1ffd8973f255856cb87d365e386572f01e03)\n\nErgo, Fed's open market operations raise interest rates  \u21d2 quantity of money demanded drops \u21d2 inflation becomes less unstable (in theory). Nevertheless, considering the extent of quantitative easing from the Fed in the past years, as well as the current state of the market, extreme measures would have to be taken to lower the high inflation rates. The current rate hikes have not been enough.\n\nWhere does GameStop come into play?\n\nUnlike the dollar, GME has a cap of about 76 million outstanding shares (about 304 million when adjusted post-split). And considering the fact that GameStop has virtually no debt and a solid $1 billion cash on hand, I see no probability of dilution in the future.\n\nThe Fed printing trillions of dollars is currency dilution, similar to share dilution.\n\nHence, if the USD is being actively diluted but GME won't be in the foreseeable future, GME is a safeguard against USD inflation. Yes, there are synthetic GME shares floating around, but they *must* be bought back\u2014for this reason, GME is not only a safe haven asset against inflation, but a generational wealth creating machine, due to the inevitable MOASS upon the closing of synthetics (& ultimately all short positions).\n\nAnother significant reason as to why GME is a safe haven asset is because it's a hedge against a market crash. When overleveraged firms start getting liquidated and the market tanks, a variety of outcomes can take place, but they all lead to the benefit of GME, as opposed to the rest of the market.\n\nFor one, in the event of a market crash, GME would likely first drop in tandem with the market, only to finally take off in the opposite direction once shorts start closing their positions, due to failed margin calls.\n\nIn the event that GME were to drop in tandem with the market crash, but there were somehow no failed margin calls for SHFs (unlikely), GME couldn't drop as hard as the market, lest SHFs let GME enter critical float lock levels.\n\nThe graph below from my DD \"[SHFs Can & Will Get Margin Called](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/vrwfjt/shfs_can_will_get_margin_called/)\", illustrates both critical levels that SHFs need to avoid GME from entering:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m41mrz5i9cc91.png?width=1440&format=png&auto=webp&s=07a6082d45024e569f6b467ac258b69c1a884851\n\nWhether it be the spike in credit default swaps or unprecedented records of margin debt to be the initiating factor in this market crash, the market would have a long way to go before bottoming out. And although the market can create unprecedented troughs, GME can't. There's a hard limit to how much GME can drop. If GME drops to critical float lock levels, the float would get locked within a few months maximum (if not a few weeks). And this is assuming GameStop & RC don't instantly lock the float themselves (or at least expedite it), as a GME price in critical float lock levels would technically be low enough for them to finish the float lock. It would be a catalyst for MOASS either way.\n\nRegardless of what happens, GME is the biggest safe haven asset during a market crash. The crypto market will crash along with the stock market, as hedge funds have been and are [still](https://www.wsj.com/articles/mainstream-hedge-funds-pour-billions-of-dollars-into-crypto-11646808223) heavily invested in Bitcoin/altcoins. The primary reason the major cryptocurrencies generally move in tandem is because institutions trade them in an etf basket, similar with \"meme stocks\", but I digress.\n\nCrypto will not be safe during a market crash, neither will real estate, or commodities.\n\nGME is not only shielded from inflation, but also a market crash. Regardless of how the stock market crash plays out, every outcome leads to GME being on top, and MOASS inevitably initiating.\n\nApes can rest comfortably knowing they are shielded from adverse macroeconomic events. Others, however, may not realize GME is an ark in a sea of red until it's too late.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/w1k24prk9cc91.gif\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAdditional Citations:\n\nHassani, Ashkan. *Applications of Cobb-Douglas Production Function in Construction Time-Cost Analysis*.

                ">SHFs can combine covered calls and married puts to create a synthetic share (see Fidelity's webinar presentation on synthetics for further details).\n\nThis is a fundamental misunderstanding of how synthetic short positions work. **Synthetic short positions =/= synthetic shares.** Your example has nothing to do with synthetic shares, only synthetic short/long positions that are facilitated through options trading. **In reality, a** ***synthetic position*** **is just a way to measure the activity of an investment strategy relative to the thing it's trying to emulate.**\n\nA synthetic short instrument emulates the behavior of an actual short position by subbing out borrow fees and shares with options premiums and exercisable contracts, but until contracts are exercised, there is no actual trading of shares going on.\n\n**A covered call + married put simply means you already own XXX shares and are writing OTM calls and purchasing ATM puts.** This allows you to a) sell the call and profit off of the premium paid, hoping it will expire worthless, and b) protect your existing investment with puts by locking in a sell price ATM - if the stock dips in price, you can exercise your put contract to sell your XXX shares at a more ideal price.\n\nLet's say you have the call contract move against you and the buyer exercises. You're forced to use your existing XXX shares to facilitate the trade (hence why it's a *covered call*). As the writer of the call contract, you are selling your shares at an agreed upon price to the buyer of the call contract. If you wanted to still exercise your put contract later, you'd still be responsible for locating (buying) another 100 shares to sell. As the buyer of the put contract, you are exercising the contract to sell 100 shares and the writer is responsible for purchasing them from you. You're technically shorting the stock by creating a trade that requires borrowing and settling of shares, albeit subbing borrow fees for options premiums.\n\nAt no point is anyone creating shares - that business happens through shady accounting of contracts at the macro level, but we have no reason to believe synthetic short positions are creating shares. Synthetic positions are simply an expensive way of hedging investments and offsetting losses. You can use them to buy time and shift investment strategies, but at the end of the day you're still responsible for locating shares for any exercised contracts.",

And you know it somewhere deep inside that little brain of yours.**\n\n**The fact that you only dare to say this stupid shit after you've blocked any reply is all the evidence really required to know that you know you're full of shit.**\n\n**You unblocked me only to draft this stupid fucking reply and then you re-blocked me.**\n\nI don't want to opine on your assumptions about GameStop, but I would say that this is perhaps the most incorrect, wrongest, least right utilization of several of those economic concepts that I have ever in my life imagined was even possible, much less seen for myself.\n\nI have never seen anyone, anywhere or in any context try so hard and fail so hard at using economic concepts they clearly just don't understand.\n\nIt would take a lot to completely untangle all of this, but I just want to touch on your Cobb Douglas thing because it's particularly egregious and emblematic of the kind of inaccuracy elsewhere in this. \n\n-----\n\nThat is not what the Cobb Douglas function is or how it's used or what it means.\n\nCobb Douglas is fairly abstract, highly theoretical, and almost exclusively used in academia for micro/macro analysis - rarely in practice as it's not empirically proven and again it's highly abstract. It furthermore won't determine profitability or growth, its real theoretical PRACTICAL application is to identify the optimal mix or balance between production inputs.\n\nYou've disguised a completely nonsensical use / application of that math behind words and terms people here simple don't understand.\n\nI can't really begin to untangle the mess of errors and ignorance in your use of this equation - *and my own criticism is fucked anyways because I'm trying warp a sensical explanation out of a completely illogical and irrational application of this function* - but just some examples of how you've butchered that math and the application of that function...\n\n- Capital in Cobb Douglas is typically physical capital, like machine hours. Labor is typically in hours too. It's an input, trying to measure a quantified output from quantified inputs. \n\n- You don't simply \"pick\" or spitball coefficients and values in the production function if you're trying to extract some real world insight, those are typically derived through regression on a set of observed data... Or otherwise observed empirically. If you do \"pick\", then it's simply a theoretical exercise using a production formula that's not empirical. You get what you put in, in which case it's pretty meaningless.\n\n- Cash on hand has no relevance to capital in the cobb-douglas production function. The capital in that case wouldn't be financial capital, but if if was, it would be capital invested in some project or business from which an output of some kind could be observed (which again, you've skipped over). An increase in cash on hand is actually money that's NOT invested, and increase in it will not have any implications for productivity or margin in this case.\n\n- What do you think productivity is? What is produced? Are you looking for revenue? Margin? Cash flow? Units sold? Services rendered? This stems from the last point, but again this math should be derived from a dataset where productive output is defined, otherwise you get these weird, completely nonsensical results. GameStop is currently losing hundreds of millions of dollars a year - in margin and free cash flow for example. \n\n- Just look at it empirically, GameStop ploughed hundreds of millions of the $1.6B they raised from their public offering into the company over the last year and their cash flow and profit margins actually DECLINED. So clearly your conclusions from this butchered use of a production function aren't sensical. Part of the problem here is because CD is only really useful practically when analyzing a fairly compact and isolated productive activity - or an an extremely abstract level. Many different things are spent on / invested in in a large company, there are hundreds of production functions depending on how you cut the company up.\n\nIf you knew what you were doing, an easier and more sensical way of doing what you're TRYING to do here would be to use an ROE, ROA, ROIC or similar metric to estimate what GameStop would return from their cash if invested. But those numbers are negative, so maybe it's good that you didn't.\n\n-----\n\nOther than that. Your application of simplistic supply and demand concepts is nonsensical. \n\nAnd your understanding of QTM is incredibly wrong as are your assumptions for the implications for GME from economic downturn.",

Why? Workers are commodites like any other. They have price. The price is their salary. The bigger the supply of workers is =  the price falls more and more. If price falls it means their salaries fall. If salaries fall, the costs fall = profits rise up.**\n\nRate of natural increase in the US has been falling for decades. Decades. It was 3,65% in the 60s, it's 1,6% now. All of that puts the supply at risk. Putting supply at risk, it puts... *profits* at risk.\n\n**THIS IS NOT A DISTRACTION. IT IS ONE OF THE THINGS THE CLASS OF OWNERS IS WILLING TO DO IN ORDER FOR THEM TO KEEP THEIR FUCKING PROFITS**\n\n**THEY WILL LITERALLY USE FORCE TO SAVE THEIR MONEY, AT YOUR EXPENSE - BY TELLING YOU TO FORCE-BIRTH.**\n\nSources? As for rate of natural increase in the US throughout the years - bloody Google.\nAs for the theory - Karl Marx - Das Kapital. Haha\n\n**Last edit regarding immigrants** (in regards to overabundance of workers): you ask why they didn't legalize immigrants from central America coming in. Here's why: because illegal immigrants are **greatly cheaper** than legal ones. It is cheap, desperate and scared labour with no rights and no protection from the state whatsoever - i.e \"perfect\" workers. Do you realize how much money would they lost had you legalized these immigrants? How many rights you would have to grant them? Without those rights, they are much easier to exploit. When they are considered illegal - they become modern-day slaves. Take every job, any job, with any salary - just to not get deported. They are extremely profitable.\nAnd they will keep coming in:\nSource: h ttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/washington-secrets/even-more-illegal-migrants-expected-in-2022-record-2-1-million%3f_amp=true\n\n/Sorry for any grammar errors or any other mistakes I've made here. I'm from Poland. By the way, we had the same issue over here. Those fucks came with the ban literally a year after it was made public that the program of goverment-help for families to increase natural increase failed miserably. A whole nation went to protests. Obviously it didn't change shit. Words, screaming and yelling are not going to change their minds when it comes to millions of dollars every year. Hope you won't let them avoid the consequences.\n\n/in the title: its essence* lmao",

                "The following submission statement was provided by /u/chrisdh79:\n\n---\n\nFrom the article: Particularly in developing countries, internet access can make the difference between people receiving an education, staying healthy, finding a home, and securing employment \u2013 or not.\n\nEven if people have offline opportunities, such as accessing social security schemes or finding housing, they are at a comparative disadvantage to those with Internet access.\n\nPublishing his [findings](http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1470594X231167597) today in Politics, Philosophy & Economics, Dr Merten Reglitz, Lecturer in Global Ethics at the University of Birmingham, calls for a standalone human right to internet access \u2013 based on it being a practical necessity for a range of socio-economic human rights.\n\nHe calls for public authorities to provide internet access free of charge for those unable to afford it, as well as providing training in basic digital skills training for all citizens and protecting online access from arbitrary interference by states and private companies.\n\nDr Reglitz\u2019s research also highlights similar problems for people without internet access in developing countries \u2013 for example, 20 per cent of children aged 6 to 11 are out of school in sub-Saharan Africa. Many children face long walks to their schools, where class sizes are routinely very large in crumbling, unsanitary schools with insufficient numbers of teachers.\n\nHowever, online education tools can make a significant difference - allowing children living remotely from schools to complete their education. More students can be taught more effectively if teaching materials are available digitally and pupils do not have to share books.\n\nFor people in developing countries, internet access can also make the difference between receiving an adequate level of healthcare or receiving none. Digital health tools can help diagnose illnesses \u2013 for example, in Kenya, a smartphone-based Portable Eye Examination Kit (Peek) has been used to test people\u2019s eyesight and identify people who need treatment, especially in remote areas underserved by medical practitioners.\n\n---\n\n Please reply to OP's comment here: https://old.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/12ep0er/people_around_the_globe_are_so_dependent_on_the/jfbu2jx/",
                "I can speak as someone who suffers from a chronic disability with flair ups; I would not have a job or independence without the internet. \n\nSpecifically work from home has allowed me a quality of life I didn't think would be possible when I was in school. I went from barely scraping by in high school, to not being an honors student in college but passing all my classes and having a decent 3.2 GPA while taking very challenging courses because so much of the work could be done or made up online, to having a full time job with benefits now. \n\nI would certainly be on disability pay like my mother, which is a piddling amount, and would likely be moved back in with my folks. But now from both a personal benefits viewpoint and economical one, I'm providing for myself, putting money back into the economy and am stable. \n\nI understand the internet is seen as a luxury for many people, and especially work from home is often seen as a simple convenience for some workers, but I would urge people to consider people like me who can still provide for themselves under work from home and who can still have social lives because of what the internet provides us.

                "From the article: Particularly in developing countries, internet access can make the difference between people receiving an education, staying healthy, finding a home, and securing employment \u2013 or not.\n\nEven if people have offline opportunities, such as accessing social security schemes or finding housing, they are at a comparative disadvantage to those with Internet access.\n\nPublishing his [findings](http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1470594X231167597) today in Politics, Philosophy & Economics, Dr Merten Reglitz, Lecturer in Global Ethics at the University of Birmingham, calls for a standalone human right to internet access \u2013 based on it being a practical necessity for a range of socio-economic human rights.\n\nHe calls for public authorities to provide internet access free of charge for those unable to afford it, as well as providing training in basic digital skills training for all citizens and protecting online access from arbitrary interference by states and private companies.\n\nDr Reglitz\u2019s research also highlights similar problems for people without internet access in developing countries \u2013 for example, 20 per cent of children aged 6 to 11 are out of school in sub-Saharan Africa. Many children face long walks to their schools, where class sizes are routinely very large in crumbling, unsanitary schools with insufficient numbers of teachers.\n\nHowever, online education tools can make a significant difference - allowing children living remotely from schools to complete their education. More students can be taught more effectively if teaching materials are available digitally and pupils do not have to share books.\n\nFor people in developing countries, internet access can also make the difference between receiving an adequate level of healthcare or receiving none. Digital health tools can help diagnose illnesses \u2013 for example, in Kenya, a smartphone-based Portable Eye Examination Kit (Peek) has been used to test people\u2019s eyesight and identify people who need treatment, especially in remote areas underserved by medical practitioners.",

Especially considering how technology gets cheaper so if you can only run NES games now, you can probably shift up to PS2 in a few years for a very reasonable outlay.\n\nI think a lot of people will be working through their backlogs in the coming years as the price of titles goes up, the price of hardware goes up (for new titles), the price of groceries goes up and the take home pay goes ~~up~~ down.",

            "selftext": "For the past year, we\u2019ve placed a lot of focus on attacking Citadel and other short hedge funds that have participated in fraudulent and corrupt activity. While our anger is not misdirected, these institutions are just a bunch of Goombas compared to the Federal Reserve.\n\n**The Federal Reserve is the Final  Boss**\n\nThis post is intended to help people understand the role of the Federal Reserve, in detail, and how its actions have destroyed the United States economy, specifically in the past decade.\n\nTo this day, there is an ongoing debate over whether or not the actions of the Federal Reserve were made with good intent or if their objective has always been to help the rich get richer, and I\u2019ll leave it to readers to decide for themselves. However, whichever scenario you believe, it\u2019s not hard to argue that the outcome of the Fed\u2019s intervention is doing significantly more harm than good, and the result has created the largest disconnect we\u2019ve ever experienced between Main Street and Wall Street.\n\nEconomic intervention by the Feds, since 2008, has not only further fueled Wall Street\u2019s greed, caused significant inflation, and widened the wealth gap, it\u2019s also responsible for the extreme wage/income equality and has completely broken our labor market.\n\n**We\u2019re Living Through an Experiment Run By the Federal Reserve**\n\nNot enough people understand that the tools the Fed has implemented (quantitative easing, reverse repos, etc.) are new to our monetary policy strategy and we're living through an epic experiment that is going terribly wrong.\n\nFed officials pat themselves on the back for their response to 2008 and have continued to confidently report positively on the current health status of our economy, but the experiment has been dramatically changing the American economy. With every passing day, the problem just keeps getting worse and no one knows how severe the final outcome will be.\n\n**The Fed\u2019s New, Post Crash Strategy**\n\nUp until 2008, the Federal Reserve\u2019s primary responsibility was to manage and improve the unemployment rate and stabilize inflation, mainly by raising and lowering short-term interest rates.\n\nFollowing the crash, they started taking extra steps to help navigate through the crisis and limit widespread poverty. They began by doing something that hadn't been done in decades \u2014 They began dropping interest rates, eventually to almost zero.\n\nUnfortunately, the massive rate cuts did not stimulate the economy as they were intended to (I'll get into why later.) So, with Americans still suffering, and the banking system on the verge of collapse, Fed officials decided to go even further.\n\nA committee within the Federal Reserve came up with another tool to help stimulate the economy called quantitative easing. QE was promoted under Ben Bernanke, the Fed Chairman at the time, and was an experimental way for the Fed to inject money into the financial system and lower long-term interest rates. The hope was that the lower rates would encourage more spending and borrowing throughout the economy.\n\nIn the midst of the next great depression, this would become known as the largest market intervention in world history and had never been attempted before.\n\nThe way they did it was to literally create new money. They used the money to purchase huge amounts of mortgage back securities and government debt, among other things, from banks and other institutions. Almost immediately the Fed started purchasing more than a trillion dollars worth of mortgage bonds from the banks, as quickly as possible. The idea was to get more credit and cheaper credit into the hands of the American people.\n\nBy making money so inexpensive, and making it abundant, cheap, and easy to get, they flooded the market with trillions of dollars of easy money. In theory, the expectation was that the low-interest rates and QE would have a strong positive effect on the wider economy. However, in practice, it was much less successful moving the economy.\n\n**The Negative Effects of Intervention By the Fed**\n\nAll the easy money sparked a rally in the stock market straight away, and at the time, the plan was viewed as a success. However, there were major issues looming that had not yet come to light.\n\nOne issue was that easy money essentially emboldened investors to take bigger risks. The rally was no accident. By design the QE program effectively lowered long-term interest rates, making safer investments, like bonds less attractive, and riskier assets like stocks, more attractive.\n\nAnother main problem was that the banks were hoarding the cash, instead of making it available to borrowers.\n\nWhat was playing out in practice is very different than how they theorized it would go. Insiders began to worry their tools weren\u2019t helping the American people like they originally believed.\n\nWhile the intervention may have been necessary to help stabilize the economy after the crash, it was becoming clear there was a fundamental problem with the approach, in that the tools the Fed used worked through the Wall Street banks. For that reason, the tools were benefitting the wrong people - the people who didn't really need the help.\n\nThe Fed became at the mercy of Wall Street, and insiders had hoped Congress would interject to help correct the imbalance by targeting more money to Main Street and the wider economy. However, before that was able to happen, politics took a sharp turn.\n\nRepublicans won back the House by gaining 63 seats in a major shift, with dozens of tea party-backed newcomers joining the GOP caucus. This significantly slowed any progress in Congress and the White House working together to stimulate the economy.\n\n**The Fed Was on its Own**\n\nAfter the midterm elections, the Fed announced it would do another round of QE, despite the warning signs. They claim they did so not just to stabilize the economy, but to boost it as well.\n\nBernanke believed it would create a more virtuous circle, lower mortgage rates, make housing more affordable, and higher stock prices to boost consumer wealth. He promoted the plan aggressively and did many interviews to fight the critics who were worried it would increase inflation.\n\nMany critics believed that while the Fed was doing some good, there were greater concerns. The main concern was that the program was trickle-down economics, which would lead to an enormous increase in wealth inequality. We had already been seeing wealth inequality growing[ ](http://faster.si/?ce)faster since the 1970s, and this plan basically put that on steroids.\n\nThere became a rising demand for money from Wall Street. The sentiment was that the sky was going to fall if the Fed stopped printing more. Yet, no one could provide proof or an explanation that showering Wall Street with trillions of dollars was directly benefiting the average American. That was because it wasn\u2019t.\n\nWith Wall Street and the government addicted to Free money, the Fed kept money flowing in multiple rounds of QE, injecting more than $2 trillion into the financial system. By 2013 unemployment was continuing to fall and there were signs that its policies were having a positive effect, so the Fed chairman announced that they would gradually begin tapering QE.\n\nThe announcement immediately caused the markets to drop significantly, in an event known as the \"Taper Tantrum,\u201d which put the Fed in a difficult position. Bernate had no other choice than to backpedal his announcement to taper.\n\nLuckily, the following year, Janet Yellen was able to successfully pause QE without disrupting the markets.\n\nThis was also around the time we started ramping up the use of reverse repos. Have you ever looked at the chart and wondered why the reverse repo seemed like a big deal when in the first spike during the 2008 crash, at the beginning of the pandemic, and right now, but for some reason, those spikes from 2013-2018 don't seem like such a big deal? My guess is that **it was a very big deal** and completely necessary to prop up the market after the printer was turned off. But just something to think about.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xmm6mfyk6ve81.png?width=650&format=png&auto=webp&s=d791112bbac99010371c69f9ed7b4f0c6eacb71d\n\nTo prevent the market from crashing, she also promised to maintain the Fed's massive balance sheet of assets it had bought and keep interest rates low.\n\nUnfortunately, low rates were also causing massive issues in the economy and one of the reasons we\u2019re now seeing movements like the Anti-Werk subreddit.\n\n**Low-Interest Rates and the Negative Impact**\n\nBy 2018 it was believed that the economy was in a good place, citing historically low unemployment numbers and the fact that concerns about inflation hadn't materialized, and there was a growing debate of whether or not the Fed should increase interest rates and reduce the flow of easy money.\n\nAt this point, income equality became an obvious flaw in the plan. The gap between the rich and poor had grown excessively and coming out of this \u201cgood place,\" the 1% held 32% of the nation's wealth.\n\nEven though unemployment was very low, the majority of Americans began to feel the pain of the Fed\u2019s intervention. Most people had less than $400 in savings, which put Main Street in an extremely fragile position.\n\nIt eventually became abundantly clear that what the Fed was doing still wasn't working. Keeping rates low didn't raise growth, it raised markets, and the wealthy are the ones who owned stock.\n\nCritics were also worried that low rates and access to easy money were causing distressing trends in Wall Street and in corporate America. One issue, in particular, was the amount of corporate borrowing. Low rates incentivized institutions to borrow more and companies were doing so, in record amounts. The Federal Government even took advantage of these rates and ran the national debt up into new highs.\n\nTaking advantage of low rates, corporations were selling bonds to big investors. The extent of the debt was massive. Companies became so overleveraged, their credit ratings plummeted.\n\nThe Fed had hoped that companies would put all that borrowed money to good use. Traditionally, low rates prompted businesses to invest in their workforce and their infrastructure, but this time around it was playing out very differently.\n\nCompanies began borrowing money to buy back their own stock, making the remaining shares more valuable and prices higher. And instead of borrowing money to hire more workers or put more machines in more factories, businesses were using that money to invest in technology that will *eliminate* workers and reduce employee headcount. They also used that money to give CEOs and other corporate officers bonuses.\n\nCompanies would eventually issue more debt and buy back more stock, creating an endless cycle to increase the stock price, rather than improve the actual company. Since the 2018 crash, more than $600 billion has been used for stock buybacks.\n\nIt is hard to penalize the actual companies doing this because the Fed was making it so ridiculously easy. Actually taking the steps to innovate and improve a company can be difficult for any company, but what isn\u2019t difficult is issuing debt and paying it out to your shareholders, and increasing the stock price. The problem is that that doesn't create real wealth or improve the company, and it certainly doesn't improve the labor market in any way. So, low rates eventually become a drag on our economic wealth, not a benefit.\n\n**The Fed\u2019s Intentions Under a Microscope**\n\nThe idea that the Fed may just be boosting financial markets and helping Wall Street has become harder and harder to deny. There is a lot of debate on how much the Fed actually helped Main Street at all, at any point. What most people do agree on is that, regardless of their intention, the Fed\u2019s actions grew the wealth of the financial sector enormously.\n\nThere is one main problem with that. Although collectively the financial sector fulfills a necessary service, they do not provide much in return for the wealth they\u2019ve been unevenly accumulating. They do not generate products or services and do not generate any real increase in income. Their profits are made by creating more convoluted, expensive financial instruments. They are essentially leeches on the American economy, now sucking out more than double the amount that they were before the Fed\u2019s intervention.\n\nThe way the banking system works is no accident either, by the way. It has taken a lot of manipulation and lobbying in Congress to get to where it is today.\n\n**Where the Most Risks Lie**\n\nAs the banking system grew, so did the risks. The amount of debt companies acquired became an increasingly dangerous liability, in the event of a downturn. There were also increasing warnings from a certain sector of financial companies that had been flourishing in the easy money economy, known as Shadow Banking.\n\nFormer US Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke provided the following definition in November 2013:\n\n*\"Shadow banking, as usually defined, comprises a diverse set of institutions and markets that, collectively, carry out traditional banking functions\u2014but do so outside, or in ways only loosely linked to, the traditional system of regulated depository institutions. Examples of important components of the shadow banking system include securitization vehicles, asset-backed commercial paper conduits, money market funds, markets for repurchase agreements, investment banks, and mortgage companies\"*\n\nThe core of the problem in shadow banks is they\u2019re extremely fragile. Shadow institutions are not subject to the same prudential regulations as depository banks so that they do not have to keep as high financial reserves relative to their market exposure. Thus they can have a very high level of financial leverage, with a high ratio of debt relative to the liquid assets available to pay immediate claims. High leverage magnifies profits during boom periods and losses during downturns.\n\nAnyone who is an investor, who has their money in a shadow bank, and not a real bank is going to have an incentive to withdraw in the face of any uncertainty, so little economic shocks that cause prices to fall have the potential to trigger runs. Allowing these to develop, we've inserted a sense of instability into our economic system that doesn't need to be there and that has great, negative potential.\n\nThis instability is still on the Fed's radar today. Before the pandemic, in response to the risk shadow banks pose to our economy, Jerome Powell stated the Financial Stability Council is working on a solution and is looking carefully at leveraged lending, as they are aware that the situation requires serious monitoring. However, despite those concerns, little action has been taken by other regulators or Congress, so the system remains vulnerable to shock.\n\nThey have been implicated as significantly contributing to the global financial crisis of 2007\u20132012. And this is probably why (copied from Wikipedia):\n\n*The shadow banking system also conducts an enormous amount of trading activity in the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives market, which grew rapidly in the decade up to the 2008 financial crisis, reaching over US$650 trillion in notional contracts traded. This rapid growth mainly arose from credit derivatives. In particular, these include:*\n\n* *interest rate obligations derived from bundles of mortgage securities*\n* *collateralized debt obligations (CDO)*\n* *credit default swaps (CDS), a form of insurance against the default risk inherent in the assets underlying a CDO; and*\n* *a variety of customized innovations on the CDO model, collectively known as synthetic CDOs*\n\n*The market in CDS, for example, was insignificant in 2004 but rose to over $60 trillion in a few years.* *Because credit default swaps were not regulated as insurance contracts, companies selling them were not required to maintain sufficient capital reserves to pay potential claims. Demands for settlement of hundreds of billions of dollars of credit default swaps contracts issued by AIG, the largest insurance company in the world, led to its financial collapse. Despite the prevalence and volume of this activity, it attracted little outside attention before 2007, and much of it was off the balance sheets of the contracting parties' affiliated banks. The uncertainty this created among counterparties contributed to the deterioration of credit conditions.*\n\n*Since then the shadow banking system has been blamed for aggravating the subprime mortgage crisis and helping to transform it into a global credit crunch.*\n\n**The Pandemic**\n\nWhen the pandemic began, people started pulling their money out of the markets causing the U.S. economy to go into free fall.\n\nAlthough COVID-19 hit the global economy hard and fast, it wasn't just the pandemic that was causing a financial crisis. It was the vulnerabilities of a now highly leveraged financial system that was mainly to blame for the failure. The pandemic launched a full-on panic in the shadow banking system.\n\nThe Fed, again, sprang into action. They turned the money printing machine back on, buying hundreds and billions in debt from financial institutions. By mid-March, they made more than a trillion dollars available to the Shadow banks and they cut interest rates back down to $0. The Fed also:\n\n* Gave half a trillion dollars to foreign central banks\n* Lent half a trillion to securities dealers\n* Bought $2 trillion of Treasuries securities\n* Bought another $ trillion in mortgage back securities\n* And flooded the zone with new government cash, to stabilize the system.\n\nBut it wasn't enough to stop the panic.\n\nThe corporate debt market had frozen up and companies were unable to finance themselves, putting the wider financial system at risk.\n\nSo, on March 23rd, 2020 the Fed took its economic experiment to a whole new level. With Congress backing the plan, Powell announced a range of new loan programs. For the first time, the Fed would be willing to buy up a massive amount of corporate debt. **This was huge.** It basically proved the Fed was willing to do whatever it takes to prevent Wall Street and Corporate America from failing.\n\nBy the end of March, Congress also passed the largest economic stimulus bill ever. The aim of the $2.2 trillion CARES Act was to provide support for individuals and small businesses.\n\nA big portion of the bill, over a trillion dollars, was earmarked for the Fed's lending programs. But in trying to keep workers employed and companies afloat, the Fed had also used its power to rescue some of the riskiest parts of the financial system \u2014 the junk bond market.\n\nTo the critics, the Fed was sending the wrong message and rewarding the wrong people.\n\n**The U.S. Economy is No Longer a Free Market**\n\nOver the years, Wall Street has been trained to believe the Fed is on its side. If they win \u2014 they keep the profits. If they lose, the Fed will bend every effort and use every dollar they have to bail them out.\n\nThis completely undercuts how the Free market is supposed to work.\n\nThis idea is a moral hazard. If Wall Street believes the government and the Fed will bail them out whenever there is trouble, there is no downside to risky behavior. Because if there was a problem, the consequences wouldn't fall on them. And if they made insanely aggressive and risky bets, they would be able to keep the profits. Risk-taking is being rewarded.\n\nAnd now the Fed isn\u2019t just stepping into bailout Wall Street, they are stepping into bailout corporate America.\n\nThis is the biggest threat of capitalism. If companies make money in the good times, and the Fed steps in during the bad times it creates a never-ending cycle, and the markets never correct. It's like a no-lose casino.\n\nIn the time since the Pandemic began, corporate America has taken on more debt, the housing market and the millions of people who own stocks and bonds are seeing an extreme bull market, and the richest Americans have grown their own wealth by $1.3 trillion.\n\n**The Current State of the Market**\n\nFundamentals have stopped mattering. What we're experiencing now is mania, because the Fed has put the floor underneath asset prices. Most retail traders believe there is only one direction things could go, and that's up.\n\nMania is a very dangerous phase. Because the Fed is pumping asset prices so high, it's impossible to actually gauge the real price of a company. They're basically creating an illusion.\n\nSooner or later it's all going to come down. The fact that the stock market, housing market, and the bond market are all approaching bubble territory at the same time, means when it does come down, it will be a complete and utter disaster.\n\n**Food For thought**\n\nThis has all occurred under 4 different presidents. It kind of makes ongoing political arguments that have been heating up in recent years seem somewhat irrelevant. Democracy is an illusion. Our government is owned by the Federal Reserve; It doesn\u2019t matter which side of the aisle you\u2019re on, the agenda is the same.\n\n**So, in conclusion, buy, hold, and DRS until we bring down the Federal Reserve.**\n\n**TL;DR:** A breakdown of how the Fed\u2019s actions have destroyed the American Economy in the past decade. Economic intervention by the Feds, in the past decade, has fueled Wall Street\u2019s greed, caused significant inflation, widened income and wealth gaps, and is responsible for a completely broken labor market (among other problems) - All to help the rich get richer. The new tools the Fed has utilized in the past decade (quantitative easing, reverse repos, etc.) are all part of a literal experiment gone terribly wrong. And with every passing day, the problem just keeps getting worse.",

                ">When Silicon Valley Bank went bust earlier this month, Republicans pounced. The bank, which quickly received assistance from the federal government, was \u201ctoo woke to fail,\u201d according to Missouri Senator Josh Hawley. The brahmins at The Wall Street Journal editorial board also suspected that wokeness was what led the bank to fail: They fretted that the bank may \u201chave been distracted by diversity demands\u201d\u2014that is to say, that there were too many women, minorities, and \u2026 for some reason, veterans on the board to adequately measure financial risk. Florida governor and pudding enthusiast Ron DeSantis concurred, telling Fox News that the bank was too \u201cconcerned with \\[diversity, equity, and inclusion measures\\] and politics and all kinds of stuff\u201d that distracted from its \u201ccore mission.\u201d  \nNaturally, none of that was true: SVB\u2019s failure was the result of high interest rates, depositor growth, and an old-fashioned bank run, not diversity measures. The GOP\u2019s response was nevertheless revealing. Despite the fact that the markets were shaken by SVB\u2019s failures, leading to concerns about a wave of regional bank closings that could touch off a recession, Republicans shied away from talking about the economy in any material way. Instead, they stuck to their weird culture-war scripts.   \nThis should not be particularly surprising if you\u2019ve paid even an iota of attention to GOP politics over the past few years. The \u201cwoke agenda\u201d now dominates cable news\u2014anything will do, whether it\u2019s uproars about children reading books about gay penguins or gas stoves or conversations about whether spokescandies should be hot or not (the right-wing position, to be clear, is that spokescandies should be very sexually arousing). These oddball obsessions, which shrink to fit any or all news cycles, have quickly swallowed nearly every other area of the Republican policy apparatus. OK, a bank failed\u2014but was it woke? This is their response to everything now. No matter what story is leading the coverage, conservatives will fit the news peg into the woke-hole.   \nAs Democrats head into what will be a difficult election year\u2014they will be defending several vulnerable Senate seats and almost certainly running the oldest presidential candidate in American political history\u2014this tendency among conservatives is essentially an in-kind donation. Republicans simply don\u2019t have an economic message anymore. They\u2019ve given up on the hard stuff. It\u2019s Mr. Potato Head, diversity fearmongering, and the relative fuckability of M&M\u2019s all the way down.   \nWhat is especially odd about this is that Republican voters care about the economy\u2014very much so. A March CNN poll found that a third of GOP voters rated the economy as their number one policy issue when it came to selecting a presidential candidate. Only 7 percent chose issues relating to \u201cvalues, morals, and rights\u201d\u2014with only 1 percent picking \u201canti-woke\u201d as a matter of concern. This trend is broadly true of the entire electorate: Last month, Pew found that \u201cstrengthening the economy\u201d was far and away the most important issue to voters, with three-quarters of respondents saying it should be a top priority.   \n  \n>  \n>\\[...\\] Trump\u2019s protectionist economic policies have gained little traction within the party but they too point to a larger incoherence. The Republican Party once fully embraced free trade. Now it doesn\u2019t. But where its actual preferences lie\u2014beyond advancing policies that benefit large-scale corporations and the wealthy\u2014is still unclear. Railing against wokeness has become the last resort of a party that\u2019s forgotten how to engage with the economy in any material way. The media environment also plays a role. Anti-wokeness agitprop is what sells on Fox, so the network devotes hours of programming a day to whatever convoluted culture-war story it can concoct that day. Republicans have realized that stoking a panic over culture will get them plenty of screen time.   \n\n\nAn interesting observation, that the main issue is the economy to polled GOP voters while the bread and crises that Fox gives so as not to lose voters is \"woeness\", and one which Democrats could use to their advantage if they chose to do so. Although, I'm also thinking that this analysis misses the connective thread of things like white grievance/resentment, and party loyalty, in why GOP voters still go for the party even though it's pretty obvious they've not made the majority of voter's economic wellbeing a priority in so long.",

Many thoughts here are my opinion, and others can be speculative.\n\nI'm personally happy to see that there is a shift from GME DD to macro-economics DD. Because it provides a much wider insight into how the market is behaving, and how GME would **NOT** be the cause of a market crash. Everything has been a pressure cooker over the past decade, ready to burst, and the new DD provides insight on when things might go down.\n\nThe new DD also diverges from the expectations of things to shoot up in price every week, where everyone is watching T+21/T+35/Net Capital cycles. It gives a general \"MOASS will most likely occur when everything falls due to liquidation of defaulting Banks / Hedge Funds / Financial Institutions\".\n\nIt gives me peace of mind, because I do not watch for specific dates around GME to cause the surge. I watch the economy at the macro scale to understand when things could blow.\n\n**And to any skeptics - yes, it is possible that GME could never blow up. Do I think it will blow up? Sure I  do. But I encourage YOU to read this post, disregarding GME, and to instead understand what is going on with the economy on the macro scale.**\n\n**Even if the GME play is wrong in your eyes, it is good to understand how the economy could crash harder than it did in 2008. I don't care if you don't believe in GME.

Before We Begin: An Overview of Repo And Reverse Repo\n\nRepo and Reverse Repo might be a bit confusing. You probably saw on this subreddit or in news that the reverse repo market has been blowing up, and it's a bit concerning.\n\nIt's not too complicated if you just imagine it between two entities: the Federal Reserve and Banks.\n\nFor both Repo and Reverse Repo, it is an agreement between two parties for one of them to sell some security for a price, and they agree to buy that security back at a later date at a higher price based on some interest rate (usually). This is called a \"Repurchase Agreement\", where \"Repo\" is a standard \"Repurchase Agreement\" and the \"Reverse Repo\" is a \"Reverse Repurchase Agreement\", the inverse of a \"Repo\".\n\nThe length of these Repurchase Agreements can be various lengths. Such as overnight, one month, three month, etc.. But what we're seeing is **short-term** **overnight Reverse Repos**. The parties swap, and then the next trading day they swap back. **It is not a permanent extraction of the underlying security. It is an overnight swap. A permanent extraction comes from Quantitative Easing or Quantitative Tightening, both of which I will discuss later.**\n\n* **Repo (Repurchase Agreement)** \\- This is where the bank swaps collateral (such as US Treasuries) for cash. This is used when the banks have too much collateral and not enough cash, or when the banks want to generate profit off of giving loans to other parties in the repo market.\n* **Reverse Repo (Reverse Repurchase Agreement)** \\- This is where the bank swaps cash (liquidity) for collateral (such as US Treasuries). This is used when the banks have too much cash (liquidity) and not enough collateral. The main reason behind this behavior is to pump balance sheets for the night.\n\nBelow is a diagram I made which might make this more clear. It is between the Fed (left) and Banks (right):\n\n**Edit: I have a typo here. QT and QE should be flipped in the diagram. QT is permanent extraction of liquidity. QE is permanent extraction of collateral.**\n\n[Repo and QT Versus Reverse Repo and QE](https://preview.redd.it/ukum83cf2k671.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=99d4c612df82013aed06ff2b22621500a80071cf)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 2. Quantitative Easing Can-Kick of 2008, Slowly Draining Collateral From The Market\n\nNote: If you want an overview of what led to the 2008 crash, check out [my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o0scoy/the_bigger_short_how_2008_is_repeating_at_a_much/) which has a summary of the documentary \"Inside Job (2010)\". It also describes where we're probably headed based on SLR, the DTC, ICC, OCC, NSCC rules, and mortgage default protections expiring June 30th, 2021.\n\nZoom back in time to 2008. The economy took a massive dump due to Wall Street's abuse of derivatives and leverage. They created a bunch of toxic CDOs mostly consisting of [subprime Mortgages](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/subprimeloan.asp) to create an economic apocalyptic scenario around Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS). Everything was overleveraged and was a massive balloon of bets based on the performance of the MBS's.\n\nCurrently, there's evidence of Wall Street doing the same abuse of toxic CDO's but this time with Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities (CMBS). \\[See above linked post for this detail\\]\n\nThe economy was hurting pretty bad from the 2008 crash, and it was going to continue going into a complete death spiral until the Federal Reserve (Fed) introduced Quantitative Easing (QE):\n\n>The Fed announced QE1 on November 25, 2008.\u00a0Fed Chairman\u00a0Ben Bernanke announced an aggressive attack on the\u00a0financial crisis of 2008. **The Fed began buying $500 billion in mortgage-backed securities\u00a0and $100 billion in other debt**. QE supported the housing market that the subprime mortgage crisis had devastated. - [Source](https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-qe1-3305530)\n\nIf you're still scratching your head on what QE is, here's the Wikipedia overview definition, as well as (hopefully) a more simplified definition.\n\n[Quantitative Easing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_easing) (QE) -  is a monetary policy whereby a central bank purchases at scale government bonds or other financial assets in order to inject money into the economy to expand economic activity.\n\n* This is what the Fed will do to extract collateral (including US Treasuries) from the economy in order to push in liquidity. The Fed started doing this in 2008 to extract toxic collateral from the market and encourage economic growth because it allowed more cash flow in the economy.\n* This pulls out collateral from the economy, and pushes cash (liquidity) in.\n* **It was a ticking timebomb ever since it started, because it extracts collateral from the market, slowly creating a collateral shortage issue.**\n\nCheck out the effects of QE on the Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI):\n\n[DJI Before And After Quantitative Easing Begins](https://preview.redd.it/cktjwttu8k671.png?width=1528&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e23f2e54e6204d8c56323d7e6bc8772c1a02535)\n\nIt was helping the economy reverse the death spiral, and it has been pumping the economy ever since the introduction of QE. The problem is, of course, that collateral would continue to be sucked out of the market through the mechanics of QE.\n\n**And QE can't continue forever**, because collateral is a fundamental part of the repo market which allows cash to flow in the economy. When you don't have collateral, you can't post the collateral in the market for cash from banks, and thus the flow of cash basically shuts down. You cannot perform a normal repo transaction between a Bank / Hedge Fund / Financial Institution.\n\nThe Fed tried to stop QE after a while. Instead of pulling collateral out of the economy, they needed to try to push collateral back into the economy. In order to stop QE, they tried what was, in essence, the \"reverse\" of QE called Quantitative Tightening (QT).\n\n[Quantitative Tightening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_tightening) (QT) -  (or quantitative hardening) is a contractionary monetary policy applied by a central bank to decrease the amount of liquidity within the economy. The policy is the **reverse of** **quantitative easing** **(QE)**, aimed to increase money supply in order to \"stimulate\" the economy.\n\n* This is what the Fed will do to extract liquidity from the economy in order to push in collateral. It is used to attempt to reverse the effects of QE, to try to regain balance in the economy.\n* This pulls out cash (liquidity) from the economy, and pushes collateral in.\n* **The Fed attempted QT in 2018, but it proved to have very bad consequences on the economy. So, they went back to QE in 2019, continuing to can-kick the effects of the 2008 crash.**\n\nThis is a chart showing the Fed's \"Total Assets\", where collateral is an asset for the Fed. So when collateral was extracted from the economy through QE, it went onto their \"Assets\" side of their balance sheet.  When collateral was pushed back into the economy through QT, it was extracted from their \"Assets\" side of their balance sheet.\n\n1. At the start of QE in 2008, there is a surge of assets due to the buying up of MBS's and treasuries.\n2. Around 2018 the assets began to decline because the Fed attempted QT by pushing collateral back into the economy and sucking liquidity out.\n3. Around September 2019 the assets began to increase again because the Fed went back to QE after realizing the negative effects it was having on the economy due to causing a liquidity shortage.\n\nSo... what happened in September of 2019? **Why did QT fail after a decade of QE**?\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.federalreserve.gov\\/monetarypolicy\\/bst\\_recenttrends.htm](https://preview.redd.it/x6pfomz2ck671.png?width=893&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c667c5cc3dbc94de50944208f107aac1dd72d73)\n\n# \n\n# 3. Quantitative Easing Cannot Be Reversed. The Can-Kick Continues Until The Economy Crashes\n\nDespite pumping in a bunch of liquidity into the market through QE, the economy was **still lacking liquidity**. When the Fed started to reverse QE through QT, the liquidity in the market tightened and thus the negative effects on the economy began to surface in September of 2019.\n\n[https:\\/\\/blog.pimco.com\\/en\\/2019\\/09\\/repo-rate-spike-a-tail-of-low-liquidity](https://preview.redd.it/9sd32gdxdk671.png?width=630&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ee9d749419bc2b6c0a84682f6f9b0b886ceca93)\n\n**Less than a year after starting QT**, a liquidity crisis emerged on September 15th, 2019, when the repo rate spiked up severely. This was a clash of events surrounding the lower liquidity issue.\n\n>Banks\u2019 \u201creporting\u201d dates are known inflection points in the short-term funding markets and typically fall at the end of the month, quarter, and of course the year. **But periodically, the 15th of the month is also a pressure point**. Such was the case this past Monday when a short-term funding rate that had been hovering around 2.21% soared as high as 10%.  \n>  \n>The funding market succumbed to a trifecta of pressures:\n\n1. Payments on corporate taxes were due on 15 September, leading to high redemptions of more than $35 billion in money market funds.\n2. Cash balances increased by an additional $83 billion in the U.S. Treasury general account, which reduces excess reserves and simultaneously acts to reduce the aggregate supply of overnight liquidity available in funding markets.\n3. Dealers needed an additional $20 billion in funding to finance the settlement of recent scheduled U.S. Treasury issuance.\n\n>...  \n>  \n>...  \n>  \n>On September 15, **as so many institutions needed funding**, **repo rates climbed well above the fed funds upper-end target at the time of 2.25% to briefly touch 5%.** **The following day, cash repo markets traded as high as 10% for those looking to finance agency mortgage positions overnight**. **Later that morning, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York acknowledged the pressures and conducted its first Open Market Operation (OMO) in more than a decade to add reserves to the funding markets that were clearly in need of the liquidity**. Subsequently, after its meeting Wednesday, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announced a cut in the interest on excess reserves (IOER) of 0.30% \u2013 five basis points more than its cut in the fed funds rate \u2013 providing some relief to the upper bound of money-market yields.\u00a0 - [Source](https://blog.pimco.com/en/2019/09/repo-rate-spike-a-tail-of-low-liquidity)\n\nDue to the reduced liquidity from QT, because it sucks out liquidity and pushes in collateral, the markets hit a critical point where there was too much cash that was needed and not enough to supply those who needed the cash. There was huge amounts of strain on the economy.\n\nThis was most likely due to continued large leverage + derivatives abuse stemming from what led to the 2000-2007 Housing Market Bubble. The Fed realized that QT could not continue because of the liquidity shortage that was arising. **They had to stop QT and continue QE in order to continue to pull out collateral and pump in liquidity. And thus, the collateral shortage time bomb continued ticking.**\n\nBelow is the figure of when the repo rate shot up to \\~10% within a day. This was awful, because it was much more expensive for loans to go out. The repo market would have shut down from nobody wanting to spend 10% on a repurchase agreement to get cash for the day. How would ANYONE get 10% return **overnight** to pay for these loans? The flow of cash was about to halt.\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.federalreserve.gov\\/econres\\/notes\\/feds-notes\\/what-happened-in-money-markets-in-september-2019-20200227.htm](https://preview.redd.it/86p3getwwj671.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a503c9055d655f80557da8bf46744c205f60011)\n\n# \n\n# 4.

Nobody expected it.\n\nAnd boy, **oh boy**, did COVID wreak havoc on the economy and the financial world. While the Fed was slowly approaching a collateral crisis through QE, COVID exacerbated the issue due to the sudden impact it had on liquidity. COVID increased liquidity, and when you have a sudden surge of liquidity, you need to balance it with collateral. The economic balance was tipping as of March of 2020.\n\nThis does not even take into account the effects of many people losing their jobs, being unable to pay rent/mortgages, and other issues that arose from COVID. Those all apply to another ticking time bomb: the CMBS issue, equivalent to the MBS bubble of 2000-2007, which I discussed in my other post.\n\nThe COVID pandemic caused a surge of money being printed from stimulus packages in the US. When you print a bunch of money into the economy on a whim, you risk driving inflation of the currency itself. What does inflation encourage? Less spending from companies, due to the higher price. This leads to less loaning of cash in the repo market, and banks obtaining an ever-surplus of cash.\n\nCOVID caused a sudden surge of trillions of dollars worth that the economy couldn't handle naturally. Compare the treasury balance versus the deposits over time, and the surge that occurred in 2020 in response to the pandemic. The COVID stimulus bills pumped in a **massive** amount of money into the economy at the risk of inflation. And we're already seeing the effects of inflation occur on the [supply chain](https://www.businessinsider.com/why-supply-shortages-economy-inventory-chips-lumber-cars-toilet-paper-2021-5):\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.federalreserve.gov\\/monetarypolicy\\/bst\\_recenttrends.htm](https://preview.redd.it/amwahlvykk671.png?width=877&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e343c265451a1b2d6754a4d04971bb445e58f43)\n\nStimulus checks were sent out to retail. Companies were bailed out. Unemployment increased, resulting in more unemployment benefits going out due to the relief bills. More money printed. More money deposited at banks.\n\nThere was a ton of cash (liquidity) being pumped into the economy over the past year from March 2020 to June 2021. Because of this, due to inflation and an excess of cash, banks began to get a surplus of cash deposited. People had more cash. They didn't need to spend money on rent/mortages. Companies didn't want to spend more due to fears of inflation. So, bank deposits went up.\n\n**The main problem with this is that the cash deposited with the banks became a liability on their balance sheets. When you have a surplus of liabilities on your balance sheet, you need to 'balance' it out with assets, such as US Treasuries.**\n\nThe banks were now in trouble because they had way, way too many deposits. They were at risk of defaulting due to their SLR requirements. Here is a figure showing how deposits (liabilities) of banks increased over time. It mushroomed during the COVID pandemic:\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.ft.com\\/content\\/a5e165f7-a524-4b5b-9939-de689b6a1687](https://preview.redd.it/6dm07sa3oj671.png?width=891&format=png&auto=webp&s=9acce6ceb03841c64828198eefff21eb06b1e310)\n\nTo combat this issue, the Fed decided to introduce a relief program for banks regarding SLR because of the massive increase of liquidity due to the uppercut that COVID created on the financial world.\n\n>The supplementary leverage ratio (**SLR**) is the US implementation of the Basel III Tier 1 leverage ratio, **with which banks calculate the amount of common equity capital they must hold relative to their total leverage exposure**. Large US banks must hold 3%. Top-tier bank holding companies must also hold an extra 2% buffer, for a total of 5%. The SLR, which does not distinguish between assets based on risk, is conceived as a backstop to risk-weighted capital requirements. - [Source](https://www.risk.net/definition/supplementary-leverage-ratio-slr)\n\nIn more of a simplified summary, SLR is a requirement of total equity that a bank must hold compared to their total leverage exposure. If they are exposed to leverage, they need to hold enough capital for that position otherwise they are at risk of defaulting. In this case, they only need to hold a measly 3%-5%, dependent on how large of a bank they are. Just like in 2008 - these banks can have massive leverage and SLR is to \"help protect the economy\" from them abusing leverage.\n\nBut hey, the Fed put in place some protections for the year to help these banks since they were obviously overleveraged to begin with. These protections expired on March 31st, 2021.\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.fool.com\\/investing\\/2021\\/03\\/29\\/the-fed-is-ending-one-of-its-pandemic-relief-progr\\/](https://preview.redd.it/14pa4yngtj671.png?width=1433&format=png&auto=webp&s=534726bcf83b0bf40ede7b196191d66c29094d6e)\n\n>**The Fed's relief program last year allowed banks to exclude U.S. Treasuries and central bank reserves from the SLR calculation**. The relief program was a response to the many non-banking institutions selling Treasuries to raise cash, and coincided with other measures, including the $2.2 trillion CARES Act, which resulted in even more Treasuries being sold into the market. - [Source](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/29/the-fed-is-ending-one-of-its-pandemic-relief-progr/)\n\n**Right after the expiration of the protection plans of SLR, the Reverse Repo market began to blow up because the banks had way too much liquidity and not enough treasuries on their balance sheets.**\n\nThe argument that the banks were \"parking their money at the Fed\" was a reasonable explanation at first. Though, with 0% ROI from the RRP at the time, the banks would literally get no return on their investments. So for that argument, all of their other investments would have had to yield negative in order for RRP to be more enticing. Does this make sense to you that they'd use 0% RRP to be an 'investment'?\n\nThe fact that the RRP began to ramp up and then explode after the SLR protections lifted makes this look like a collateral shortage issue. And of course, with QE occurring over the past decade, makes it more likely, because collateral was sucked out of the economy and onto the Fed's balance sheet over the years.\n\n**That was of course questionable on whether it was a liquidity or collateral issue, until, the RRP rate dropped negative in March of 2021, as well as in April of 2021.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 5. Reverse Repo Rate Flips Negative; Warnings Of Collateral Shortage\n\nThink about it quite simply in a supply/demand factor and the reverse repo when the RRP rate dropped negative.\n\nYou are a bank. You want to get Collateral from the Fed to balance your sheets. The Fed says they'll give you a small amount of interest for borrowing their collateral overnight. But now, imagine that the supply of collateral is too low and demand is too high. The Fed will no longer want to pay you for borrowing its collateral so it will shift the interest rate down. If demand really outweighs supply, then the Fed would then want cash from YOU in order for YOU to borrow the collateral.\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.reuters.com\\/article\\/us-usa-bonds-repo-explainer\\/explainer-u-s-repo-market-flirts-with-negative-rates-as-fed-seeks-to-absorb-excess-cash-idUSKBN2C32AI](https://preview.redd.it/eysh9mx9ok671.png?width=961&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d9d1695922b01651eae06c6bcc2753ad0f5b789)\n\nThis was just one of the warning signs that a collateral issue was arising. The RRP rates were already at 0%, so the only way for them to move was either up or down. An increase in treasury demand could shift it down, into the negatives, which it did.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 6. The Fed Is Fudging The Numbers And Hiding A Collateral Shortage\n\nThe drop in RRP interest rates to the negative **came after** the Fed increased the total borrowing amount of counterparties in the RRP from $30 Billion to $80 Billion.\n\n[https:\\/\\/finadium.com\\/fed-increases-rrp-limits-from-30-billion-to-80-billion-to-ensure-supply-at-near-0-rates\\/](https://preview.redd.it/by2ftlpopk671.png?width=1028&format=png&auto=webp&s=747f50e2fb63aabaedb6e9e947aa117f6c75f91b)\n\nWhy did they do this? Think of it again as a supply versus demand issue. For simple math, imagine the Fed has 50 members.\n\n* At a limit of $30 Billion per member, that is a total of $30B \\* 50 = $1.5 Trillion that can be borrowed.\n* At a limit of $80 Billion per member, that is a total of $80B \\* 50 = $4 Trillion that can be borrowed.\n\nWhat is this doing? Why did the Fed increase the limit?\n\n**It's artificially inflating the total \"supply\" of treasuries that can be borrowed by counterparties in the RRP. It is attempting to keep the interest rate positive because there is so much demand for collateral and not enough supply in the markets and on the Fed's balance sheet. The RRP was already at 0%, there was nowhere for it to go besides negative, which as you know implies a shortage of collateral and a red flag for the financial world.**\n\nNot only did they artificially inflate the total supply to combat the demand by increasing the total borrow amount, **the Fed decided to not affect the assets side of its balance sheet during these RRP transactions**. **This effectively leaves the supply of treasuries on the Fed's balance sheet the same.** This is another method to can-kick to avoid interest rates going negative and flashing a collateral issue.\n\n>When the Desk conducts RRP open market operations, it sells securities held in the System Open Market Account (SOMA) to eligible RRP counterparties, with an agreement to buy the assets back on the RRP\u2019s specified maturity date. **This leaves the SOMA portfolio the same size**, as securities sold temporarily under repurchase agreements continue to be shown as assets held by the SOMA in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, but the transaction shifts some of the liabilities on the Federal Reserve\u2019s balance sheet from deposits held by depository institutions (also known as bank reserves) to reverse repos while the trade is outstanding. - [Source](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/rrp_faq/rrp-faq-archive/rrp-faq-200715)\n\nWe can see this visually from the Fed's balance sheet that they're not affecting their assets during the RRP. They're allowing counterparties to borrow treasuries **WITHOUT** affecting the supply - desperately trying to get away from the rising demand for treasuries and avoid treasury yields from snapping down (and likewise the price of treasuries up):\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.federalreserve.gov\\/monetarypolicy\\/bst\\_recenttrends.htm](https://preview.redd.it/evxua80crk671.png?width=893&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a925b05e7a460b252457923ca97c730c511da6b)\n\n**On top of this, the Fed showed their hand ONCE AGAIN of fudging the numbers on June 16th when they bumped up the RRP rate to 0.05%. The short-term treasury yields briefly went BELOW the RRP interest amount of 0.05% on June 17th when the new RRP ROI was in effect.**\n\n**This is a BAD sign because now overnight RRP had a higher return than 2-month and 3-month treasury bonds.**\n\n**The Fed is fudging the numbers trying to hide the treasury bond shortage.**\n\nThe Fed cannot keep this up. They're trying to keep the T-bill yield curve propped up despite the treasury shortage. They're not affecting their balance sheet, and they also artificially increased the amount of treasuries in their \"supply\" by increasing the counterparty borrow limit from $30 Billion to $80 Billion.\n\n[https:\\/\\/alhambrapartners.com\\/2021\\/06\\/17\\/the-fomc-accidentally-exposes-itself-reverse-repo-style\\/](https://preview.redd.it/sp52qka5tj671.png?width=858&format=png&auto=webp&s=69d7ec8971035a7939f7bed116f7c923215019d6)\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.treasury.gov\\/resource-center\\/data-chart-center\\/interest-rates\\/Pages\\/TextView.aspx?data=yield](https://preview.redd.it/1f64o77tsk671.png?width=972&format=png&auto=webp&s=48e83c02895066c4e300c5a8adf3d3a065a6b016)\n\nThe Fed is also planning on increasing interest rates. This starts to scare the economy, which is most likely why we're now seeing the dump of the stock market over the past few days and the dump leading into the week of June 21st. This is **bad for the markets** because it means it's going to cost more for the economy to function (e.g. what happened in 2019 when Repo Rates spiked to 10%). Companies have to spend more to hire, produce, etc. **It costs the economy more to function.**\n\n**The Fed is pinned between a collateral issue from QE sucking out collateral, and a liquidity issue and COVID pumping in too much liquidity for the banks to handle.**\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.cnbc.com\\/2021\\/06\\/16\\/fed-holds-rates-steady-but-raises-inflation-expectations-sharply-and-makes-no-mention-of-taper.html](https://preview.redd.it/uhhhzguotk671.png?width=1202&format=png&auto=webp&s=cab32cef615311320c6cf27461fa7fb18b0fc7af)\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.bbc.com\\/news\\/business-57090421](https://preview.redd.it/p0v9ij2b0k671.png?width=1013&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf8f525bfc55e8f1287e921bbaaa408c5c27a253)\n\n# \n\n# 7. Quarter Ends Explode The Reverse Repo. The Next Quarter End Is June 30th, 2021.\n\nThis is not a date to look forward to for GME potentially rising. This is a date of \"Holy shit. **The RRP could explode to the point where treasury supply vs demand is unable to take it any more**\".\n\nAbout 3-4 days prior to quarter ends, the RRP explodes up in the amount of collateral that is borrowed from the Fed. This is because of the underlying plumbing of the financial markets, identified in Section 3 above, causes additional strain on the financial markets. The banks need more collateral to prop up their balance sheets for the night of the quarter-ends.\n\nThe RRP borrowed amount can shoot up almost **2-4x the current levels.** The amount of RRP at the moment is $747 Billion. **The RRP could explode 2-4x the amount it is at upon June 25th, 2021**. What if it's $1 Trillion by then due to the massive amount of collateral needed by the banks? More?\n\n**Can the Fed handle it?**\n\n**Can they still prop the yield curve up?**\n\n**Will the short-term treasuries dip below the RRP amount once more due to this shortage and flash red flags to the world of financial instability in the US?**\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.reddit.com\\/r\\/Superstonk\\/comments\\/nylihz\\/previous\\_rrp\\_behavior\\_on\\_quarter\\_ends\\_massive\\/](https://preview.redd.it/63daa1s8gk671.png?width=1277&format=png&auto=webp&s=d04d4a6b577152d26d6f7ea6e0c31f05f7ce80dc)\n\nIf the US Treasury yield curve snaps down from this instability and the Fed no longer able to prop up the yield curve, then it can drive treasury prices up.\n\nIf /u/atobitt's \"[Everything Short](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mgucv2/the_everything_short/)\" is true and they're actually shorting treasuries, then that can lead to banks defaulting due to the price of treasuries shooting up. When they default, they'll be forced to buy up all the treasuries that they've shorted into the market.\n\n**And it is very possible that they are shorting treasuries.**\n\nWhen performing RRP of 0%, the repo market was most likely shut down due to nobody needing cash loaned out. The banks only profitable move was to perform the RRP with the Fed and then **short** treasuries into the market, **rehypothecating** the treasuries to other parties. This would have also helped prop up the market by artificially increasing the supply of treasuries (collateral) in the market.\n\nIf it's true, and they have truly been performing the \"Everything Short\", then it could initiate a Global Financial Crisis equivalent to The Great Depression.\n\nDo I want that to happen? **No**. But is there a chance? **Yes, there is**.\n\nIs GME going to squeeze? Is the DD just false hopium? I don't think it's just hopium. I believe in the DD.\n\nBut some users might think otherwise and not believe in GME or the DD. Hello users outside of /r/superstonk! If you're reading this, check out the DD on the subreddit!\n\nEven if there's a **slight** chance of a GME squeeze in **your** eyes, and all of these signs are pointing to a market crash...\n\n[Why not give it a shot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nSHsbFe-o)?",

                "\"Wealth only trickles down when the wealthy are bleeding.\"",
                "This hits at one of the core flaws of libertarianism. They tend to hold as a core axiom that competitive markets and free markets are one in the same, i.e. that the \"natural state\" of the markets are highly competitive, and if there is a lack of competition, it must be an \"unnatural state\", i.e. there is some sort of top-down interference, government policies, which restrict competition.\n\nLibertarians thus see cronyism as happening from the top-down, where governments interfere with the markets, create monopolies, and all for the purpose of enriching themselves. Hence, they conclude the problem is government, that you have to get rid of government and then the problems will be solved.\n\nThis is the direct opposite view of Marxists. Marxists instead argue that markets inherently lead to a gradual increase in monopolization over time, what Marx referred to as the \"laws of the concentration and centralization of capitals\", and that market economies have a natural tendency to move more and more away from competition over time.\n\nMore than this, Marxists also see political power as not ultimately originating from the superstructure of society (the politics), but instead from the base of society (the economics). Any government policy requires enforcement, but any enforcement inherently presupposes an economic system which can produce tools of enforcement and allocate them appropriately to the enforcers. Politics is inherently derivative of economics.\n\nThe reason the political system favors the wealthy is not because of some laws implemented by some evil cabal that if they were just abolished, then capitalism would \"work\". No, the reason the political system favors the wealthy is because the wealthy are the ones who control society's wealth, and so of course the political system will favor them.\n\nNo law you write on a piece of paper will make a billionaire like Jeff Bezos have equal political influence as a minimum wage worker barely making ends meet. Production is the most fundamental basis of human society and those who control production control society's wealth and will inevitably have more influence. Even if you write laws saying bribery is illegal then they can just bribe those who enforce it.\n\nHence, Marxists do not see cronyism as a result of top-down processes implemented by a corrupt superstructure, by some evil cabal within the government that corrupted \"*true* capitalism\" and turned it into cronyism.\n\nRather, Marxists see cronyism as originating from a bottom-up process, that stems from the economic base in and of itself. Markets inevitably lead over time to greater and greater monopolization, creating a larger and larger gap between the working masses and the capitalists, and even if there is a \"rising tide\" and workers' wages rise as well, the profits of capital increase disproportionality faster, and capital continues to centralize rapidly, leading to an increasing social chasm between the rich and the poor.\n\nThis is why libertarianism/conservatism has never worked in history and will never work. They *can't* get rid of \"big government\" because the economic base, capitalism, inherently creates an enormous social divide, enormous polarization in the economy. This enormous wealth inequality naturally translates to power inequality, which then allows the capitalists to capture the state for their interests.\n\nOnce the capitalists capture the state, there is no reason for them *not* to implement \"big government\" but for their own benefit, i.e. corporate bailouts and subsidies and such. Libertarian policies, hence, in practice, ***always lead to \"big government\"***. Never in human history have they actually achieved their goals, because their goals are fundamentally impossible and self-contradictory.\n\nAnother separate point is that these people also have a tendency to water down what \"capitalism\" means. Capitalism is about ***capital***, that's why it's called ***capital***ism. This refers to a specific kind of society dominated by capital, i.e. production for profit. Libertarians like water down \"capitalism\" to refer specifically just to trade or markets, but capitalism is not tradeism or marketism. It's capitalism. Pre-capitalist economies have had trade and markets and so have socialist economies.\n\n--\n\ncredit to aimixin",

Sitting in our fancy cars, gridlocked on the freeway, every single day. To go to work for a job we don't like and get paid barely enough to get by.

This is again based on comparing mortality rates between decades and assuming the British were at fault - a terrible argument for the mechanism of what caused the deaths - https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X22002169#t0015\nWe can see a lot of deaths from floods and other Events - https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/number-of-deaths-from-natural-disasters?country=~IND\n\nNow of course, none of this means that the British weren't wrong to violate the rights of the people of India and other countries, or that they weren't responsible for some number of deaths at the time.

                "Anti-colonialists talk about the 'colonial project' as if the British one was the only one. Often described as domination, despotism, oppression, theft or unconstrained violence. But that description does not fare well in the light of history. No one in London said 'let's go and conquer the world'.\nThe plain truth is there was no essential motivation behind the British Empire. Fact is the extension of English, after 1707, was often a consequence of international rivalry and war, the need to gain competitive advantage.\n\nThe desire of self-defence (Russia, Spain etc) and therefore advantage in international competition or war was often the leading imperial motive of those who ruled Britain, whether from the throne or Parliament. More widespread, popular motives were the need to make ones way in the world, the intention to trade and the excitement of foreign adventure.\n\nProsperous trade requires peace. Go and research the increasing disruption in India from the Muslim Mughals and the Persians for context. Foreign mercenaries were hired by India for protection. So the logic of trade led, through the need for security, to the acquisition of military power. That led to control over territory, not through conquest.\n\nAs Tirthankar Roy stated :\n\"Turning the emergence of the empire...into a battle between good and evil creates melodrama: it invites the reader to take sides in a fake holy war. But if good soap opera, it is bad history. The empire was not an invasion. Many Indians, because they did not trust other Indians, wanted the British to secure power. They preferred British rule over indigenous alternatives and helped the Company form a state....The empire emerged mainly from alliance. It emerged from lands 'ceded' to the company by Indian friends, rather than lands it 'conquered'...The Company came to rule India because many Indians wanted it to rule India'.\n\nRoy, Economic History of India 1707-1857, pp. 4-5.",
