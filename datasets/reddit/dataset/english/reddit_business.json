My nephew was annoyed but agreed to come back the next day.   \n\n\nThe next day on his way to his interview there was something blocking the road that caused DOT to come out and clear it, this made my nephew 7 minutes late for this interview. When he arrived the manager told him that because he was late he wouldn't be allowed an interview and to \"be on time next time\".   \n\n\nI'm more than a little annoyed at this whole situation, my nephew was proactive in trying to get a job here, was early to his 1st interview and even came back a 2nd time after having his time wasted. He was 7 minutes late from things that were out of his control and now a fast food place won't interview him?   \n\n\nMake it make sense.   \n\n\n&#x200B;",

And embarrassing for my sister. \n\nThis happened a while ago and I\u2019m still getting shit for it, so I think I know your answer, but maybe some explanation will help?\n\nSo around 6 months ago, my fianc\u00e9 (we were together for around 7 years, but were friends before that.) left me, because she \u201crealized\u201d she never loved me and that I was \u201cholding her back\u201d. \n\nShe was not interested in therapy, and I am not in the habit of begging someone to stay, so I helped her pack and dropped her off at a hotel, which is what she wanted, and where she asked to be left. \n\nAbout a month ago she called me crying in the middle of the night to say that she had made a mistake and wanted to come \u201chome\u201d. \n\nI had promptly hung up on her, because I also firmly believe in the rule \u201cdon\u2019t let them tell you they don\u2019t want you more than once. \u201c\n\nApparently my family didn\u2019t get the memo because for a while after that my family (particularly the older women) had been pressuring me to hear her out and even going so far as to tell me her \u201cside\u201d of the story, and how she had a breakdown and it didn\u2019t have anything to do with me. Blah blah blah, don\u2019t buy it.\n\nMy sister recently called me out of the blue and started talking to me about how I don\u2019t wanna be the reason for \u201canything bad\u201d, so I should call and talk to my ex. I tried to brush it off, but she kept saying things like. \u201cWell, you don\u2019t want it to be your fault is all I\u2019m saying\u2026\u201d and shit like that. \n\nI didn\u2019t like what she was implying so I admit I snapped, and said something not so nice.  Something kinda like: \u201cMaybe you should worry about your own relationship, I mean, god knows it takes all of your mental fortitude to keep your pants on.\u201d\n \nWhich is bad because her first two marriages ended due to cheating on her end. After a moment, She started crying on the phone and kept saying \u201cI can\u2019t believe you would say that\u201d and \u201cThat\u2019s so cruel, you don\u2019t know what I went through!\u201d \n\nI replied something like, \u201cAnd that\u2019s why I usually stay out of it, you know? Try to mind my business?\u201d\n\nApparently that \u201cisn\u2019t even close\u201d to the same thing, and since then I\u2019ve been getting yelled at by all the women in the family, but at least the ex talk has quit.\n\nAITA?",

                "DeSantis is not only costing Florida tourist dollars, but also costing Floridians in many other ways.\n\nAs a corporate and industry friendly politician, insurance premiums have soared 206% since he became governor and, on average, Florida homeowners pay over $4,200 per year for home insurance (triple the national average of $1,700 according to data from the Insurance Information Institute).\n\n[https://www.newsweek.com/florida-insurance-premiums-rose-206-percent-desantis-governor-1812740](https://www.newsweek.com/florida-insurance-premiums-rose-206-percent-desantis-governor-1812740)\n\nNot to mention he is costing Florida taxpayers millions of dollars with his \"anti-woke\" agenda (i.e. flying migrants out of Florida, lawsuits, etc).\n\n[https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/03/ron-desantis-insurance-industry-donors-florida-governor](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/03/ron-desantis-insurance-industry-donors-florida-governor)\n\n[https://reason.com/2023/02/06/ron-desantis-wants-12-million-to-transport-migrants-from-any-point-in-the-u-s/](https://reason.com/2023/02/06/ron-desantis-wants-12-million-to-transport-migrants-from-any-point-in-the-u-s/)\n\nAnd for what exactly?\n\nFor a politician on the national stage and trying to create a national profile while running for president, there is very little discussion about his actual governance.\n\nThe statistics of Florida's social and economic well-being reveals that Florida falls short in almost any measure that matters to the lives of its citizens and that Florida is toward the bottom of state rankings which assess the quality of education, health care, and many other areas which are key to a successful society.\n\n[https://time.com/6266618/ron-desantis-florida-governance-essay/](https://time.com/6266618/ron-desantis-florida-governance-essay/)\n\nSome points taken from the above link...\n\n* An investigation by the Orlando Sentinel revealed the startling fact that 99% of Florida\u2019s companies paid no corporate income tax, abetted by tax-avoidance schemes and state officials who gave a low priority to enforcing tax laws.\n* A study by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy found that Florida had the third least-equitable tax system of the 50 states. In the state\u2019s \u201cupside-down\u201d tax structure, the poorest 20% of Florida families paid 12.7% of their income in taxes, while the families whose income was in the top 4% paid 4.5%, and the top 1% paid 2.3%, according to the study.\n* The Commonwealth Fund, a private foundation that studies health-care systems globally, found in its 2022 \u201cscorecard\u201d that Florida had the 16th worst health care among the 50 states. It\u2019s no wonder that Florida ranks below the northern blue states in life expectancy and rates of cancer death, diabetes, fatal overdoses, teen birth rates, and infant mortality.\n* Because of DeSantis\u2019s obstinacy, Florida is one of 10 states that have refused to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, an act of political spite that has cost those states billions in federal health care dollars and cost thousands of people their lives. More than 12% of Floridians are without medical insurance, a worse record than all but four other states.\n* Despite having the country\u2019s highest percentage of retirees, Florida has the worst long-term care among the 50 states, according to the American Association of Retired Persons.\n* Public schools fare no better than health care in DeSantis\u2019s Florida. Not only did Florida rank 49th in the country for average teacher pay in 2020, but the Education Law Center, a non-profit advocacy group based in New Jersey, found in a 2021 report that the state had the seventh-lowest per-pupil funding in the country. Education Week, which ranks states public school annually, looking beyond mere test scores, placed Florida 23rd in its 2021 report.\n\nEdit: Typo",

I had just put my hands in my pockets, so if this was a pickpocket attempt, it was immediately aborted.\n\nI always wondered what would have happened, though, because I always wear my wallet on a chain attached to my belt when I travel. It seems like this could have been quite embarrassing.",
                "Good luck with that, it takes me about 2 minutes to get my wallet out of my pocket myself, let alone someone else.\n\nYes, this happens.  I'm from London, I've literally locked eyes with several people who were in the process of pickpocketing people near me and/or people I was travelling with, and I've also thwarted attempts to \"herd\" a victim where one of them bumps or crushes onto a train with the victim, while another takes things from their bag or pocket.\n\nLiterally two or more people who were together earlier.  Then they separate to different parts of the train platform without communicating for no reason at all.  Then they start honing into their victim at the same time.  Then them seeing that I'm actually watching them, and with some rapid shared furtive glances abandoning their attempt and leaving the platform without a word said.  That's \\*not\\* natural behaviour.\n\nOne such potential-victim was my girlfriend with an unzipped bag with the open part exposed behind her arm (I don't know how many times I'd told her!).  She saw, suspected and noticed NOTHING throughout.  And I had done her bag zip up for her when I was sure that the pickpockets weren't a threat any more, and she didn't even feel it.\n\nIf you're travelling in a city... don't flash valuables (especially phones).  If you take calls, keep a tight grip on that phone and stay aware (best way is NOT to keep walking and talking... stop walking, tuck yourself into a corner where people can only approach you from one direction, and keep an eye out).  Be aware of everyone around you.  Not paranoid, just aware.  Make sure that anything of value isn't worth the effort... they can just snatch and run even the most \"closed\" of bags, but you just have to make it not worth their risk.  Keep an eye out, a tight hand on it, and show that it's not just being ignored.\n\nAnd keep your wallet/phone/whatever in a tight and inaccessible pocket.  Jean pockets, under a jacket.  Or the inner jacket pocket, buttoned up and DO NOT unzip your jacket.  I've asked people to step the fuck away from me when I'm withdrawing cash from an ATM.  Classic crowding technique to grab your money and run.  I stop, turn round, say \"Not being funny, mate, but this is London.  Could you step back...  you're making me nervous.\"  Most often just people not thinking (and they're always co-operative and apologise) or not used to leaving a gap, but a couple of times I think it was actually catching them in the act (just because of the area I was in at the time).\n\nAnd pat your pockets regularly.  Every time you stand up.  Every time you are going into a crowd.  Every time you have been through a crowd.  Make it so that it \"feels\" empty not to have your wallet on you because it's always there and you know where it is.  Some people will say patting your pocket lets people know where it is?  They know anyway.  And they will try three empty pockets without their owners knowing before they hit the one that works.  But if you pat all your pockets (keys, wallet, phone, tissues, yep, got everything), they have no idea which, and they know you're checking and aware.\n\nLived in London all my life.  Literally everyone I've ever asked has been mugged, their phone stolen, robbed, card cloned, bag mysteriously \"go missing\" - even in hospital waiting rooms (classic as people put their bags under their seat while they wait), theatres, broad-daylight, etc. etc. etc.  I haven't ever had that, not even once.  And I'm a weedy-looking fuck who would look easy to intimidate or overpower.  If a fight or scuffle started, they'd win.  But they hate starting any scuffle with someone who knows or suspects what's coming.\n\nAwareness is key.  I can't walk out my front door without my wallet without knowing something's wrong before I even close it behind me.  It's a great way to never got locked out!\n\nAnd I lose track of the number of times I've moved my partner to walk on the other side of me when I see people we need to pass in a subway or tight space, and they later ask \"Why did you do that?\" and they've totally failed to spot all kinds of things that I've seen the people up ahead doing (and then put myself between them and her open bag, or her phone that she was talking on, etc.).",

I\u2019m Trevor Ford ([proof](https://imgur.com/a/drOoV4v)), founding team member at [Yotta](https://www.withyotta.com/), a company that pays out cash prizes on savings via a lottery-like system (based on a concept called prize-linked savings).\r  \n\r  \nI used to be a regular lottery player, buying tickets weekly, sometimes daily.

I have had very long conversations with ChatGPT about code blocks that only deepen my understanding. You can't get that kind of engagement at that speed on StackOverflow or really any other online forum. I basically have a personal tutor that never gives up on helping me learn.",

                "I recently used ChatGPT 3.5 to write a launcher menu framework completely in bash.  If I were a noob to bash, I think this project would have gone off the rails as GPT made plenty of mistakes. For example, it would create functions and describe how useful the function was but never call it.  It would also prescribe methods that I knew would not work, and when I told it as such it would agree and then give me a method that does work\n\nWhere I think GPT really shines is for programmers that fully understand the syntax of the language they are coding in and are looking for the methodology/scaffolding for how to solve a problem and then adapting that method such that it actually works as intended.  \n\nIf SO can create a LLM that is specific to coding and values precision of the answer over making stuff up, I think they can recover quite a bit of that lost market share.",

For instance, when Microsoft decided to change Omnisharp to C# and mess up the extension, requiring me to install the \"C# Dev Kit\" and now I have a forced solution file in my projects that I don't need. Oh and it also breaks Ctrl+Click references to other projects because it then shows the DLL metadata instead of the source file containing the type I'm inspecting. I found the solution to the first one in their GitHub I think.\n\nAnother case where it helped was an issue with Gradle and Android Studio on the latest versions, so yeah.",
                "Scenario 1\nMy question is quite basic, and I get a quick correct answer 100% of the time from ChatGPT. I could have found the answer on stackoverflow/googling, but it would have taken longer and not have been as exact in the wording regarding my problem.\n\nScenario 2\nMy question is about obscure behaviors in third party libraries. With stackoverflow/Google I can't find the answer and have to resort to ask the question myself, and it will take long as hell to get an answer, the turnaround is long for communication and it probably is no explicit answer coming my way anyhow.\nWith ChatGPT, I can get instant feedback, and even though you sometimes get some hallucinations with those questions, they often take you closer to the answer, or you will get the answer after an hour or two of troubleshooting together with ChatGPT.\n\nAll in all, I prefer the new way even if it is not perfect always. If I have to resort to googling, it's probably doomed to fail anyhow.",

I used GPT-4 to do my entire uni assignment, which would've taken me 2 weeks in just a few hours and got a 97% lol. And if it can't do something, it will still always steer me well into the right direction. Truly revolutionary for coding. Would love to see what Stack Overflow can do in terms of releasing an LLM to be completely focused on programming.",

Sometimes they'd say it was duplicate but the answer linked wasn't to my question. It seemed like to ask a question that was good enough for them I'd have to already know enough to solve it without help.\n\n11 years into my career, I try to answer questions, but my answers are always deleted. Sometimes I see a wrong answer but my attempts to correct it are deleted.  \n\n\nIt seems like a big circle jerk where the only way to get points so you can be involved is to already have points and be involved.",

The users with high participation act hostile and supress you if you arent Master Level. It's a culture problem over there and it discourages people who are trying to learn and join the community or people who are trying to help while they learn. They are not gaining new users because ChatGPT doesnt judge them for asking what might be defined as a \"simple\" question. And if you search Stack Overflow too much in a day they block you.",

I mean fuck knows how bad I search for a solution, but GPT not only gave me a solution, it created a fucking bash script for me. Then to make matters BETTER, it actually added a progress bar to the whole thing. Symphony. \n\nNow mind you, GPT\u2019s knowledge cut off since 2021 does not help, SO is still very \u201crequired\u201d for troubleshooting miscellaneous things.",

                "I like it to do skeletons of functions and stored procedures. It explains why certain things are done a certain way, for example in [asp.net](https://asp.net) it'll explain why using statements are necessary for disposables, and it's decent at streamlining code. It's also great when you can't figure out a syntax issue in an unfamiliar part of a framework.\n\nYou can paste a function and ask it to optimize it, it will even explain why it made certain changes. \n\nI don't like that it falls on its face on dumb stuff. I asked it to read all of the .log files in a folder (IIS format), find the lines that met a particular pattern and capture a few parameters. It wrote a damn clean function to do this, but it fumbled the array indexes for picking the columns within each row. Still, I spent less time troubleshooting that, than what it would take me to write it from scratch.\n\nIn t-sql it is fantastic, I like it for complex jobs that require convoluted loops/cursors/etc. \n\nCan it replace SO 100%? Nope. In 24+ years of experience I have learned that since my work is mainstream, the odds that I am going to be the first one to run into a bug are almost zero. No matter how weird the bug, I can count that plenty of people ran into it, and at least a couple submitted fixes to SO. Maybe they can find a happy equilibrium where SO allows ChatGPT full access to their content in some kind of revenue share arrangement. If they are really smart they'll set it up so it trickles down to the user that authored that bit of content, sort of an AI royalty.",

            "selftext": "For a long time we have heard about how Indians prefer a salaried job and don't like becoming entrepreneurs. Even our parents and society discourage us from starting our business and recommend getting a stable job. \n\nI used to think the reason behind it was just fear and ignorance but a recent incident with my cousin has opened my eyes. \n\nMy cousin(M32) who was working in an multinational corporation as an engineer recently quit his job and came back to India to start a metal works factory. The whole thing was troublesome from the start. there were thousand approvals to be gotten and they needed to be gotten from different places. The problem was no one department would approve all the things they had to but would keep sending us to other department to get some other thing approved before they would approve one thing. \n\nWorst part was each one of those bureaucrats would take a long time to see the file and we had to pay the clerk a lot of money each time. Last straw was when the officials wanted an NOC from a temple before approving construction. We had all documents related to land and it was rezoned legally into a commercial property a decade ago. But the land was 800 meters away from a temple and still the temple authority had to give NOC saying they don't have any rights on the land. When we approached the official he said it we need to get a letter form revenue department. The official at revenue department said it would take 3 months and asked us for 1 crore if we wanted it quick. Cousin had already spent an enormous sum on land and rest was barely enough to build the factory and he was planning to get business loan. \n\nWe tried to get a letter signed by the temple priest but that was not sufficient and we had to get one from endowments department. The person at that department wants 20 lakhs again. \n\nEveryone kept saying \"you are starting factory and are rich. can't you even pay this much? if you don't have money why are you doing business?'. \n\nWorst part was how everyone just accepted this as the default. apart from the ED and RD, We had paid lot more money in bribe already. My cousin gave up on this venture and decided to just keep the land as it as an investment. He wrote off the bribes as loss and is going back abroad to start the factory in another country. \n\nGovernment keeps barking about make in India but this is the reality. This is why we will remain in service industry. \n\nEdit- This is in Andhra. We did not complain to anti corruption bureau as some of the officials are well known for their connections to ruling party. My cousin has already made preparations to start the factory (smaller than the original plan) in Vietnam. He has left for Vietnam for the same.\n\nEdit 2 - Many have commented about how I was just whining and how it is just a glass ceiling. Some have even said i copy pasted a movie plot(I had to go and the movie shivaji after reading multiple comments). \n\nIt wasn't just the approvals and NOC. The long times taken and the way there was no proper information regarding the process took its toll on my cousin. We could have paid someone to get this all done and we were approached by many about the same. They all had similar requirements. We had to pay a lot of money in cash. Now, I'm not even sure which bank would let you withdraw lakhs of rupees in cash but the whole thing wore out my cousin. He had his friend investing in the venture and his friend too backed out after all these things and left my cousin unable to proceed further. They have both decided to go to Vietnam.",

            "selftext": "Hi all. so I work at a private dog grooming shop going on 8 years now. During this time my relationship with my boss has become increasingly unhealthy. It started getting really bad during covid because she was struggling financially and we now only have 2 full time groomers. She started calling me up after work drunk and crying about every financial hardship she's going through, how she's afraid to lose the business, lose her house, and how if I were to decide to quit she would lose everything. \n\nShe would make these calls to me on a weekly basis, each time telling me the same thing, and saying things like \"I make more money than her,\" and shit talking my coworkers for requesting to take some vacation days. \n\nNow the mistake I made during a lot of this, is constantly reassuring her that I have no plans to leave and trying to comfort her because i just wanted the phone call to end. \n\nThe truth is, I've been miserable working there for a really long time. I care about my boss, but she is not a good business owner, has been rude to my clients, and I have come to be extremely resentful because I feel I've been guilt tripped into thinking that the fate of the business rests on my shoulders and im not \"allowed\" to leave. She even called me up crying that I was going back to school and would only be able to work 4 days a week, and said if I did that, she'd have to get a second job.\n\nShe has always taken it very personally when someone decides to move on, seeing it as a betrayal. But nearly everyone that has left, has left because of her. Now I'm just the sucker that stayed behind to help her out.\n\nI have a job interview at a really amazing salon in a week. If all goes well, I will give my boss 3 weeks notice, more if possible because I understand finding a replacement for me may be difficult. But I am TERRIFIED. Even though I know I need to do what's best for myself, I'm scared of her reaction and have thought, what if she's right and when I leave she won't be able to find a replacement and will lose it all? I can't believe the amount of anxiety and guilt I feel when I haven't even done the interview yet. Any advice or similar experiences would be greatly appreciated. \n\nTLDR; been at job for 8 years, toxic boss claims she wouldn't be able to find replacement for me, therefore would lose the business if I quit, I have a job interview in a week and am terrified of quitting due to guilt\n\nEdit: Thank you to everyone who commented, you don't know how much it's helped me think things through. It's clear to me that I am taking on her problems as if they are my own and I need to completely detach. I will be doing what's best for me and leaving asap. Appreciate y'all\u270c\u2764\n\nEdit: I've seen a lot of comments saying I should ask for more pay. While you're probably right, I am actually compensated well for the work that I do and make pretty decent money which is a huge reason I have stayed as long as I have. It is almost solely the emotional stress and toxicity that is driving me elsewhere",

                "You have to do what\u2019s best for you. Staying in a high stress job is going to be harder and harder mentally over time. Your boss needs to spend more time  on finding staffing solutions and ways to make profit than guilt tripping employees. I\u2019m a business owner and could only imagine how uncomfortable you feel.",
                "Just prep yourself for three weeks of guilt trips and remember that you actually hold the power.  She is responsible for her own business, the fact that it is failing is not on you.  If she is too shitty to you about it, just leave.  Once you have the new job you don't owe her anything else.  It sucks, but just keep in mind that it's for the best for yourself.\n\nI've always had the mindset of being a mercenary.  Is it healthy?  No, not really, but it keeps me from giving too much to a business anymore.  They won't hesitate a day, a second, to replace me if they needed to, why should I hesitate to better my circumstance?  Capitalism sucks, but since it's the system we're stuck with you have to advocate for yourself.  She's kept you in place for almost ten years and she didn't bother to better her practices.  That says all that it really needs to.  Do what's best for you and if she gets too shitty about it after you've secured a new job just quit.  Turn your stuff in, block her number, and enjoy a bit  of extra time before your new job.  But seriously, look into what's best for you.",
                "Maybe the best thing that could happen to her is losing the business. It doesn\u2019t sound like she really understands how to run it, and the constant stress she\u2019s putting herself, and her employees, under can\u2019t be good for her health. Maybe she\u2019s one of those people who just does better by working and collecting a paycheck. Regardless, you aren\u2019t a co-owner of her business. You don\u2019t share in the profits. Therefore, keeping it operational is not your responsibility. I would leave as soon as humanly possible if I were you. Also, don\u2019t let her guilt you into staying longer. It won\u2019t do any good. She won\u2019t use that extra time constructively. Instead, she\u2019ll spend it trying to find ways to pressure you into staying even longer.",

Right up until the company was struggling a little too much and then he cut my hours in half. He was shocked when I told him I\u2019d found another job (and doubled my salary). He considered it a betrayal and hasn\u2019t spoke to me since. It was awful at the time, but it was the best thing I ever did for my career. \n\nYou don\u2019t owe this woman anything. Run. Get that better job and build your career without her. If she can\u2019t run the company without you then you should be compensated like someone she can\u2019t afford to lose so that you won\u2019t want to consider other opportunities. It doesn\u2019t sound like that\u2019s the case.",

She has to figure things out and become a better boss and learn how to treat her workers, not you. SHE is the one causing issues, not you. You leaving isn't causing a problem, she is. It is all on her, entirely. None of it is on you. NONE.   \n\n\nYou get yourself that better job and get away from all that toxicity. Do not let her try to wheedle you into staying - honestly, I wouldn't even quit in person if I was you, I'd send her an email, letter, whatever, no notice because she's going to make whatever time you spend there after absolutely MISERABLE and do anything she can to force you to stay, and then block any contact from her so she can't spam you with voicemails of her crying and blaming you when things go belly-up because she has no idea how to manage a business.  \n\n\nWhen a business like that fails, it is entirely on the owner, never, ever, ever on the workers. You did your best, you gave far more than you owed her, and now it's going to be up to her to make her business work, as it should have been from the very start.  \n\n\nGood luck with your future endeavors!",

You HAVE to approach your employment the same way, no matter where you work. Do what you have to do; she will be fine. And if she\u2019s not, it\u2019s due ONLY to her bad decisions.\n\nEdit: DO NOT give 3 weeks notice. Absolutely not. Don\u2019t even give 2. This is a toxic environment and she WILL make your life hell during those weeks. Let her know on Monday that it will be your last week.

Also she's crying about having to get a second job, bruh do you know how many people work three or four jobs ? At the end of the day she is the one who started a small business and then for some reason decided to ride or die with it this is capitalism baby you don't owe her shit.",

Employees there don\u2019t make a ton and can therefore be easily lured away not only by competitors but by any employer in general. A large part of her value add as an owner of this sort of business is client retention and employee retention. If she is failing to do both for whatever reason, she shouldn\u2019t expect her business to remain viable.\n\nUltimately, you owe her nothing. You\u2019re not her partner and you have no stake in her business. She doesn\u2019t share profits with you, she wouldn\u2019t pay your salary if her business went under, and she\u2019d likely fire you if it was better for her bottom line.

Most of the world did: hundreds of companies closed their Russian operations and abandoned their assets in Russia. But one group of Western businesses, run from one EU country, headed in the other direction. Around the world, tankers owned by Greek shipping companies turned towards Russian ports.    \nAs other shipping lines refused to take Russian exports, the fees for carrying Russian oil rose, and Greek shipping companies capitalised on the opportunity. As their profits have grown, Greece has lobbied successfully to dilute sanctions on Russian oil. A merchant navy, run by a small group of Western oligarchs, keeps money flowing into Putin\u2019s regime.    \nRobin Brooks is the chief economist at the Institute for International Finance, the trade association for the global financial services industry. His research has shown the true scale of Greece\u2019s involvement in the Russian economy.   \nThe uncomfortable fact, Brooks tells me, is that \u201cRussia depends on Western transport infrastructure to keep its war going\u201d.",

                "This article is well written, but it's a lie and geared specifically for misinformation.  **If you really care**, then you can find the following clearly on either the US Treasury, EU, or UK government websites, and it all boils down to this:\n\n\\- as long as the price caps are met ($100 per bbl, $60 per bbl, $45 per bbl for refined, crude and low end product respectively)\n\n\\- as long as the products are sold to non-sanctioning countries (ie non US/EU/G7/Australia and New Zeland)\n\nthen it is explicitly stated by the US/EU/G7 sanctions (and I stress - **explicitly**) to be completely legal to transport the oil and/or refined products, finance its purchase, trade it, and provide services including it's transportation.  Indeed, the USA (Yellin) goes so far as to allow the import of oil at discounted prices and the reexport of refined product at market prices (\"artificially\" increasing the cracking spread, otherwise known as daisy chaining back in the day).\n\nYes, we all think it's stupid and is a meaningless sanction.  India, China, Turkey and some of the \"stans\" (which have long-term supply contracts are are land-locked), have absorbed almost all Russian product quite happily, either through direct pipelines or increased ship transportation to newly built or expanded refineries.  Russia is producing at full capacity.\n\nYes, without allowing Russian oil to flow to non-sanctioning countries (the sanctioning countries are absorbing all the other near-sources of oil) energy costs would skyrocket.  Brent, the nearest source supply for the EU, hasn't broken $86 per barrel all year.  By the way, the US is exporting all its crude and at the pump prices have increased 16% since the start of the year;  if Russian crude were not being sold and moved, US consumers would pay $5 per gallon, easily.\n\nNo, the transportation of Russian product to non-sanctioning countries is not illegal, and there is no cabal of Greek shipowners manipulating EU regulations, no matter how much you want to blame them.\n\nHOWEVER, if you really want to point the finger at someone, MAERSK, the Danish giant, was fined (a trifling fine at that) for transshipping Russian crude at Gibraltar, a clear and wilful violation of the sanctions.",

Now we're over 4 years later and we still never got that match and they even teased the match when Ronda returned but WWE killed Becky by turning her heel & had Ronda choose to face Charlotte for no freaking logical reason. Why would Ronda choose to fight the person that didn't take the title off her in the main event & not want to fight the person that embarrassed her & talked so much shit? They basically killed Becky vs Ronda to put over Bianca. Then they killed any chance of the match happening when Liv Morgan keeps pinning Ronda & giving Ronda a shitty reign where she just loses the title to Charlotte randomly on SD and then becomes a tag team wrestlers. WWE killed both Becky and Ronda the last 2 years so bad that a match with them is lucky to main event a RAW which is insane when you think about it. Becky/Ronda get demoted to the Midgard meanwhile Charlotte is still in the same position she's always been in, WWE got what they wanted. CharlotteWinsLOL",

I would be concerned by that.  \n\nStill, I think it's far too soon to know if Florida is going to see much negative impact, if any at all.

Now the tables are turned: he has so prioritized \"anti-wokism\" (really his political campaign) that he has failed to rule in the best interest of the people of Florida. As this article shows, they will feel the consequences many years down the line.\n\nI'm also thinking back to [Disney's statement](https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/statement-from-the-walt-disney-company-on-signing-of-florida-legislation/) that started their tussle with DeSantis.

Same with basically everything else. When money runs just about everything, in my opinion, there's nothing scarier or more stressful than hitting a stand still. The more you make you should only be motivated to make more, more, and more. I've never heard of someone making \"enough\" money. That word doesn't exist with most of us. Nobody ever has \"enough\".

If you can't motivate yourself to create a bright future for you, meet someone who can and I promise you your perspective on most things will change. Change is really inevitable and our survival in our current world relies on it. Fighting it will do much more harm than good. Everything has a balance.

The rule of thumb (amongst multiple other rules) is that a costumer can\u2019t reduce this amount with more than 10% since it might make it difficult adjusting to a major change in your spending capability. \n\n- I would imagine it\u2019s somewhat the same for actors in the sense, that throughout their career they both increase their fortune but also their expenses. Some might even become dependent on a high paycheck to maintain their upkeep of insurances, vehicles, kid\u2019s probably expensive private school/Uni/tutor etc./ their home(s) and so on. \n\nA funny way to look at it is if you try you would probably not be able to say the exact expenses you have in a month. For someone who earns way more this amount becomes a lot more, they may even hire people to take care of it, an abrupt retirement could be something near impossible. What you would need to do is earn enough money to invest and thereby create a passive income which could pay off your expenses and leave you somewhere close to 80-90% of your usual budget (as a formal retirement).

Also, if you notice, the QR code is a sticker.

I would not book a business class ticket off the bat due to the usual obscenely high price compared to economy.  I would much rather spend the extra money on my trip.

We recently did ATL-CDG which is about 9 hours, leaving about midnight. I was able to get four hours or so of sleep and that made my first day in Paris very tolerable. The meal was good...but it's not why I booked into business. Even returning during the day, a lot of people laid down and slept, but it was nice to just be able to stretch and relax for nine hours.

Lie-flat seats are really awesome, but I didn't sleep any better or feel more rested when I landed - you're still on an airplane for 10+ hours. The 1st class food/service can be hit or miss, but if you're not eating I'm not sure it would be worth it. Look for a premium economy seat in an emergency exit row. Most widebodies have entire rows dedicated to the mid-plane exits, so you will have enough room to stretch your legs out entirely and you can get out of our seat without crawling over anyone. One caveat is that you can't put stuff under the seat in front of you, but its a ten hour flight, you will be thankful to stand up and get stuff from the overhead bin. Good luck, enjoy your trip!",

I think I would have actually killed someone if I had spent 17+ hours stuck in the same economy seat. The extra legroom alone is worth it; not being tired and pissed off when you get to your destination is pretty nice.",

I mostly fly business and rarely have to pay out of pocket for it.\n\nOnce you get into the details you can get an idea of when a business class seat is worth the upgrade.  Air france is generally a good value for cash upgrades even though it is not my favorite Business class product.  I do this upgrade all the time for JFK to Paris so 10hrs for $800 is a great deal.",
                "The food is a very small part of the overall Business Class experience.\n\nYou get a lot of small little luxuries that are definitely \u2018extra\u2019 but makes for a much nicer experience than the usual one in economy. It starts with priority check-in and luggage drop off. Then you get whisked through in priority security lines. While waiting you\u2019ll have access to a lounge which is less chaotic and when able, can kept you fed. Sometimes you can even take a shower which is honestly one of the most amazing things you can do before a flight. Then you get early boarding and don\u2019t have to wait in a massive, disorganized queue like everyone else. On-board even if service is mediocre you\u2019ll still likely be well-taken care of due to the nature of the smaller cabin. Food comes fast and your drinks can be topped off regularly for most of the flight if you wish. Then of course there is the seat. With the right plane and airline you can get a private pod with no neighbour and lie-flat sleeping. Even if you don\u2019t care to sleep, that recline is guilt-free and extraordinarily comfy compared to economy.

You might get lounge access for an hour or two before the flight if the airport you're flying out of is large where they serve mediocre food and drinks. Totally not worth it. \n\nMost likely you're in the air for under 8-10 hours. Ask yourself if paying $6000 instead of $1500 is worth it for those 8 hours? If you flew Economy (which on international flights comes with food and alcohol service, baggage allowance and a screen with entertainment anyways) you would have an extra $4500 to spend on your hotel room, food and entertainment at your destination. \n\nI'd rather save the money and stay at a 5 star hotel for multiple days, and dine at Michelin Star restaurants at the destination rather than spend that money on a business class ticket for a few hours travel time. \n\nI say this as an experienced traveler that has traveled across continents multiple times a year for a decade for business and pleasure. \n\nThe only exception to this, is if your employer is paying for your flight.

Watch a couple movies eat the snacks and before you know it your flight is over.

That is more of a first class thing. Even if it is available, you really don't need it.",
                "People really do be paying 800$ to be able to wait in a small room instead of the airport seats, enter the plane earlier and have some extra leg room.\n\nTell me you make too much money without telling me.",
                "It's crazy to me that they justify charging THOUSANDS of dollars more per ticket because they serve \"better\" food.\n\nIdk about you all, but I can not eat for half a day :)\n\nI've flown business a couple times on long hauls due to work, and the food is always pretty gross compared to any food not served in the air \n\nFirst/business class food, on the ground, would not be \"high-end\" ,  let alone cost thousands of dollars \n\nLie-flat seats, sure. Easy/better checkin, okay. Slightly better airplane food, gtfo",
                "For a lie flat seat yes. I have trouble sleeping in everyday life so I have a lot of trouble sleeping on planes. We did business class to and from France in the spring and I was able to sleep on the way over. On the way home the seat was pretty comfortable but my back was jacked up for a while when we got back and my chiropractor was on vacation.",
                "If you can afford it, take it. Was hell going on a 15 hour flight as a bigger guy in coach. If I could I\u2019d fly business.",
                "I have never paid for business class, but got lucky to be upgraded for free twice. \n\nOnce it was a cross antlantic flight and the food was definitely not on my radar - surely it was great and if you pay for your upgrade in advance I'm sure you can pre order your meal ro suit your needs. \n\nFor me, the comfort of the seat and ability to sleep stretched out were the luxuries I would definitely pay for if I could afford it.\n\nI got off the plane rested and refreshed, ready to enjoy the day.",
                "Not for me. I\u2019d rather use that to upgrade to suites",
                "i mean, you still have to exist in a seat.",
                "For me, it's entirely about the seat, the food is just a small perk. I'd definitely do it for a flight that long.",
                "Flying business ( for overseas flight) has completely changed how I travel. I don\u2019t lose a day \u201c recovering.\u201d That makes it worth it to me. Between that at having pre check, clear and global entry traveling is almost stress free.",
                "I fly first class basically every time and I hardly ever eat on the plane. For me it's all about the extra space and, more importantly, my wife and I not having to sit next to strangers.\n\nFor whatever reason eating on the plane often upsets my stomach. Last month I made a rare exception and had the meal, and regretted it greatly when I was driving a couple hours later. \n\nI'm literally sitting in Denver International right now waiting for my flight to O'Hare and after that last experience there's no way I'm having the meal today.",
                "Totally worth it if you have the money for it. The food is a non factor for me.",
                "For me, the seat comfort, direct aisle access, ratio of toilets, priority airport services with lounge access all have a much higher importance than the food and drinks (I don\u2019t like alcohol).",
                "The seats are the reason for business. Even if they don't recline all the way, there's more legroom and the seats are much more comfortable. It's a lot easier to go to the bathroom, even if you're in a window seat with someone next to you.\n\nIt's totally worth the upgrade price if you can swing it.\n\nFood is meh. Drinks are great.",
                "it would be worth it for me just so I could sleep/comfort.",
                "Yes the food sucks but the extra space rocks",
                "For me food is secondary, it\u2019s the lie flat seats that are amazing. So I wouldn\u2019t judge the upgrade for the food but for the comfort. However 800 is pretty steep for an upgrade, depends on your budget",
                "for 800. Yes.  Intercontinental in first class is the way.  Sometimes is 2-3k more for these seats so for 800 absolutely ( if it doesn't affect you to much financially).\n\nHopefully you can still drink lol.",
                "I always upgrade. Makes a world of difference. Particularly real lengthy flights",
                "I flew biz during June 2020. The food was a clear plastic bag with a Sammie and an apple. The seat lays flat and you can actually stretch out and try to sleep. \n\nPut another way\u2026\n\nThe meal they serve is probably about a $20-30 meal. The chair costs thousands and thousands.",
                "It is the ability to stretch out and sleep. I find that I am fully rested and ready to go if I travel on business class as compared to requiring an extra day of rest when traveling by cattle class",
                "I pick business for comfort. I don\u2019t eat the airplane food either way really.  But the space difference is worth it.",
                "Business class food is actually not that special (although it's decent and surely better than Economy). But the space and the ability to lay down... priceless.",
                "I wouldn\u2019t upgrade for a 10 hour flight. It is definitely worth it on an 18 hour flight as you can really feel the difference during and after, but for anything below 12 hours I wouldn\u2019t waste the money to upgrade as that\u2019s a lot of nice meals and events at wherever you\u2019re traveling to. I think getting anything similar to \u201ccomfort plus\u201d is always a good bang for your buck, but first class and business class are usually only worth it for longer flights from my experience.",
                "For a 10 hr flight, especially overnight, it is absolutely worth it.",
                "If money is not an issue, a business class where you can lay flat is 100% recommended. Food is not the main selling point for business class, it's the seat: spacious, quiet, and lay flat bed.",
                "I rarely eat airplane food regardless of the class Im flying. If the flight is over 5 hours, im buying business or first. It's all about how comfortable the seat and leg room are, and I'll pay because I can. For me, it's a priority. And if I fly domestic main, I'm paying to select my seat.",
                "I wish I could come with you and eat the food, not to even mention champagne, wines and cognac, if you are flying Air France business! \nFor France it\u2019s the showcase on their modest agricultural products;)\n\nAs others are pointing out, firstly it\u2019s about space and comfort.\n\nAnd the cheese (sniff)",
                "I flew business class my entire life (airline kid), when I grew up and had to fly coach, I realized how bad it was. \n\nIf you can afford the $800, go business!  It\u2019s worth it for the space and attention from the staff.",
                "Maybe I've been lucky but I seem pre-covid to always snag a seat that next to me is empty.  Mid East flights (I mostly fly over night) I would more than 50% of the time get a whole row to myself and crash out.",
                "I myself am a travel agent. I would suggest calling your airline and asking them about their individual perks. Because unless we know the airline and the specific information about your airline, we cannot really say what the particular perks are as they can vary by airline. But also, price it out. You aren't going to eat the food. So the individual perks that come with the upgrade, do they really equate to $800?",
                "I'm a fan of the \"free\" drinks, but otherwise no.  The massive benefit is the extra space and comfort.  For that, you can feed me peanut butter on celery; I'm happy.",
                "I think so! I couldn\u2019t care less about the food for me its about being able to lay flat!",
                "For me absolutely because I like the seat and the space. The possibility to sleep is golden. Of course it depends on your budget. Also depends on the airline\u2014 seat products vary wildly (even within airlines), so do your research.",
                "There are different business class products, is this a lie-flat seat?\nPersonally I don\u2019t care too much about the food. I want the early boarding, limited lines, overhead access, and more space between me and other people to relieve my anxiety. It\u2019s either fly first/business or don\u2019t fly, for me.",
                "Are you rich?\n\nIt entirely depends on how much $800 is to you. I wouldn't. I definitely wouldn't.",
                "splurge on the seat, you can ignore the food.  That being said, check their special meals you can select ahead.  Perhaps there is one that may have enough of an overlap with your dietary requirements that you can make do.  (still bring your snacks as a backup).",
                "If the money isn\u2019t an issue for you, then hell yes. It\u2019s so much more comfortable, so worth it for such a long flight.",
                "I would do it in a heartbeat.  I'm flying to Madrid next week and took the same delta for Biz class.  $800 upgrade is a really good deal IMO.\n\nYou will arrive in Paris feeling rested and ready to go and will actually get more out of your trip then flying coach.",
                "I never book biz class for the food or the alcohol. I know I will get flamed for this but I don\u2019t understand people who book for the drinks (or food). \n\nI book to lie flat , for the general space , and not to have to sit next to some fat / smelly/ rude person . I skip the meal on many intl flights.\n\nAnd ofc the check in.",
                "I couldn't care less about the food. I also don't care about check-in or anything like that. The bed is all I want and the only reason I upgrade occasionally.",
                "I rarely if ever eat the food on board.  Eat before in lounge and then sleep",
                "For me, it\u2019s a health issue. I\u2019m older now and retired. International flights in coach can really mess up my back.\nOn a lie flat, I can fly 15 hours and arrive refreshes and relatively pain free.\n\nThe food in biz is minor for me. All pretty meh\u2026.\n(International First is a different story tho :)",
                "If the seats lay-flat, absolutely! The experience is one should have at least once if you can afford it. The potential to sleep and wake up refreshed is worth it for me. \n\nI\u2019m fortunate enough to fly business class and won\u2019t do economy over 7 hours. I\u2019m spoiled not by the food but the chance to get some solid rest and wake up ready to go in my new destination.",
                "the seat alone is worth the upgrade.",
                "I'm well over 6' tall.  It's absolutely required for long flights because in coach I have to sit weird with my knees basically in between the seats in front of me and partially with my legs into the seats of the people next to me.  I can do that for an hour or so or two at most.",
                "It\u2019s not the food.  It\u2019s the space.  More room is what you\u2019re paying for.",
                "Who needs food when you can live your best life with fancy seats and extra luggage space? Enjoy, my friend!",
                "Being able to sleep comfortably and bounce back quicker are the main attractions.  The food\u2019s nice, but at most it\u2019s $100 worth of food.  The value is getting more space and the lie flat seat IMO.",
                "For a 10h flight I\u2019d absolutely pay $800 for the upgrade. \n\nI\u2019m currently trying to decide if it\u2019s worth $5000 and leaning no.",
                "Was once, never did it again\n\nWould be really interested in the deep down psychological motives of people that do",
                "The warm towels are worth the upgrade.",
                "Yeah",
                "Extra leg room makes a big difference on really long flights. Also in business class, flight are attendants are more attentive, so more water, less dehydration. It makes little difference on short flights, but on a flight to Bali, business class was worth it!",
                "Yes.  Because normally it would cost a lot more than $800 to upgrade to business for a 10 hour flight.  Take it.\n\nAside from better seats, on some airlines / plans, business class cabin is quieter, which helps with comfort.",
                "10 hour flight for 800$ upgrade is for sure worth it for me. Are you sure it's business? That seems very cheap",
                "The food is not the highlight as to why I book business in particular for an overnight flight. \n\nIt's the I get 2 checked luggage, the lounge access, the free alcohol, the lay down beds. \n\nThis is a a you decision to make, I as a stranger can't tell you what to do with your money. It's a bit strange to me that you want strangers to tell you what to do with your money.... I mean...",
                "It's the ability to lay down and sleep on a long haul flight for me!",
                "Everyone varies and there are tons of shades of grey between pinching pennies and doesn't look at price tags... I personally fly main cabin / comfort-plus for leisure travel. I book up-cabin for international business travel, particularly if I am going to need to be \"on\" quickly after arrival... like if I'm flying red eye and doing meetings that next day, I'm booking first class....",
                "If it\u2019s a lie-flat seat, it\u2019s worth it to me. The food was so bad last time I flew Air France business class, I didn\u2019t eat anyway.",
                "My rule of thumb is if the flight is more than about 6-8h I try to upgrade (even if said upgrade is just not using the cheapest airline, or from economy to extra legroom). Under 6h not worth it.",
                "The food is a non-factor. If the economy food is a 3/10, the business class food might be a 5/10. It\u2018s mostly about the comfort, getting a decent night\u2018s sleep to start off your trip rather that struggling to adjust for a day or two.\n\nHave you traveled this far before? If you have an uncomfortable flight, how would you rate \"yourself\" (meaning mood, energy, general well-being) for those first couple of days of the trip?\n\nIf you\u2019d be like 80%, and Business Class could make you 90%, that may not be worth it.\n\nIf you\u2019d be like 30%, and BC could make you 80%, that may be worth it.\n\nAlso depends on the length of the trip. If its 2 weeks, you could afford taking it easy for the first couple of days. If its 2 days (like a business trip, hence the name), you need to be in top shape as soon as you land, and it very likely is worth it.",
                "For me it\u2019s the seats, so I can actually get some sleep. I always put in upgrade bids.",
                "Don\u2019t ever let airplane food be a deciding factor for business class. Better to spend that money in the country itself. If you want more comfortable seats that\u2019s really the only reason.",
                "It may be a subjective opinion but I think premium economy is enough for a 10 hour flight. The 10 hr mark is the maximum while anything more is definitely worth business class.",
                "The only thing that matters to me is lie flat seating",
                "What do you value on a flight? Space, ease of check-in, fast track security, better seating\u2026 it\u2019s all up to you, but personally if I had the leisure money, yes.",
                "Only if it was an overnight flight for me",
                "Premium economy for international (5+ hour flight) is like getting an extra day of travel back. \n\nConsider what you\u2019re spending for the full trip and the extra cost to \u201cadd a day\u201d is probably worth it. Not sure I\u2019d go up to business class, as the extra leg room and seat positions on premium economy are good enough for me to feel comfortable (early 40\u2019s, decent health, 6\u20191\u201d).\n\nThe food situation is a bit better (and especially just getting (soft) drinks earlier and more frequently), but that wouldn\u2019t be the selling point for me.",
                "Seems fair. Every time I look at business or first class tickets across the Atlantic they\u2019re 5,000 dollars or more.",
                "I can't imagine any food being worth $800. \nThere's other benefits, but that's up to you on whether those are worth $800.",
                "Have you done a long haul business class flight before? If not, I say it's worth it for the experience of feeling bougie and just so you know that you've been there done that (although full disclosure, I'm an experience whore so I put a pretty high premium on new things)\n\nAlso $800 is pretty reasonable for a business class upgrade.\n\nAnd lastly, lay flat and extra room are nice is well. Better booze too, if you drink.",
                "Absolutely, I'd say it's worth it. Upgraded check-in, luggage allowance and 8 hours flying time with MORE ROOM!",
                "I spent $600 per person to upgrade myself and my husband from Europe to the US not too long ago. I would\u2019ve paid even more for the opposite tbh, because having a lie-flat bed on the overnight flight rather than the daytime return would\u2019ve been even better. But it was absolutely worth it to me and I don\u2019t think I can ever travel across an ocean in economy again. $600 is a lot of money, yes, but it\u2019s not a bank breaking amount for me right now. I realize I\u2019m quite fortunate in that respect. It wasn\u2019t even about the food, although the food was pretty good. It\u2019s the space and comfort, and the elevated check in experience with the lounge and all that. My husband has back problems and being able to lie down was super helpful for him. We\u2019re in our late 20s, so we\u2019re not very old with all sorts of bodily ailments. But it was still very much worth it imo. We are fortunate that our financial situation means we didn\u2019t have to choose between the upgrade and fun stuff on the trip. We were able to do both comfortably.",
                "I have a colon condition so I sympathize but the food isn\u2019t even the reason I upgrade to business class whenever it\u2019s financially viable for me (I\u2019m willing to pay up to $1,000 Canadian extra for business class). I just flew KLM (Air France partner) for Europe to Canada flight and was worth $1k for me. Being able to lie flat is AMAZING and being able to stand up whenever you want without bothering another person is awesome! And no long waits for bathrooms.\nA nice extra is being able to bring extra carry on weight so can basically skip checking a bag, so no waiting for luggage at other end.\nALSO, business class lounge is a great, especially for a layover! Lots of space. \nI think my financial situation is similar and my advice is go for it!",
                "If it means you are getting a lay flat seat absolutely do it. If it only means a slightly bigger seat with a bit more recline have a look at premium economy.",
                "I only fly business on international flights. NOTHING to do with the food. It's the priority boarding, lounges, the comfort of being able to lie down to sleep .",
                "rule of thumb, anything over 5 hours, if you can afford it, upgrade to better seats. if you cannot, ask, you never know.",
                "If you can afford it, it is 100% worth it. Be forewarned though, you\u2019ll never be able to look at economy seats the same.",
                "The food is a lot better than it is in economy, but it is not like going to a fancy restaurant. It's just decent food. You're mostly paying for space on the plane and some other niceties. The food in the lounge at the airport is likely to be better.\n\nHigh end food exists on planes, but not on something like air Canada.\n\n$800 more to fly business on a long flight isn't crazy. If 6ou want to sleep a bit and be comfortable it is quite possibly worth it.\n\nAnd while you might not eat the food, you're missing out on something that would probably cost $30 on the ground.",
                "I can't really answer, but i did a premium economy on air france recently that was alright.  More foot space, seat reclines a bit more / elevates your legs....  was out for 9 of the 12 hours.  Usually my ass really hurts.  Still happened, but significantly less..    Best part was the perks carried to my second leg, which was just economy.",
                "100%. I rarely eat on flights, especially long haul to counter jet lag anyway. It just the seat, ease of check in and lounge ( in that order) that make it worth it for me.",
                "Wow people here value the upgrade! The last time I flew to paris was in April. Flew basic economy on delta. Flights were roughly $1k/person. $800 would be close to financing a second trip. If I asked myself if I would rather go to paris twice or lay down flat, I would choose to go twice. It\u2019s absolutely about what is worth it for you. Every meal we had on that trip was over $200/person. That\u2019s what we like to spend on. Our hotel was small and adequate at $120/night.",

He flies business and first class, and has the cabin crew warm up his own meals for him before he eats it. The man does not touch airplane food.",
                "I think if your health issues could affect how comfortable you might be it\u2019s work upgrading. 10 hours is a long time. If you don\u2019t want to spend as much money you can look at booking a seat in an exit row or a row with more legroom as this can make a huge difference. I also recommend sitting in an aisle seat for a long flight like this, that way you can stand up and move around whenever you want without disturbing anyone. Have a great time in Paris!",
                "Yes, to sleep",
                "I think it\u2019s worth it. Not for the food, but just for the extra space.",
                "Yes absolutely. You get to lie flat, have a side table and cabinet, usually a coat/purse hanger, and a decent amount of privacy. The bathrooms are bigger and cleaner with amenities. It feels very relaxing. $800 extra for a transatlantic flight is totally worth it IMO.",
                "I do for the privacy, hopefully lack of kids, and lie flat seats. \n\nFood is great and a fun addition.",

                "Yes so worth it- right from the get go the flying and transit experience in the airport is so much better. To name a few: little to no lines at customs and immigration, baggage allowance, getting to be away from the crowds, laying flat and having personal space on the plane, (depending on the airline) better service and quality of interactions.",

The novelty of the food wears off quickly (and it\u2019s not even that nice most of the time, just better than economy).\n\nFor $800 and 10 hours it would be worth it for me so long as the plane had a bed.",
                "Depending on the plane, the seat may recline 135 to 180 degrees so it is really more comfortable for a long flight.\nIn terms of Menu, air france has plenty of options for restricted diets.\nAlso their champagne us really good.",
                "The food sucks and can't compare to what you'd get in a cheap restaurant on terra firma. The lie flat seats are the key. Better make sure Air France isn't using a shitty aircraft for this route. \n\nI've had good experience on Air France in the past.",
                "Yeah, I\u2019m paying for the seat every time. Nothing like lying flat, watching the stars at night. I\u2019ve got ulcerative colitis amongst other autoimmune greatest hits, so the toilet access is also key. There\u2019s also a lot to be said for arriving at your destination in human rather than zombie condition. I\u2019m not that obsessed with food and I don\u2019t drink alcohol so while edible food is a perk, it\u2019s no motivator for me. Do it if you can afford it, and have fun \ud83e\udd29",
                "I think a lot of people in Business would take the cash difference to sit in Economy because they're using miles or work is paying.",
                "The food is not worth it if you are flying air canada or air france. if you drink, still not worth it. The seat is nice tho, depending on how much 800 is worth to you",
                "I also deal w/ chronic health issues that restrict what I can eat, and business is a non-negotiable for me when going overseas. I value the real sleep, comfortable ride, priority access/no waiting in lines, and easy restroom access, very highly. The food is a wonderful experience (my husband enjoys it!) but the comfort and convenience is why I upgrade.... and key to managing my health well during a trip",
                "I think the food isn't what makes the difference, it's the seats. \n\nEven boarding doesn't make the huge difference to me, because the plane leaves when it leaves and whether I board first and wait there or wait before boarding doesn't matter that much to me personally.\n\nBut the one time I flew first class, it was comfortable as shit. It was an overnight, pretty long flight, and we had gotten these upgrades as a farewell gift from my dad's work (we lived in a different country for his work and this was the last flight back home after it ended) and the seats were like beds. It was comfortable and nice and it was the first and only time I ever actually slept on a plane and even felt rested after, and it was just a lot more spacious. \n\nI'm kinda cheap, so I've never had such a nice flying experience again, but it definitely makes a difference IF you're in a plane that actually has different seats.",
                "It depends how much the money means to you. When I was a poor college student backpacking Europe I wouldn\u2019t spend even $200 to upgrade a 15 hour flight. Now days I\u2019d probably say it\u2019s worth it.\n\nBusiness class is nice and when you get off the flight you\u2019re better rested, in a better mood and more ready to go. If you have a short time to spend in a destination and money isn\u2019t a huge concern the money can be well worth it.",
                "Timely! I just returned from a 15 hour away international destination. I elected to go with premium economy and pocketed the cash. The memory of the two flights is long long behind me, even now, just a week later and I have the cash I would have spent in my pocket to spend on my family. It's really personal preference but having flown more long haul (15+ hour flights) than I can even remember (at least once or twice a year for 20 years) I always just take the hit and save my money, over the years that would add up to hundreds of thousands. I am healthy, with no back issues to speak of and I'm 5\"10 so that helps too. I'm closing in on 50 so potentially if I start getting aches and pains I might switch to Business but until then, that's my deal. Good luck and safe travels.",
                "not really worth 800 unless you have problems sitting in a regular seat. thats almost 2 intercontinental round-trips in economy. the food is definitely never worth an upgrade.",
                "Yes absolutely",
                "In my mind with business class you're paying primarily for the space. You get a flat bed in the sky. That's amazing.\n\nI must admit, I do make the most of the booze and the food when I fly business, but that's secondary. I also like the experience on the ground - fast track check-in is nice, although lounges can run from \"one of the best experiences of my life\" to \"completely forgettable and I wish I hadn't bothered,\" depending on the airport and airline.\n\nSo, over 10 hours, is it worth it to you to pay $800 for a flat bed in the sky?",
                "The food is nothing special, first class is something different. But business is the seat, check in, baggage allowance and overall smooth experience so yes it\u2019s always worth it",
                "Sounds like a good deal. Does Air France do proper \"Business Class\"? Not like some that are more just like Premium Economy in good airlines. \n\nBut Business Class is great, utilise the Lounge before also. Enjoy!",
                "If you\u2019re going to miss the money don\u2019t upgrade",
                "800$ is literally half of my monthly paycheck. Paying extra 800$ to get to the same place seems like a waste.",
                "I do it more for sleep and rest on international or essentially anything longer than 7+ hours nonstop. Im also migraine prone and this helps to mitigate by getting more rest. I\u2019ve never been able to sleep in economy sitting. I\u2019m US based and go on 5-7 of these vacations annually. If you have the budget for it and can be more comfortable for whatever your needs may be then do it.\n\nBut once you try it, going back will be hard. You have been warned.",
                "Yes!!!! Missing out on the food will be a bummer, but the impact being able to get some real sleep will have on jet lag is absolutely worth it. You\u2019ll get more days at the start of your trip where you\u2019re not completely wrecked- I would absolutely consider $800 a worthwhile investment to make that upgrade!",
                "Air France biz class is great, but yeah, it\u2019s most defining characteristic is superior food to most others. For me though, the fully flat seat that allows me to get actual REM sleep is what sells me any business class ticket. I can often manage to avoid jet lag almost entirely and hit the ground running on my trip. This is why I just fly economy home though; I don\u2019t really care if I\u2019m a little tired as I re-enter my routine back home.",
                "I fly business but never because of the food. That\u2019s your issue?",
                "Having a fully reclined seat and hanging out in the lounge before take off is 100% worth it in my opinion, unless it is completely out of your budget of course.",
                "There's a lot of factors when deciding to upgrade. What are the perks your airline gives? Check in benefits, extra baggage, lay down flat seats, priority boarding, and as you mentioned... food.  \n\n\nAll of this is so subjective. But since you mentioned food as your driving factor, I have a hard time believing airplane food (regardless of class) would be worth paying an additional $800. I'd pocket the money and spend it on food/fun in France.",
                "it is always 100% worth it to upgrade to business class if you can afford it. \n\nI\u2019ve honestly been on flights so good I didn\u2019t want to get off when I\u2019d gotten to my location lol. that does not happen in coach\n\n\nETA:  for me personally, this is not apply to Delta premium select, if that is what you consider business class. I hate those seats! I honestly find comfort plus seats in the first row after PS (tons of legroom) MUCH more comfortable than premium select",
                "Thirteen hour flights in economy are standard for me. Two glasses of wine & a paracetamol and you\u2019ll be fine."

Have a great weekend. \n \n> An Assistant Professor in our department posted on Facebook saying that he\u2019s married to a female, who turned out to be a first year year PhD student in the same department - the female\u2019s name in on the list of graduate students of the departmental website.  It\u2019s clear that they have the tacit support from the department, or they seem to be married BEFORE her admission.  Anyone who knows her thinks that she doesn\u2019t have the capability or caliber to do well in a competitive PhD program.  I\u2019m a graduate student and I know the professor has friends who can hurt my career and life prospects.

                "Ok, so some comments dug in LAOP's post history to find how much of an asshole he is because he hates women, other races, poor people etc. Sure. But I want to give my insight as a mathematician and programmer!\n\nIn some thread that I didn't read, he posted this:\n\n>How come coding is difficult?  You\u2019re a mathematician.  Nowhere in coding is there anything more difficult than Sylow theorem.  The toughest part of C++ people find is pointers, which is understandable within an hour...\n\nWhere to even begin?\n\nLAOP is obviously *not* a good programmer - otherwise they'd know code written by people from any other discipline, mathematicians included, is usually terrible.\n\nSylow theorem is a theorem from group theory taught in the first year of a maths degree. LAOP thinks it's immensely hard because he has never taken a more advanced maths course. Yet he talks as if he has any understanding of maths.\n\nPointers in C++ are not used that much. On the contrary, they're a mostly C feature that's usually replaced by other constructs in C++. And I don't know a single person who'd describe them as the hardest part of it. Try debugging a code with templates and come back.\n\nTo summarize, LAOP is incredibly confident in multiple things he has no idea about.",

I don't think LAOP is a graduate student since they don't understand what it means to be an ASSISTANT professor. \n\nLAOP is obviously trying to derail her career not solely due to worries about the \"conflict of interest\" of her admission.",

                "The way he's talking, good chance he lands himself a Title IX complaint of his own. If he's as stupid as his posting history suggests, he might even get himself bounced.\n\nProfessors dating their students is gross, and in many places gets them fired. But a major caveat to this is a preexisting relationship. One that is properly disclosed to people isn't likely to trigger any sort of odd looks. Especially if the Prof is only an Assistant Professor, which AFAIK means they aren't going to be mentoring PhD Students of their own till they get tenure (assuming they do get tenure). So the possibility of conflict is diminished on that front too. Its also worth considering that plenty of people enter PhDs fairly late in life. So there's no reason to assume any sort of age gap here either. Infact they might have come from very similar professional standings. A PhD getting involved with a school teacher in the field who then decides to get their own doctorate for instance is exactly how you could get into this relationship.",

I think the other commenters here don\u2019t really get what you\u2019re saying, because they fit the description.  Your observations about the people you\u2019ve met are, in fact, correct: people lack drive, agency, and independent thought.  They don\u2019t want to listen to you because they operate in slave morality, as Nietzsche explained.  \n\nThe answer to your question is simply that you are meeting the meaner and baser part of the society.  Your social class is not high enough.  If you manage to improve your standing in the society and interact with the elites, you\u2019ll feel better about the people around you.  \n\nSince you have been gifted with drive and independent thought, then bring yourself to a better place.  Don\u2019t be frustrated by the stupidity of the people around you.  Be frustrated by the fact that you are among them, and change it.  Don\u2019t try to change anyone.  Get out of the bad places that you\u2019re in.  \n\nOnce you enter the circle of elites, people would not even bother to debate that the dumb people are dumb as it is shared knowledge.  There, nobody would ever criticise this obvious observation as arrogant.  It\u2019s possible to escape the stupid people if you work hard, and man you\u2019ll feel free, at home with your own people, and finally liberated.\"",

If I was jury, the verdict would still be out. The kid, he\u2019s got one foot in, he\u2019s got one foot out. These fans, they are rabid. They want to know if you\u2019re here to stay, man. They ain\u2019t looking for no part-timers. We ain\u2019t looking for guys that just want to hang around and look good. No, you gotta get in there and show me something, son.

Not that Gable Steveson isn\u2019t, but I really think Gable Steveson has some unfinished business still left in the amateurs, I think he got unfinished business in the Olympics. That right there, that\u2019s a legacy in itself. For him to be a two-time Olympic gold medalist, come on. That\u2019s the Wheaties box. He\u2019s never got to do nothing ever again in his life. So I understand.\u201d",
                "Damn. This might be the biggest sign Gable might not be around much longer. Booker has said something's you wouldn't expect but he's always been a company man. Him burying one of wwes most hyped signings says a lot. Dude must really suck in & out the ring.",

                "Even if you take out the obvious problematic issues with Steveson, it's already an uphill climb if you're constantly comparing him to Kurt Angle, an all-time anomaly who had impeccable credentials, but was also an instant natural when it came to the physical aspects of the sport and then had an all-time great personality to match. That comparison should be out the window right from the start. \n\nThe problem is even independent of Angle comparisons, he's clearly not picking it up particularly well. With his notoriety, WWE would have shotgunned a push for him if he was showing even baseline competence that they could work around (basically the WWE version of AEW pushing Hook) and they haven't done it, which speaks volumes.\n\nHonestly he'd probably be better off if they stuck a gimmick on him like they did with his brother instead of having to be famous gold medal wrestler Gable Steveson.",

He hasn\u2019t picked up after several years, doesn\u2019t seem interested in doing so, he\u2019s a legit rapist so the fans will never be fully behind him, and what\u2019s stopping more victims coming forward if he starts building s name for himself, resulting in a scandal?

Gable Steveson signed a couple of years ago and did some stuff at the Performance Center, but he's mostly been out doing appearances for his brand/NIL stuff while trying to keep up with his training on the road.\n\nIt will be interesting to see if Steveson can make the transition into WWE or if his other projects will continue to be a distraction.",

If it's true that Steveson is not as passionate for pro wrestling as Angle was, then all that raw potential (Olympic gold medalist and NCAA Champion, as successful as Angle and Lesnar respectively were) would not materialize. Steveson could really be a face of the WWE if he commits to this, so I hope he does finish whatever business he has left.",

This is probably the most obvious way of saying they're married without saying that they're married. Deniers can claim that it's a business thing (and they were business partners in Gund-Arm) but the importance of Holder in this context is to be Miorone's groom, so why start the line with that if not to imply the relationship, and Suletta doesn't seem to be involved with Gund-Arm in the epilouge.

Ron DeSantis's war against\u00a0The Walt Disney Co.\u00a0has impacted the state's biggest tourism attraction and is leading to a broader backlash that could seriously hurt the state's economy.\n\nDeSantis, a right-wing candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, singled out Disney because of its LGBTQ+ values and inclusivity, which he disagrees with. In response, California Gov. Gavin Newsom has seized the opportunity to embrace Disney for its diversity, making his state a more\u00a0attractive option\u00a0for Disney's future investments.\n\nDon\u2019t Miss:\n\nFormer Disney CEO Bob Chapek opposed DeSantis's so-called \"Don't Say Gay\" legislation, triggering the clash between the company and the governor.\n\nAlthough Florida is home to other left-leaning companies, they have not explicitly targeted DeSantis. As part of his \"war on woke\" campaign, DeSantis took control of the Reedy Creek Improvement District, the special taxing district for the Disney resort's land, resulting in legal battles and strained relations with the entertainment giant.\n\nIn May, Disney made headlines when it canceled a\u00a0$1 billion project\u00a0to construct an office campus and transfer 2,000 employees to Orlando. The company also pulled the plug on a promising Star Wars hotel that had only been operational at Disney World for a short time.\n\nThese actions were followed by pointed remarks from Disney CEO Bob Iger, who criticized DeSantis, branding him as \"anti-business\" and \"anti-Florida.\"\n\nDisney has turned its focus to a new endeavor known as Disneyland Forward. The program is aimed at rejuvenating its two theme parks in Anaheim, California. The company envisions Disneyland Forward as a catalyst for significant growth, projecting an annual revenue of $253 million and the creation of more than 2,200 new jobs.\n\nThe consequences of DeSantis's actions are not limited to the Disney dispute. Florida's political climate, characterized by controversial policies concerning LGBTQ rights and race, has led to a growing number of conventions and conferences avoiding the state altogether. At least\u00a0five groups\u00a0have\u00a0canceled\u00a0or moved their events out of Orange County and Fort Lauderdale over concerns about the state's policies.\n\nFlorida's tourism industry is displaying broader signs of decline, particularly in the Orlando area. The Orange County comptroller's office reported a\u00a06.7% decrease\u00a0in tourist development tax collections for May compared to the previous year, marking the second consecutive decrease since February 2021.\n\nHotel occupancy in the Orlando area during May was down by\u00a02.5% year over year. Analysts also point out that crowds in Walt Disney World over the July 4 holiday were the\u00a0lowest\u00a0they've been in nearly a decade, a trend also affecting rival theme park Universal Orlando Resort. Factors contributing to the decline include families transitioning away from theme parks as the pent-up demand following the COVID-19 pandemic subsided and visitors are displeased about widespread price increases at Disney's theme parks.\n\nThe combination of political controversies and other factors is creating a challenging environment for local businesses and officials who rely on the thriving tourism sector. The implications extend beyond the Disney-DeSantis feud and raise questions about the long-term sustainability of Florida's tourism-driven economy.\n\nSee more on\u00a0startup investing\u00a0from Benzinga:",

                "Honestly the only reason I don't use it anymore is because of people like [this.](https://i.imgur.com/o8R0YxC.png) A user that explicitly says right in their own bio that they don't even use the site anymore for its intended purpose. The only thing they do is police other users' content.\n\nI know that some people really do need help asking decent questions and providing enough context. Maybe I'm not an English professor but I certainly know how to lay out a question, show the things I've tried, and distill a problem down to the simplest form I can in order to ask the right questions.\n\nThat user and others like them do not edit questions for the sake of readability or clarity. They do it because they are bored. It might be cheesy but I used to love seeing Stack notifications. I knew I'd either gotten interaction with one of my questions or feedback on one of my answers and it was always a joy to open those notifications up and engage with other devs.\n\nNow, and I'm not exaggerating, 99% of my notifications are for edits. At least 60-70% of those edits are from 3-4 users, with at least 50% of that being the one user I mentioned earlier.\n\n[A peek at my notifications from the last week.](https://i.imgur.com/ObQScNj.png) Keeping in mind that I've posted maybe one or two things in the last 3-4 years. This is a taste of how many edit notifications I get on content that I submitted YEARS ago and all of those are from the same user whose bio I showed above.\n\nMaybe it's petty of me but it's really irritating. And there is no recourse without fighting a massive uphill meta community battle against a slew of users who do nothing but live in that space. They are insistent that Stack Overflow be completely devoid of human things like \"thanks in advance for any help!\" or \"I've been banging my head against this for hours so any help is very appreciated <3\". Anything human gets edited out. It wouldn't bother me so much if it was just every now and then, but it's constant. I get multiple notifications a week, sometimes daily. I even wrote [a script](https://gist.github.com/CatDadCode/49a4c6e435bcb6171db5157d04760d1d#file-edits-from-user-js) that compiled a list of all the posts of mine this one user has edited and it's over 100 posts.\n\nEvery time I think they must have edited every last post I've ever made they find another one. I'm reminded of particularly annoying HOA members that really have nothing better to do than harass people who are living in the spirit of the rules. Like, if I tear up my yard and never do anything about it then sure, I would expect to be fined for leaving my yard a wreck. But if I put a pile of fresh dirt on the edge of my yard, clearly intended for landscaping, and I get a fine for having it there for one night then that's pretty insulting and stupid, right? That's how Stack Overflow feels to me now. I'm operating in good faith and literally generating content for the site, and they foster a community of busybodies that walk around with laminated copies of the rules so they can shove it in your face if you dare say one word against it.\n\nNot worth it in a day where I can join developer subreddits, discord servers, etc. I totally agree that LLMs are engaged in some shady practices, but IMO Stack was a husk of its former self long before that. I don't think it's quite as simple as saying AI is the reason Stack is dead or dying.",

Since then, [the company's fiscal year-end results came out](https://prosus-ir.com/results/2023/Prosus-annual-results-2023/pdf/booklet.pdf).

The two-time Red Bull world champion tells us so in an exclusive interview with FORMULE 1 Magazine. \n\nVerstappen is targeting his own team in the GT3 class with Verstappen.com Racing and hopes it can be operational as early as 2025. \"This project gives me energy,\" he says. \n\n**Tell us exactly what the Verstappen.com Racing project involves?**\n\n\"It is still somewhat in its infancy right now. From Verstappen.com Racing we sponsor and support in advice and consultancy various racing activities of people close to me. It all started with Team Redline's sim racing. In addition, we are now active with Verstappen.com Racing with Thierry Vermeulen in DTM and GTWC Sprint and with my father in rallying, but the ultimate goal is to set up our own racing team. We will start in the GT3 class and then at some point we will see where the ship runs aground. If it does strand...\"  \n\n\"If I do something, I want to do it well. I want to win, even with this. And it's about being able to create a stepping stone from sim racing into GT3. So that you can't just end up in motor racing via karting, because that costs a lot of money at the moment.\"\n\n**And ambitions for the future, assuming that a GT3 team of his own is the first step?** \n\n\"Well, of course you never know how things will turn out, but ambitions are always there. It depends, of course, on how many good people we will soon have in the team and how much know-how there is, but it would be nice if we can grow to the highest level in long-distance racing.\"  \n\n**Do you have a timeframe in mind when it comes to the further development of Verstappen.com Racing?**\n\n\"We are working hard on that at the moment. The next step is our own GT3 team. Next year is pretty tight, but I do want it as soon as possible. A GT3 team in 2025, that should be possible. With at least two cars then.\"  \n\n**You're talking about 2025, which is already very soon.** \n\n\"We are also in full swing. The planning phase is over, we are already in action mode.\"",

            "title": "\u2018Why is (fill in the blank business) service so slow right now??\u2019 -From a downtown Seattle luxury hotel employee",
            "selftext": "This is coming up a lot lately, either in person at my work, or on Reddit, or in conversation at bars/restaurants from non service industry people, and as I\u2019m sitting here on my day off, I can explain what I\u2019m witnessing firsthand. Seattle is one of the more expensive cities in the country, and as a result, has a lot of people who relocate here to work in highly skilled/desired positions which naturally earn high income. Duh. We all know that. \n\nAnd that\u2019s great. But we can\u2019t ONLY have those positions in Seattle. Like any city, we need people to work at our restaurant/bars, airports, grocery stores, gyms, delivery drivers, retail, coffee shops, delis, hotels, etc.. \n\nAt most of these places, the customers expect the employees to treat them with at least average to higher level customer service. But at the end of the day, all of these positions are more or less minimum wage. And as a result, people who make only minimum wage (~$18.70/hr) can\u2019t afford to live in Seattle independently as higher earners have inflated the housing market, and rent continues to increase every year we have to renew our lease, with no end in sight. So the people serving you who have been on their feet working for 10 straight hours, often times with 3 or more to go, while making minimum wage, are often less than excited about going above and beyond to give you your best experience, knowing that the majority of the profits are for their employer. \n\nThe employees know they\u2019re short staffed, as they\u2019re frequently asked to stay late or cover shifts, and we also know our employers desperately need us because they can\u2019t find anybody to hire. People are legitimately walking out mid shift after dealing with an impatient customer. So as a result, the service drops because they\u2019re overworked, underpaid, and there\u2019s little risk of repercussion. We can\u2019t really get fired unless we do something next level atrocious because they have nobody else to hire. And going through an entirely new training process for a new employee that\u2019ll likely quit after a couple shifts isn\u2019t worth it. \n\nThe increased cost of living in Seattle doesn\u2019t allow for minimum wage employees to live here independently unless they have side income or help from their family, so very few people living in Seattle are applying for physically demanding, high stress, low pay positions. As a result, you get employees who are students, or in between jobs in hopes of landing something more lucrative and will only be there temporarily, or ESL which often upsets the customer because there\u2019s a language barrier. \n\n\u2018But you guys get tipped!\u2019 Yeah, sometimes. But society hates tipping culture more and more every day because \u2018it shouldn\u2019t be my responsibility to pay the employees wage! The employer should.\u2019 And that\u2019s absolutely right. It shouldn\u2019t be the guests responsibility. Tipping culture is fucked up and has gotten way out of hand. \n\nOn paper I make about $19/hr, but add that with the cash I go home with and sometimes it\u2019s more like $50/hr. Or sometimes it\u2019s $30/hr. Or sometimes $40. Or sometimes $20. It\u2019s all kind of a gamble and I never really know what to expect. But the reality is that without monetary incentive (tips), service industry employees today have very little interest in optimizing your experience as a guest. We\u2019re exhausted and simply don\u2019t get paid enough to care, all while not really needing to fear losing our jobs. \n\nSeattle is an expensive city where service industry employees are burned out and earning very little relative to the cost of living, which makes it difficult for employers to staff; and as a result, the level of service declines and will continue to do so. \n\nSo what\u2019s the solution to this problem?? Employers simply need to pay their employees more, and stop relying solely on customers to pay employees livable wages. Once employers start doing that, they will notice that they\u2019ll be getting more qualified, excited to work employees to apply for their companies, and customers will be far more satisfied with their experience. Until that happens, the service industry, especially the luxury hotel industry from my experience, is on the verge of collapse.",

At least with restaurants, my understanding is profit margins (which have always been thin in that industry) are even narrower after the pandemic. If they pay servers more, food prices go up. Prices for eating out are already quite high, which is one of the things fueling diner frustration.\n\nWhere is the money going? Yes, some of it is going to well-paid line level tech workers. But those people are mostly *spending* their income and putting it back into the city. The larger problem is corporate profits. Washington has one of the most regressive tax codes in the country. And the US as a whole has gotten more regressive with taxes on the extremely wealthy and corporations since Reagan was in office.\n\nThe solution is *taxes*. Taxes on corporations. Taxes on extreme wealth. We don't need billionaires for society to function. They can be, I don't know, hundred-millionaires, and the world will still turn just as well.\n\nPaying servers more will raise prices, which will mean even fewer middle class people are able to eat out, and the restaurant industry will tip even more towards a plaything of the rich.

I've seen discussions on this from people in different parts of the country online and also people that moved here from elsewhere in the last couple years. It's like the whole country's running on a skeleton crew. When the pandemic hit, retail stores and restaurants realized they could get by on these skeleton crews and just never replenished their staff.

                "The one part of your post that didn\u2019t really land with me, and it\u2019s central to your thesis, is that high income tech jobs are part of the problem.\n\nI spend a lot of my time in a much poorer area in Louisiana where it\u2019s even harder for a waiter to afford a house. Yes rent is cheaper there, but waiters earn much less. The only exception is New Orleans which has a thriving service industry thanks to tourists.  The smaller towns in Louisiana are paying waiters $2/hour, tips aren\u2019t great, and you\u2019re lucky to have a job at all.  So I don\u2019t buy the narrative that high income tech jobs are making it worse in Seattle. From my own experience I see first-hand it\u2019s better in Seattle than it is in towns whose economies aren\u2019t thriving.\n\nI agree it\u2019s far too difficult for far too many people to afford a comfortable lifestyle. That\u2019s an income inequality problem, a capitalism and taxation problem, not a tech jobs problem.  Seattle\u2019s thriving tech industry brings in a ton of money to the area which makes us more able to give everyone a higher quality of life. \n\nWe should be grateful for all the incoming money. The alternative, to NOT have those resources coming into our region, is even worse. The problem is it isn\u2019t being taxed and distributed well. We should be grateful for Amazon, Microsoft and others \u2014 and tax the hell out of the biggest winners, to spend on initiatives that make life better for everyone.\n\nWashington\u2019s inability to income tax is wild. Property tax is OK, but not enough. Capital gains is a good start, hopefully it sticks. Income tax is the best and our stupid constitution protects the rich from it.",

They want a fleet of minimum wage slaves to make them money. \n\nSomeone pointed out this is not just a Seattle problem, and this is true. Whether you're making $2 an hour as a server in a lower COL state or $15 here, you're not going to have any kind of future that involves savings, wealth growth, home ownership, or retirement. \nWhat blows my mind is some people will STILL argue that jobs that require doing are deserving of that kind of poverty. 53 million people in our 150 million person US workforce make $15 an hour or less, and most of them that are jobs that, if everyone just left to find something better, would mean the collapse of our entire way of life overnight. \n\nWe can't tax our way out of it. We can't legislate our way out of it. It's a fundamental problem with the system of capital and ownership. And the people who own everything will do everything in their power to keep you from ever meaningfully changing any of this under the power of the law.

Your issues would likely be solved. \n\nIf everyone got paid more, you'd be in the same situation you are in now. The problem with housing, for example, isn't that you're not rich enough to afford housing. The problem with housing is that there simply is not enough housing.\n\nLetting people bid bigger numbers for the same supply (by increasing pay) doesn't automatically cause an increase in supply. Housing is far from a truly free market. An increase in housing demand does not automatically cause an increase in housing supply.\n\nMore money for just you fixes your housing problem. More money for everyone just causes inflation of housing prices. \n\nThis is exactly what Seattle is seeing. Demand goes up, supply is not increasing to match. You can tell, because prices for housing are so high. The price increases are your evidence. \n\nWashington state is short well over a million units of housing since the 90s.

            "selftext": "So my 18 year old neighbour has been running a car detailing business from home for a couple of years now.\n\nIt stared off small, so maybe 1 car a day 3/4 times a week and is now about 7/8 cars a day almost every day. He does a range of services from a simple external wash to steam cleaning and washing the seats and engine cleaning and makes a fair bit of money from it.\n\nThe main issue is the fact that the way he is operating is illegal and breaks the environmental protection laws. He washes the cars on the street and lets the dirty water and chemicals go into the main street drains. Here in the UK, to do so is illegal, although councils will turn a blind eye if it's your own personal car.\n\nHowever, car wash businesses are normally held under even stricter rules and have to store waste water separately and send it off for treatment due to the chemicals before it can be disposed of.\n\nWhilst I haven't been bothered with his business, we are currently entering drought conditions and with him washing cars all day and paying a residential rate as opposed to business water rates, this is something which is making me think double about this.\n\nSo WIBTA, if I reported him for breaking the law?\n\nEdit: Thanks to those who have given some advice on how I should go about this instead of just reporting him\n\nI will speak to let him know about the legalities of the situation instead of just reporting him and figure out what his plans are.\n\nThe restrictions on commercial car washes are there for a reason and those of you who are saying that businesses and water companies do it, so it doesn't matter, are the reason why this world is in the state it is in.\n\nAlso, this is not some teenager making money from his parents' drive. It's a proper commercial operation. He had professional car washing equipment, a full business social media presence, a registered company, google maps business page and more\n\nEdit 2: For those saying he will be moving out soon or raising money for college/ university. He doesn't plan to go to university, as he wants to do this full time as well as expand on the car lease side of his business.\n\nHis parents are supportive of him being self-employed running a business from home as opposed to further education, as his older brother used to run a business buying/selling cars from home before the pandemic and up until last year his dad had been running a factory in the UK which had been producing clothes for the likes of boohoo, primark and others for over 30 years",

They had 14 seasons and almost all seasons were amazing. Us also, with here and there but the vision is lacking. I mean we have huge infrastructural support no? Still we are struggling.\n\n2) I've been listening to a lot of independent Pakistani Artists/Musicians/Singers lately, thanks to the last season. Artist like Talha Ajnum, Maanu, Hasan Raheem, Abdullah Siddiqui, Fariah Shafi and many more. They are coming up with bangers, super lyrics, great music and budgeted videos. Makes a lot of noise and stays with you forever. Why are we left behind in the game when it comes to Indie Scene as well? Always wondered if we have a huge fam following and good technical/infra support, still why are we not producing something which stays for long rather than just grabbing attention-scene.",

It had it's issues but it's design was such a breath of fresh air in what seems like a constant trudge of poorly done hyper-realism in games. \n\nIt was vivid, majestic, serene, and menacing and I was always interested to see what the next area would bring. The characters were likeable and were written with an air of mystery around their stories that I really ***wanted*** to learn what happened to them.\n\nThere were definitely some STEEP difficulty spikes that could be fine tuned better (i'm looking at you final boss) but finishing the game in spite of those difficulties was extremely rewarding.",

My only qualms are the mechanics feel pretty bad, the bosses seem really difficult and the story or characters could use some better writing. While I enjoy the originality of the story idk if it's Kena or other characters but it's just failing to really capture me. I've still got to beat the last boss but so far the only characters I cared for have been the first boss. \n\nI've really enjoyed the world that was created, the art style, character designs, the level up system and much more. The Karma system is nice, while I enjoy doing whatever puzzles I can anyway I feel a little more incentivized to look a little harder for puzzles, which is something I wouldn't normally do in other games. \n\nI'm glad to hear that they are working on another project. I would also like them to make another Zelda cinematic video. That's what put this company on my radar after all!",

Platforming and puzzles were and balanced enough not to frustrate you. \n\nThe combat was the only part I found out was lacking a little bit of polish, while the enemy variations were good and the whole Rots mechanics in battle spiced things up, it felt clunky sometimes, if and when it gets a sequel, I hope they  properly refine that aspect of it.",

But lately my boss has been really on me about using the beds, every time I\u2019ve seen him he\u2019s made a comment about how i\u2019m pale (I maintain my self tan once a week, I\u2019m not pale, I\u2019m just not Italian like every other girl that works here). Now he\u2019s wanting me to tan twice a week until further notice. I\u2019m currently looking for another job so it\u2019s not the end of the world but I was genuinely wondering, is this legal ? (New York)\n\nEDIT - I feel like there are few things I should mention. \n- Yes we offer spray tans but they are not free to employees, I refuse to give my boss money for that, I don\u2019t get paid enough. \n- To those saying I should be compensated for my time tanning if it\u2019s required, I\u2019m not. All employees have to tan off the clock. I don\u2019t drive so he even told me that \u201cI need to start telling my rides that they need to patiently wait for me to tan\u201d. \n- Also to the hidden camera comments, the reason he knows I\u2019m not tanning is our computer system tracks every client\u2019s purchase and tan. Unfortunately I don\u2019t really keep up with that enough. If he did have hidden cameras I would\u2019ve been fired already for hiding in the rooms to use my phone and hit my vape lol.",

I would talk to the NY State Dept of Health Radiation Safety Division and see how they feel about someone requiring his employees to expose themselves involuntarily to unmonitored, unnecessary occupational radiation.  \n\nEven radiologic technologists, who voluntarily accept low-level radiation exposure as an unavoidable part of their job and are monitored to ensure the exposure stays at a level that's considered safe, can't be forced to expose themselves unnecessarily (as in assigning someone to hold babies under the useful beam to get a diagnostic-quality image) or in violation of ALARA (as low as reasonably achievable) exposure rates.  The exposure to the tech has to be minimized as much as possible with protective shielding and distributed throughout the staff as evenly as possible when it IS deemed necessary for adequate diagnosis of the patient's condition.  I worked in nuclear medicine for 25 years, was on the Radiation Safety Committee at 3 hospitals and did RN and ancillary staff radiation exposure education, so I think I know what I'm talking about. \n\nPlus look up the NYC statutes on tanning salons to make sure the place is following all the requirements for training of operators, direct supervision of employees designated to assist operators, permission from patrons, cleaning, testing of both beds and timers and required sign posting.  These machines need to be run in accordance with the law to minimize immediate bad outcomes like burns.  Too bad there's no way to minimize long-term bad outcomes like skin cancer.",

But fun little games you can play for short times or travelling I like are \n\nInto the breach (grid based mech vs kaiju strategy game)\n\nBloodroots (kill your way from A to B, but you get one shotted so you have to be quick and get a nice line.  Looks like samurai jack style)\n\nHuntdown (looks like a really good Super Nintendo game, I really like this one)\n\nTotally different games to Toad but same sort of kill a bit of time vibe\n\nEdit to add The Gardens Between. That is a decent puzzle game where you reverse and speed up time to solve puzzles. Well worth a grab on sale. It's not l9ng, but what you do get it really clever.",

Something that you can pick up for fifteen minutes and feel like you\u2019ve accomplished something.  \n\nFrom my experience, the Switch is HIGHLY LACKING in these types of games.  Unless you\u2019re wanting to venture into the dozens upon dozens of Roguelikes or Roguelites (which don\u2019t fit the chill part of the OP\u2019s wants), there are very very very few on the Switch.  \n\nThis is one of my bigger complaints about something like the Switch.  These kinds of short burst, casual games where something can be accomplished are mainly relegated to the mobile world and not the handheld world.  I\u2019ve looked and been disappointed several times.\n\nI know you can stop a switch game anywhere and out the console to sleep, but it\u2019s not the same.  Unfortunately OP, I don\u2019t have any recommendations for you other than the the one you mentioned in the original post is this thread (which is a great game).\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, the Switch has an amazing library of games\u2026 just only a very small few that fit into what the OP is looking for.",

I of course acknowledge the traditional owners of this land and I am lucky to be living in the country I am. I have always and will always show respect for peoples traditions and heritages, and of course acknowledge the disparities people have had historically with different backgrounds. This post is a simple \"Help me understand\", I am not whining or trying to be disrespectful to anyone.\n\nI (26M) and my partner (25F) have been in the hunt for a house for quite sometime, however, just like everyone else trying to enter the housing market it has been quite tough. My partner and I both have a university education and sit on a 170K combined gross income. We save around 40k-45k PA, I know it could be better, but we are extremely proud of that. We only have around 70k in savings. But, we are confident that we should have enough for a deposit in the next 12 months! Woohoo!\n\nI work with a guy who is the same age as me, in the almost the exact same position as me, in work and in life and has recently just bought his first property. We had a coffee a couple of days ago, trying to get some advice or lessons learnt from how he did it. He told me that he used a loan from the IBA. He is on a 2.64% interest rate, that increments by 0.25% every 12 months after the first 2 years until the variable rate is hit of 6.14%. He had also said his deposit was only $3,000. I did my research and he sure wasn't lying. The IBA also gives out start-up and business loans among other things.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* [IBA Deposit Requirements](https://iba.gov.au/home-ownership/iba-housing-loan-features/loan-deposits/)\n* [IBA Interest Rates](https://iba.gov.au/home-ownership/iba-housing-loan-features/loan-interest-rates/)\n\nI actually had no idea he was an indigenous Australian. I asked him about the application process and his exact words were \"My great pop or something was indigenous, so I just stated that and that was fine\". I get the identification process of who is an First Nation Australia and who isn't is quite complex. \n\nI get the purpose of the Agency to assist people who have been disadvantaged, But, in this case, I don't particularly think he has been at all when compared to others. Am I missing something? If I'm completely honest, I get the overwhelming feeling of unfairness, trying to give my family a home. It's hard for everyone at the moment. I apologies if this comes accross as disrespectful, but I would really like to be educated on this.",

                "So I\u2019m fairly centrist when it comes to this stuff but what I\u2019ve come to realise is that the indigenous community were prevented from many wealth creation options in the past that would heavily impact them today. \n\nIndigenous weren\u2019t allowed to apply for jobs, get bank accounts or live in certain areas. You could make a reasonable argument that unlike you and I this prevented their parents and grandparents from building substantial wealth or knowledge. \n\nThe alternative to all this is we give them reparations, I don\u2019t believe in that and don\u2019t think you could even decide on how to do it fairly. So how do we repay them for the equity that was essentially stolen from them? The best way is lower cost loans for housing, opportunities for them to start businesses on top of other programs that focus on equity. \n\nAfter a while we will be able to stop these schemes as modern indigenous aren\u2019t stopped from prospering today as they were in the past. We\u2019re  just living in a period where something does need to be done to right the wrongs.",

                "As a kid I saw my dad get cussed out regularly by racists at job interviews, among other places/events. My pop was separated from his mob, sad stories to tell. Not great for those coming back from wars either. We were often denied much of a future at all. Now we are in a position to take care of our families, this is good. Our disadvantages can be invisible to other people. But even if you have no direct connection to your heritage, even a grandfather having been restricted greatly impacts the family down the line. The impact of racism didn't end with the apology.\n\nOur community doesn't love being told who is Aboriginal or not, pretty big taboo. You don't get to choose. We accept who we accept, usually based on history/relationships, maybe knowing family or the local council or elders. We have a bit of a big tent philosophy. Understandable, given the history of Aboriginal blood. Some ones got to take care of people, lord knows there aren't many very dark skinned cousins left anyway. Our communities often show up to support workers, also.\n\nIt would be wise to direct your confusion at government and business deficiencies that have made basic life necessities so expensive instead.",
                "Taking your anecdote on face value, I'd say your colleague has taken advantage of a program aimed at helping generationally disadvantaged indigenous peoples. \n\nI would hope there was also some level of means testing for these programs, but can't speak to that without looking into it deeper. \n\nIn this situation it may seem unfair, as it appears to be someone getting a leg up they maybe don't need. But I'd hope the program overall makes a positive difference to people that need it most.",
                "Mate there\u2019s always going to be someone out there who gets thinks in what you might feel is an unfair way. \n\nThere\u2019s no point wasting mental energy feeling hard done by, that\u2019s just the way the world works. \n\nThere\u2019s heaps of people out there who would lie about tax deductions to save themselves some money. If you\u2019re gonna be upset by someone who is 1/64th aboriginal getting an IBA loan you should also be upset by people evading the tax man and a bunch of other things as well. But as I said there\u2019s no point comparing yourself to others",
                "It's not about fairness on an individual level, it's about [addressing systemic inequality](https://www.niaa.gov.au/sites/default/files/publications/niaa-closing-the-gap-annual-report-2022.pdf) that goes back for hundreds and hundreds of years.\n\nEverybody has a right to be frustrated and pissed off about how unfair current economic circumstances are, but programs that are trying to address deeply embedded systemic inequality for ATSI people are not really an appropriate (or 'fair') target for that, nor are they causing or really even contributing in any meaningful way to the broader issue.\n\nFor that, you need to look to broader economic policies that have driven the housing and employment markets to the state that they're in now, keeping wages low, profits high, and market forces/tax policy/development/zoning etc. etc.  [benefiting those who were able to buy properties in much 'fairer' economic conditions](https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2023/apr/13/young-australians-never-stood-a-chance-for-decades-the-controls-have-been-set-to-favour-older-generations).",

The whole point of IBA (which was your question) is to help address economic disadvantage that is a by-product of years and years of social disadvantage caused by harmful and oppressive policies. It\u2019s really not that hard to understand and best of all it really doesn\u2019t harm or bother you in any way. Your question about fairness assumes everyone starts at the same place and that isn\u2019t reality. If, given your current situation, you are feeling things are \u2018unfair for you\u2019 you probably, as others have suggested here, need to check your privilege.",

There is ZERO government handout for this person if they are white. Should there be a government handout for either the person described by OP or the person I describe?  I don't trust the government to make that value call with our money. \n\nYou have to remember that you pay more tax (preventing you from buying a house), so that you can fund a bloated government agency handing out these freebies to people",
                "It\u2019s pretty rich to extrapolate out the concept of fairness for indigenous Australians when you\u2019re in your mid 20s and not just doing fine, but excelling based on one anecdotal experience without all the info when as a group, indigenous Australians have the worst health outcomes and highest incarceration rates in the developed worlds. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s just me but that reeks of privilege.\n\nWill some people take advantage of a system when they don\u2019t need to? Yes. That\u2019s nothing new. It\u2019s the same as any welfare system since the dawn of time. The benefit of helping the truly disadvantaged is worth the trade off of the minority who use it unfairly.",

Yet reparations for the ancestors of these people is seldom discussed.",

                "> If I'm completely honest, I get the overwhelming feeling of unfairness, trying to give my family a home.\n\nI'm with you OP. I think it's ridiculous.\n\nI don't mind concessions based on a rational thought process. E.g. certain, high-earning occupations (doctors, lawyers etc) get a lower deposit requirement because they're seen as safe jobs.\n\nBut this concession doesn't seem fair to me at all. And it would come as a slap in the face to all those who are doing the right thing and saving up for property.\n\nImo property should be left to the market and the market alone. There should be no government-imposed concessions, deductions, nothing. No cap gains exemption for PPOR, no negative gearing, no first home owner grants, no land tax exemption for PPOR, no pension assets exemption for PPOR. Everyone pays rates and land tax and capital gains tax on selling.",
                "It's a fair question.\n\nUltimately, there are intergenerational issues that affect a significant number of first nations people.\n\n\nThere is also still substantial evidence to support some kind of cultural exclusion in some particularly well paying professions.\n\nTools like the IBA exist to smooth the curve for these statistics and improve access for disadvantaged people. In the broad spectrum it is positive, even if (as may be the case for your friend) maybe it benefits people that don't need it.\n\nThe philosophy is that it's better to help someone who doesn't need it, than to not help someone who does.\n\nIt would be tremendous if there were similar services for all disadvantaged groups, but we owe the biggest debt to first nations people and it's a meaningful step we can take towards reconciliation.",
                "It's not about fairness anymore unfortunately mate. That died with the rise of identity politics.

You just need to claim something and anyone who says otherwise is a bigot. \n\nAlso your acknowledgment at the top is frankly pathetic and reeks of pc culture. We as the current generation did nothing to the Indigenous population and do not actively oppress. There is nothing to acknowledge or apologise for. \n\nThose that came before did their thing, colonised, murdered, raped, and won. It was bad but it happened everywhere over our entire course of history. How far back and how many ancestral bloodlines should we acknowledge and apologise to/for. Are the borders of 200 years ago that were unfairly redrawn any less valid than those 2000 or 10000 years ago?\n\nThe evolutionary paradigm has won. We as a generation, largely do not perpetuate it, nor do we enforce it. If an aboriginal man or woman has equal merit to any other race they deserve equal opportunity. Which they have. If they need a helping equity hand, then survival of the fittest which has served humanity for the entirety of existence is wrong.\n\nThe time of reason should be purely merit based and not this pathetic apologist justice and equity drool.",

I was in hospital recently and the doctor (I'm 28 and she was same year as me, isn't that too young to be a dr anyway?) was a primary school friend. We recognised each other straight away but it took a while to work out the specifics. \n\nI ended up googling her and she'd won all these indigenous awards and scholarships. Which was weird because she was white and we were from a small country town with only one class each grade, we knew each other well. There was only one aboriginal the entire time in primary school, and he was my best mate, we'd established many times he was the only Aboriginal in our school. It was such a massive shock when I googled her, I was doubting my sanity but I guess maybe they found their connection later in life.",
                "Yep the law is racist.  If he was disadvantaged ok. If hes the same status as you why is he getting special treatment",
                "On the assumption that your question is genuinely raised in good faith (rather than an effort to trigger some nasty racist comments from people who don't have a good understanding of the difficulty of managing demographic imbalances), I'm going to address it in good faith.\n\nPrograms like the one you've described look at populations, not individual circumstances. When a defined population (in this case, Aboriginal people) has less ability to access something (ie - the housing market) than the whole population, then a program like this is aimed at addressing that imbalance.\n\nYes, it feels unfair at the individual level. But every individual has a different balance of advantages and disadvantages. For example, you said your mate was offered a starting rate of 2.64%. IBA loans start at 2.64% for people on an income below $128,856 - that's an income significantly lower than your stated $170k, so you're starting from a better financial position than your friend. Even if you were eligible for an IBA loan, you wouldn't be eligible for a starting rate of 2.64%, it would be 6.14%. Is it \"fair\" that someone who is in the same position as you life & work wise has a household income nearly $50k less than you? Maybe, maybe not - we don't know what the full circumstances are for either of you. \n\nIf it helps you to feel like life is more \"fair\", try investigating the programs and benefits you have access to - there are other programs aimed at other defined populations, which vary by state and which you might be able to benefit from. For example, First Home Buyer schemes attempt to address the imbalance in the ability of people who've never bought a home before to buy property compared to those who have a house to sell or borrow against. In South Australia, Homestart Finance has loans and services specifically offered to low-income earners or university/TAFE graduates. In Victoria, the Victorian Homebuyer Fund can reduce the deposit you need to come up with and save you having to pay Lender's Mortgage Insurance.",

It\u2019s a massive unaddressed injustice.\n\nSo this is not so much about disadvantage, moreso just what is due, all things fair and considered. \n\nEvery last Indigenous person in this country has significantly less wealth than they would otherwise if we\u2019d been through a just reconciliation process, so I don\u2019t see a problem here. In fact it\u2019s far less than is really due as a result.

                "There are two issues at play here.\n\nFirst, you have to understand that Indigenous Australians have started at a massive disadvantage in the current society that they have been made to live in. Their way of life was completely different to the British system that was dropped on them, so ofcourse they didn't have any of the skills, culture, or abilities to quickly integrate into this new society. When you add on all the systematic racism and the Stolen Generation that prevented them from even being able to integrate into society, you can understand why at this current point in time they are at a massive disadvantage to the rest of Australians.\n\nThe point of these programs is to try and reduce that disadvantage that they have. The idea is that over time, the disadvantage will decrease until they no longer require these programs and services.\n\nNow with any social program, there will always be people taking advantage and scamming the system. It's unfortunate but it's reality. It's the same with social welfare (e.g. Centrelink and \"Dole Bludgers\"). In the past, this sort of stuff used to infuriate me, until someone told me \"I'd rather 1 dole bludger scam the system if it means that 10 genuine people can get the help that they need.\"\n\nI guess thats the mindset you need to have. Yes, there are people that will abuse these programs. But understand that these programs are designed to help those who really need them.\n\nMy advice is to just focus on yourself. Comparison is the theif of joy. There will always be someone who is doing better than you and always someone who is doing worse. Don't dwell on it.\n\nTo be honest, at your age, you and your partner are doing well and you have a lot saved up. You are on the right track and 12 months is definitely a reasonable time line to get into the housing market. You have a beautiful baby who I'm sure has brought you much joy.",

This may result in some people qualifying who maybe don't really need it, and that is ok.\n\nUnfortunately in Australia we often adopt an attitude where the most important thing is making sure people are excluded from help unless they absolutely require it. We will even spend *more* money excluding people than it would cost to just make programs more accessible, because that scores more political points. Think current affairs articles about 'dole bludgers'.\n\nIn short, your colleague may not have absolutely needed this assistance, but many others do, for both historical and current reasons.

businesses will have the chance to open rent-free shops on Oxford Street in units vacated by illicit candy stores.\n\nWestminster City Council officials are trying to rid London's iconic shopping street of the tacky shops, which have replaced household names and blighted the area.\n\nNow, a new \u00a310million scheme aims to transform the area - branded a 'national embarrassment' by the boss of a top British retailer last week - by allowing small business owners to open stores rent free and lower business rates by 70 per cent.\n\nThe plan, called 'Meanwhile On: Oxford Street' will offer nine units to businesses trying to launch their first store, with some expected to open next month.\n\nThe scheme, which is intended to prevent candy shops opening, is also offering the new occupants marketing help, business support and a fit-out of the new stores.\n\nIt comes after reports that London's famous Trocadero complex in Piccadilly Circus is being turned into a giant mosque and Islamic centre for up to 390 worshippers.\n\nMeanwhile, the council is working with Trading Standards on an investigation into sweet shops amid allegations some have evaded \u00a38million worth of business rates.\n\nThe council has seized \u00a31million worth of illegal and counterfeit goods from candy stores and souvenir shops on Oxford Street since operations began in late 2021. \n\nMailOnline has led the charge to reclaim Oxford Street from nearly 30 American candy stores \u2013 and this website's reporting today attracted praise from the council.\n\nGeoff Barraclough, the council's cabinet member for planning and economic development, said: 'MailOnline's reporting has raised the profile the issue of dirty money highlighted by the US candy stores on Oxford Street. \n\n'The launch of Meanwhile On: Oxford Street will help future-proof the nation's high street by offering innovative local businesses as alternatives to low quality occupiers and candy stores.'\n\nIn one set of raids on the shops in March, the council worked with Trading Standards and the Metropolitan Police to target two shops and confiscated 7,000 items with a total value of \u00a3145,000.\n\nThese included 2,381 vape pens which had double the UK limit of nicotine and over 15 times over the legal tank size \u2013 which were originally hidden from officers to avoid detection but were recovered from five suitcases displayed on the shopfloor.\n\nOther seized goods included 1,723 counterfeit mobile phone cases, 1,602 unsafe charging leads, 372 power banks with no safety labelling or UK company details, 273 unsafe travel adapters and 182 counterfeit EarPods sold at different price points depending on who the customer was.\n\nNow, as the council tries to rebuild the look of the high street with its new scheme, officials are 'inviting applications from innovative, cutting-edge and up-and-coming brands who will offer something exciting and new' to the street.\n\nThey added that the businesses can 'use this high-profile space to bring their brand's story to life, for example through new technologies such as virtual or augmented reality'.\n\nOfficials also said the businesses could bring 'the production process to the customer by installing machines in store, opening visitor's eyes to how clothes and other materials are made'.\n\nThe campaign is aimed at businesses looking to launch their first store or physical space, with selected brands getting a prime store location for an initial six-month period.\n\n'We need the new Economic Crime Bill to help clamp down on these loopholes and to provide Government agencies such as Companies House and HMRC with the powers and funding they need. \n\nThese opportunities will be 100 per cent rent-free for brands, with a minimum reduction of business rates of 70 per cent.\n\nThe stores will either be available for single occupancy or as a themed concept store shared between multiple brands. \n\nCompanies will also get support in design, management and marketing from independent retail consultants Someday Studios.\n\nThe council said the scheme is expected to support around 35 brands over three years, with the first store opening in autumn 2023.\n\nMr Barraclough added: 'The West End has recovered quickly from the pandemic but there are still too many vacant units and poor-quality occupants.\n\n'That's why we've set up Meanwhile On: Oxford Street to help fill the gaps with upcoming brands showcasing their innovative new ideas.\n\n'I am excited to welcome new brands to one of the most famous streets in Europe, and support them with free rent, reduced business rates and help with promoting their businesses.'\n\nDee Corsi, chief executive of business group New West End Company, which is also involved in the project, said: 'The West End is internationally recognised as one of the world's most iconic retail and leisure destinations.\n\n'As a result, it has always been at the forefront for brands looking to engage with consumers in new and innovative ways \u2013 businesses that come here, do so to put their best foot forward.\n\n'The addition of pioneering brands, through the Meanwhile On programme, is just one of many indicators of the district's wider growth, and we look forward to welcoming the successful applicants to the area.'\n\nAnd James Watkins, head of policy at the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry, told MailOnline: 'Oxford Street is emblematic of London as a global city. \n\n'That is why, we strongly back this great initiative by Westminster City Council to ensure that the capital's premier shopping thoroughfare continues to flourish with innovative and forward-looking brands. \n\n'This would increase footfall and provide tourists from across the UK and around the world with the ultimate London shopping experience they are looking for. \n\n'During this cost-of-living crisis, it is critical that there are initiatives to help small businesses not just survive but thrive by providing rent-free facilities, reduced business rates plus mentoring support. \n\n'Businesses have taken a hammering during the Covid lockdown - this initiative will provide cutting-edge enterprises a platform to showcase their entrepreneurial ideas- not just to Londoners but to the world.'\n\nIn addition, a spokesman for Someday Studios told MailOnline: 'Westminster City Council have appointed Someday Studios to deliver the three-year project.\n\n'Someday Studios is a retail placemaking consultancy that helps landlords transform underused spaces into vibrant destinations that support local start-ups and creatives, and was founded earlier this year by Aoife Byrne and Becky Jones.'\n\nIt comes after Brian Duffy, the chief executive of leading British retailer Watches of Switzerland, last week branded Oxford Street a 'national embarrassment'.\n\nHe said there was 'no question that more needs to be done' to revive the area, adding: 'Oxford Street is a problem. I would almost describe it as a bit of a national embarrassment.\n\n'In terms of importance, it's probably the biggest victim of lockdown and what happened in retail, the demise of Arcadia group and department stores like Debenhams.'\n\nWatches of Switzerland owns a showroom on Oxford Street across the road from department store Selfridges. Mr Duffy said action should be taken to bring a 'higher standard' of businesses to the area.\n\nOn nearby Regent Street - which is owned by the Crown Estate - there has been 'more aggressive and successful landlord behaviour', he said.\n\nAlthough Oxford Street is still 'hugely popular', its range of stores is 'not optimising the status of the street and traffic', Mr Duffy added.\n\nTopshop's flagship store near Oxford Circus station closed in early 2021 after the demise of Sir Philip Green's Arcadia retail empire.",

                "So judge me how you will but here's my logic when it comes to tipping:\n\nI hate doing it. It's a symptom of capitalist greed because the only reason it's as big of a thing in this country is because food service businesses refuse to pay their servers and bussers minimum wage (as if that's even asking for a lot lol). But sadly, the reality is that our refusal to tip only hurts the servers, not the business owners and CEOs that we want to spite, so here's how I go about it.\n\nResteraunt servers automatically get 20%. The service has to be outright disrespectful for me to tip less because most of the time shitty food and service isn't the server's fault. Bitch about the restaurant on Google and move on.\n\nDelivery drivers get between $2-5 depending on the size of the order (I'm only feeding myself so it's never over one bag worth of stuff). The only exception is if im getting groceries delivered, that's when I tip higher.\n\nI'll tip small businesses and local businesses if I like their service/products and want to see them grow and succeed. I tip more if the business is queer, woman, and/or PoC owned because of intersectional solidarity and because those businesses have more potential to get unnecessary attention from bigots and i believe that if they run a good business they deserve support.\n\nAll other scenarios are up to whim and personal judgement. I never tip for charities at grocery stores because they don't actually use the money in good faith, corperations use it to pay themselves via tax write-offs. In places like Starbucks (which lol the nerve of those union busters to use class solidarity against their customers) and other large businesses that have tip screens, I ask the person at the counter if the tip goes to the staff or the restaurant, and if it goes to the restaurant I never tip because it never makes its way to the servers.\n\nWe can all acknowledge that tipping as it exists today sucks ass because a lot of businesses have been using it to take advantage of the growing class consciousness among average citizens and as an excuse to pay their workers less. But we can do that without screwing over service workers in the process. I understand everyone's frustration, but the anger should be directed towards businesses who refuse to pay their workers and not the workers themselves",

Once the construction is complete, we would create a token and market it to the public for purchase. The money collected from the token sales would be reinvested and used to build another property.\n3. Investors who purchase the token would own a share of the property and have the option to rent it out, sell the token through our website or mobile app marketplace, or use it as collateral to take out a loan from our partner bank.\n4. To attract investors, we would use a variety of marketing tactics such as social media, email marketing, content marketing, and public relations efforts.\n5. As we continue to acquire more properties, we could offer a variety of services to our tenants, such as property management, maintenance, and repairs, to create additional streams of revenue.\n\nWhat do you guys think?

I see some guys wearing dress shirts with ties but no jacket, dress shirts and slacks, while some others just wear anything with a collar.\n\nI've been able to get by with just a crewneck or mock/turtleneck sweater in colder months, and a polo shirt or aloha shirt in warmer months.  Because of this, it feels like I no longer need OCBDs.  But i keep one dress shirt on the few occasions where I need to look very dressed up.

                "Interesting topic that I think about regularly when I open my wardrobe.\n\nI'm a law firm lawyer. I have a big collection of suits. Pre pandemic I would suit up every day Mon to Thurs, mix of tie and tie less.\n\nI think in 2022 I wore a suit less than five times. The regularly worn items have been knitted polo shirts or tshirt (summer) or knitted sweater (in winter), with chinos or neutral colour jeans (not blue denim), and loafers or Common Projects. For \"proper\" meetings I would add a casual blazer, single or double breasted.\n\nThis stands me out in my workplace as being casual, but even then a tie is rarely worn by anyone, and what used to be Friday smart casual has become Monday to Friday workwear.\n\nSpeaking personally, the change has been a mix of:\n\n- Weather - where I am the weather has generally gotten hotter, and so there are less days I can wear a suit without sweating through it.\n- General relaxation of attitude towards \"corporate uniform\", consistent with changing attitude towards life - I'm still dressed respectably, and my counterparties, clients and friends are also dressing down. Also for a lot of the last few years, there were no more than 30-50% of people in office - so what does work clothes even matter in that context as long as you are dressed respectably?\n- Aligned with above - wanting to be more comfortable on a daily basis. \n- Wanting to try different fashion items - I like a good suit, but it can get boring after many years of wearing it daily.\n- Expenses - getting a good suit setup is usually a lot more expensive than a good work casual setup. \n- Some physical changes during the pandemic - mix of working out and eating better - meant that I needed new clothes anyway... And then see above point.\n\n\nI still like wearing a good suit... But regularly think about selling most of my suits when I open my wardrobe.",

My employees have to wear collared shirts and long pants, but these can be jeans, slacks, whatever they want. Needs to look presentable that's it but I also want them to feel comfortable.\n\nI personally like to dress up to an extent, as I feel I represent the company, but it's a thin line as many clients wear either whatever or these hideous company branded shirts. Most of the times I end up being the best dressed person in the room.\n\nMy daily outfits include:\n\n* Loafers, New Balances, Clark's Wallabees or Paraboots for footwear\n* Jeans, Slacks, Flannels or Chinos as pants.

In that case I'll like wear darker blue Jeans / Flannels and definetly loafers with solid colored socks (pretty much the Drake's look).

I throw these on if I want to, I basically never have to and 99% of the times, I'll be overdressed. I don't mind this, as I actively choose to wear a suit.

To me a good shirt and suit is as comfortable as jeans, more so if the jeans are heavyweight and raw. Good dress shoes are more comfortable than some of my tennis shoes. Ties don't choke me, suits don't constrict my arms. I post what I wear day to to, you can check my comments. I also buy most of my wardrobe on eBay so the cost of a sport coat is less than a pair of khakis from gap. I hesitate to even mention cost though because I see the sort of items that get praised on this sub, and people have zero issue paying out the ass for things like chore coats, fatigue pants and paraboots. \n\nBeyond that don't people go out? I'm not just talking about fancy dinners. Art galleries are mostly free, same with museums. Symphony, operas, musicals and plays all have low cost seating options. Aren't there times when you want to look good in a more formal sense?  If you have significant others, how do they feel about your style when you go out?\n\nI know all fashion and taste is personal, I'm just trying to figure out what changed culturally where it seems like dress clothes are to be avoided rather than enjoyed.

                "$5k - Tree trimming/removal.  Great margins.  My initial investment was paid for after a few jobs.\n\n***** Update *****\n\nBackground, I wanted a side gig last year that would provide enough income to purchase a sailboat, long time goal!  I have some background in rock climbing so I was familiar with climbing and heights.  I had no experience climbing trees and had never used a chain saw in my life or done tree work.\n\nI'll try to organize this...\n\nEquipment:\nStihl MS 311 (used on the ground although I did take it up in a few trees for big cuts)\nStihl MS 193 T (designed for one handed operation while up in the tree)\nPetal Advanced RAD kit - Used this for climbing up in the tree using SRT (single rope technique)\nClimbing harness, hardhat with visor, ear protection, climbing rope, anchor, lanyard, hand saw\n\nLegal/Regulatory:\nThis depends on your area.. Some of the cities in my area require you to register as an independent contractor.  Also, some cities require a permit to cut down a tree or trim a significant amount.  Contact the city offices where you plan to provide services to find out if you need to register and if permits are needed.  (Some people do not register or seek permits, just be prepared for any consequences if there are any and probably a good idea to know them ahead of time should you take that risk.)  Insurance... For the places that require you to register as a contractor, they likely will require that you show proof of liability insurance.  I never had insurance, I was very conservative with the jobs I took on, I wouldn't take on a job that I knew I couldn't do safely.\n\nPricing:\nBefore coming up with my method of providing quotes, I priced out competitors.  My first few jobs, I provided low quotes just to get the jobs and some experience.  Once I had a good grasp of how long a job would take me, I quoted using this formula:\n\n$50 per hour while working on the ground and $100 per hour while up in the tree.\n\n$50 travel time + ($50 x estimated ground hours) + ($100 x estimated climbing hours) = Quote\n\nMinimum $300\n\nMy focus was on tree removal only... Reason? I am not an arborist and did not portray myself as one.  It is my belief that only certified arborists should be doing trimming or else you could damage/kill the tree.  Even with only seeking out removal business, I had more business than I could handle.  I was only doing this in the evening outside of my day job and on the weekends.\n\nWas common to make $600-$1k on a weekend.\n\nI did not offer haul away services.  I either referred them to a biz that would haul it away or cut it to size for their trash service to pick it up.\n\nLong story short, it is dangerous work but very profitable in urban areas with enough business.  If you have more questions, feel free to ask.",

                "**Under 10K:** Anything service-oriented that can be started cheaply (at this end of the spectrum, you should strive to leverage your time/labor instead of your capital, focus on a service/task/chore that people find annoying and would rather pay someone else to take care of, even though they could do it themselves)\n\n**10K-50K:** Exactly the same as 10K, but now you can scale it out. Start hiring people, training them, maybe also invest in hiring a sales prospector on commission basis.\n\n**50K+:** Exactly the same as above, but now you can take a step back and manage it all. (at this end of the spectrum, you should strive to leverage your capital instead of your time/labor)\n\nThe beauty of this strategy is that no matter how much you start out with, you can test your concept on the market cheaply and quickly (getting your MVP out, in other words). Even with 50K in the bank, you can launch the idea as if you had only 1K, and grow/pivot accordingly. That 50K should never be thrown into the fray all-up straight from the get-go. At least, not until the concept has been proven in some way.\n\nHere are some free ideas, based on my last visit to my brother's university:\n\n1. Eco-friendly waste disposal/resale - college students are incredibly wasteful, they throw shit out after every semester/schoolyear. a lot of it is perfectly reuseable.\n2. Mobile mobile phone repair - that's not a typo. I mean an on-demand mobile phone repair service that can show up at the location of the customer and fix their broken phones/cracked screens/etc.\n3. Essay writing service - I did this in college myself. Realized that I was a prolific and efficient writer, so began charging people to write their term papers for them. Charge based on 3 criteria: how many pages, desired target grade, how much time until due. The last one is where you can really see your profits soar. College kids are lazy. A paper you'd typically charge $50 for, you can demand 200 or 300 if it's due the next day and they're panicking. I ended up making more money than the campus drug dealer.",

It was a local hotspot for young adults and seemed like an amazing place to spend time (I spent 3-4h there). Drinks were $10 each, hookahs were $35-50 each and unlimited coals (flavour lasted a good 2-3h), and it was amazing just sitting on a bed and lounging with my girlfriend in downtown Prague enjoying a hookah. There\u2019s far too many clubs in my local area (Calgary, Alberta), and nothing like this where you can just take your shoes off with your friends and relax for hours on end. I would love to see something like this in the city, and feel it would be popular due to the amount of vapers and smokers Calgary has. \n\nHappy investing everyone! ",

In the beginning I only had 5k to start with and sometimes I would end up with no money for 2 weeks for myself because of late payments but I always made sure my guys were well taken care of, also even if we finish early, our normal hours are 8 to 5, like at 1 I still pay them the day.

                "Still evolving, but even in my first year, I turned a big profit.  SKILLED landscaping and gardening.  \n\nI was a vegetable, herb, fruit and flower farmer for years.  Also know alot about native plants and always learning and being creative about design, in a way that benefits the ecology.  Point is, most landscapers don't know much beyond how to manicure lawns with machines and use the same old stale and uninspiring planting schemes.  Hardly anyone wants to eat produce and wlak through a garden propped up with harsh chemicals, especially those with kids.  Pandemic and stuck at home made people stare a good long while at their yards.  I offer the following which makes me get way more inquiries that I'm ready to handle and can charge better than I ever made as a small organic farmer....\n\n-Advanced knowledge combined with varied and practical experience.   Too many philosopher-gardeners permabro types that leave the average homeowner with a mess.  Save most of that experimentation for your own personal plot (I do and sometimes get new approaches and other times am humbled about my bullshit ideas).  So be a HIGH LEVEL GARDENER.  Especially because you will need employees to be more successful and not burnout and they will lean on you for support.  Very few people exist with this skillset.   15 years in, I am still learning about plants, land, and water all the time.\n\n-Excellent communication and general customer service.  BASIC STUFF!  Applies to any business.  The bar is so low in the trades world at least around here\n.  Many of my customers have explicitly said \"it makes the difference\" when I give a heads up about being late, which I keep to an absolute minimum.  Followup emails and essentially giving a shit.  People often only remember how you made them feel, so make them feel good about working with you in a genuine way.  Smile.  Be positive.  Don't be a downer.  Be honest if you can't help but offer leads.  Give options for saving money without compromising the goal.  Etc etc.  Put yourself I their shoes.  What experiences with a plumber or mechanic did you love and hate?\n\n-Be a leader, not a manager.  I still participate daily in the big lift.  Sure, it holds me back from growing, but I made a personal decision to never be the guy just pointing all day and not lifting more than my iPad.  Goal is to do LESS but I will never have someone do what I'm not willing to do.  And compensate well when deserved.  And respectfully part ways if not deserved. Either they move forward or away.  No one wants to make the same wage for years.  Sign them up for trainings,  etc.  You are a mentor.  People will be loyal and give a damn, rather than just doing bare minimum.  Think about the worst bosses you had and figure out how to be the opposite.  Easy to forget what it is like to be an employee when the money rolls in.  I remind myself regularly to share the wealth.  Give and the world will always give back.  Corny but my life experience and observing others has proven that to me over and over.  One of my biggest mentors is wealthy as anyone in my locale and commands tremendous respect.... and he is possibly the most generous person I've ever met.  Obviously being generous doesn't make you rich, but being a greedy dick makes all that money meaningless.\n\n-Love what you do.  I've had many hustles and have many more on the horizon.  The ones I did purely to make $$$ were the ones that never felt worth the stress.  Because anything you hustle for will be stressful and test you deeply, so when you're ready to bail, is there any passion for it that can make the difference?  That, and everything above, is just my experience.  I'm sure there are successful people running a business they don't have a passion for and that's just fine for them.  My buddy is doing well designing cardboard boxes lol but definitely has lots of other things he wants to spend his mental energy on after hours.\n\n-Collaborate with the right people.  That's a deep dive there....\n\n-Organized.  Lot of that already in other comments.\n\n-Charge what you are worth.  They know someone that can do it for less? So why did they call you?  Back to point 1, you offer something very few can.  An essential part of being successful in other comments.  Why do they want you instead of the next servicer?\n\n-Luck LOL.  \n\n-And don't give up.  Invest in those failures.  They are like teachers when you adjust your attitude.

                "I have a cabinet shop.  I've been doing it now for ten years.  I have had other businesses, but this is the longest one has been successful. Here are some things that might have led to it being a good business for me:\n\n1. I grew up in a restaurant family.  So was exposed to owning a business from a young age.\n2. I do have a masters degree in business.  My undergrad is in electrical engineering and I went back for business after I hated my first few jobs out of college.\n3. I kinda fell into a woodworking business.  I had just quit a job back in 2011 and wasn't sure what I wanted to do.  I had enough money saved to take a couple months off. During that break I made myself a few things using my parents old rusty tools.  I then discovered Etsy and thought maybe I could sell something.  I did.  Then I got involved with other local artisans who helped me find other ways to sell.  \n4. I only sold online for the first two years of my business.  I saw it was a very tough way to do it.  Online you are competing against so many other people. Some of those people may not care if they turn a profit.  Plus customers can't really tell how good your item is compared to others with pictures.  So I quickly found ways to sell locally. \n5. I have multiple streams of sales.  I do custom retail orders for locals.  I wholesale lots of stuff to stores throughout my state.  I sell lots of things to other businesses (B2B sales).  I do a few major trade shows and craft fairs and sell things at those. That way I am not reliant upon just one type of customer.\n6. I have invested 80% of what I made back into the business.  I bought a large commercial building for my workshop.  I have spent 250K on tools and equipment.  I spend lots of money on lumber, getting it when the price is good.  This has allowed me to increase production and pay little or no tax.  My business shows a couple grand in profit each year, because I have so many write offs.  The tax code is very business friendly and you should take advantage.  I was audited about seven years into it and passed with flying colors. \n7. I've alwasy viewed what I do as a business, not a hobby.  Can't get the two mixed up.\n8. I have a certain way of pricing things that I think is the best.  I price things at what I think the market will support.  So if I think a product will sell good at $100 then its $100.  I then figure out how to make that item at a cost that will be profitable to me.  \n9. I use the Japanese technique of Kaizen.    Roughly it means continuous improvement.  I'm always looking for the best way to make something.  Make it faster. Make it better. Make it cheaper.   \n10. The biggest thing is that I like what I do.  Its not like work.  I have fun.  I like being my own boss.  I will never retire from this job.  It gives my life purpose.   Plus I'm living a lot of guy's dream.  I have tools and machinery most only dream about.  \n11. I care about my business reputation.  I won't let people take advantage of me, but I do everything I can to make a customer happy.  Word of mouth advertising is valuable.  A customer has a problem with a piece of furniture I made?  Its their fault?  I still will fix it at my cost.  I want the reputation that I'm the best person to deal with in the state.",

            "selftext": "This is aimed at younger folks and those just getting started in entrepreneurship, particularly in tech.\n\nAll over TikTok and Reddit, people keep throwing around all this useless advice to \"become successful.\" Wake up earlier, read more books, etc. Courses about getting an \"entrepreneurs\" mindset. That you have to hustle and work hard. \n\nAll of that is bullshit. Those attributes will not make you successful. \n\nI mean don't get me wrong--it's good to organize your life. But speaking as someone who founded four successful online businesses and works in a VC firm, these trendy pieces of \"advice\" are all platitudes. \n\nThe best piece of actionable advice I can give, based on founding four successful businesses and working with other successful firms, is this: \n\n# 1). Pick and industry or niche, and master it. \n\nThis is a huge pre-requisite that's not emphasized enough. Identify the industry or niche you want to enter (as specifically as possible) and become a master in it. Learn everything you can. \n\nBuy products from your (future) competitors. Understand the pain points that consumers in this industry face. Do market research. Figure out which keyword combinations to target. Learn about the technical attributes.\n\nThe most successful businesses I've worked with all follow the same trend: They were formed by people who used to work in a specific industry as 9-5 employees, working for a company. They accumulated significant industry-specific knowledge, and understood pain points. Then they started their own business in this industry, targeting those pain points. \n\n# 2). Target an intersection of two industries or niches.\n\nWhat happens if you can't pick which industry or niche to enter? Or what if your selected industry is too competitive?\n\nDo this: list what you're good at, or what you're interested in. These can be as random as you'd like. Then, pinpoint a (viable) intersection between two listed interests or skills. \n\nFor example: let's say you can build websites relatively well. You're also interested in cars.\n\nAs we're all aware, the web design industry is \\*\\*extremely\\*\\* competitive. And what do cars have to do with web design? \n\nInstead of entering the web design field, enter the web design field targeting automotive dealers and mechanic shops. Build a few fake demo websites for auto mechanics, and then cold call auto mechanic shops with poor websites and offer them their services. Capture the vertical.\n\nTime and time again, I've seen this trend: \n\n* Person works for a corporation, in a specific industry. \n* Person accumulates knowledge about said industry. \n* Person leaves the company, and starts his own small business targeting a pain point that their former employer was unwilling to target.",

Everyone wants the secret sauce to either be or hire the person to invent the next sprocket. There is a model called Bloom\u2019s taxonomy of learning (shaped like a pyramid) which shows basic knowledge gathering/retention as the lowest state and creativity as the highest. So everyone thinks you can just chop off the top and run with it - unfortunately this leaves you with a very small pyramid. Like you said, building out the foundation as well as the subsequent steps will give you a more substantial result. \n\nThe other variable is that the system - any societal system has never been fair. Geniuses whose insights have turned the corner on humanity die penniless and unknown while snake oil salesmen make money hand over fist. The diet industry is about 71 billion dollars and most of it is demonstrably false.  \n\nIdeally you have a great idea, connect it to the market, and it takes off. But great ideas fall through the cracks or are undervalued and well marketed junk can rise to the top. I think there is some value in acknowledging this phenomenon exists but also agree that many of these books are just selling the idea that you can game/outsmart or outwork the system which often requires resources that are beyond a regular person\u2019s means.",

Has the kind of people you want to work with. If you want to stay away from criminals, do not become a criminal lawyer.\n1. Requires doing the kind of things that you are comfortable doing. If you cannot see blood without fainting, do not become a surgeon.\n1. Has people willing to pay someone for what you are planning to do. Do not try to make a career out of your donut-eating skills.\n1. If people are willing to pay someone for what you want to do, make sure to be that someone, i.e. at least look competitive.\n\nThe previous points are just to get a job. If you want to try entrepreneurship then:\n\n1. Find a niche or industry where people and companies are willing to outsource the job, rather than keeping their own teams in-house for it. Consider this in the context of the people you want to work with too.\n1. Find a way to show that you are the best option for them. You want them to find you, and you want them to prefer you over any other potential competitors they may find too. There are 4 main ways to do this, depending on the 4 stages a market may be: functionality or features, reliability, convenience, and cost. Unaddressed pain points may be found in any of the 4 stages, being more likely in the early stages, and only cost in the last stage.\n\nYou may find that the previous points need further clarification and detail. If you want enough level of detail, you may need to read a book for each point. After you have done that, you may have additional questions, leading to additional books.

idea junkie and constantly seeking out new, trending, and novel businesses to be inspired, excited about, and motivated from.\n\nSo I'll share some of my favourite places / ways to discover them and would love to know where are your favourite sources to discover new business ideas / proven businesses?\n\n**8 of my favourites ways to find profitable business ideas...**\n\n**1/8) Websites, Newsletters, Blogs & Podcasts That Reveal Business & Side Hustle Ideas**\n\nThese are like \"business idea p0rn\" to a business idea junkie like me personally as they reveal proven profitable business ideas, niches, side hustles etc and often with data and proof too.\n\nAnd sometimes the founders full success story which can be inspiring and motivation.\n\nSome of the best include:\n\n*

\n\n**2/8) Affiliate Networks:**\n\nMost of the major affiliate networks from Amazon, Commission Junction, AWIN, Impact Radius, ShareASale, LinkShare etc provide data on their best converting affiliate offers / merchants.\n\nAnd if I start seeing patterns among what type of business they are in or products they sell I'm usually convinced this must be a profitable business type.\n\nThere are also some tools to find profitable affiliate programs that I use:\n\n* [https://affilisting.com/](https://affilisting.com/)\n* [https://www.affiliatecorner.co/](https://www.affiliatecorner.co/)\n* [https://affiliatebag.com/](https://affiliatebag.com/)\n\n**3/8) Ad Networks:**\n\nThe bigger Display Ad Networks like Mediavine and AdThrive (now Raptive) require substantial traffic levels of 50,000-75,000 visitors p/m for sites to be accepted and to display their Ads on site.\n\nSo it's not hard to imagine most sites on these networks are making some decent money.\n\nAnd both require all sites on their network to have a word for word disclaimer displayed on the site to tell their audience they are displaying Ads from this network.\n\nSo a quick search for that disclaimer brings up literally endless sites monetizing using these networks.\n\nIf you want to automate it two great tools for both finding websites monetized with Display Ads or specific affiliate networks are:\n\n* [https://nichesitemetrics.com/](https://nichesitemetrics.com/)\n* [https://www.nichefinder.io/](https://www.nichefinder.io/)\n\n**4/8) Browing Digital Product Market Places:**\n\nMarketplaces like AppSumo, GumRoad, Clickbank, Udemy and more all sell digital products like tools, courses, software, templates etc.\n\nAnd most will show you how many sales / students / downloads they have.#If I'm seeing 1000's of sales / customers / downloads especially across multiple vendors with similar products then that looks like a profitable product type / business to me.\n\n**5/8) Social Media Trends:**\n\nMost of the major social networks have a \"trending\" section from Twitter to Insta to Youtube, to TikTok to Pinterest and looking at which topics and products are being mentioned consistently can help finding products / businesses which are trending right now or that are consistently popular.\n\nTikTok, Insta, and Pinterest have the best trending sections IMO as those are more product orientated and have influencers promoting brands etc.\n\n* Tik Tok Browse is here: [https://www.tiktok.com/browse](https://www.tiktok.com/browse)\n* Tik Tok Creator Centre here:

Theive, eComHunt, EtsyHunt etc show new, trending, and popular eCommerce products across all the major platforms from Amazon to Shopfy to Etsy.\n\nAnd soon as you start seeing common trends / products

practically get all the most useful data from them on revenue, profit, business model, income souces, traffic, URL and more.\n\nIt eliminates the guesswork and just tells you THIS business is profitable. I look for multiple listings over time for businesses on this topic / model and I know I've found a good idea.\n\nA few brokers and marketplaces include...\n\n* Flippa\n* Motion Invest\n* Empire Flippers\n* FE International\n* BlogsForSale\n* Aquire\n* Investors Club\n\n**8/8) Niche Finder Tools**\n\nThese are tools / searchable databases that you can use to either find profitable \"niches\" or websites in specific niches that have 'X' levels of traffic or make an estimated $X p/m (usually it's a guestimate based on traffic levels and their monetization method).\n\nUsing this data you can either look for trends in topic / niche to see lots of popular sites around 'X' topic and presume it's probably a profitable business topic.\n\nOr even pinpoint sites in specific niches that appear to make a lot of money despite low levels of traffic - showcasing a good opportunity to delve into that business model / niche.\n\nSome of the ones I know and use include...\n\n* [https://nichesitegrowth.gumroad.com/l/curatedniches](https://nichesitegrowth.gumroad.com/l/curatedniches)\n* [https://nichesitemetrics.com/](https://nichesitemetrics.com/)\n* [https://www.nichefinder.io/](https://www.nichefinder.io/)\n\n***Those are some of the places a business idea junkie like me gets his fix but what about you...***\n\n***...where do you find out about new or profitable business ideas?***",

Was passed over several times for raises and promos. Left that job and started a small business with a partner.\n\nDid that for several years before deciding to go back to working for an established company. However, had not been doing tech work for 4 years, so no one even gave me an interview after over 100 applies.\n\nEventually got a referral from am old coworker (project Mgr) for a role in his team. Didn't get that job but got a call for an interview at the same company as a BA.\n\nLiterally 0 idea what a BA did, I googled it and BS'd my way through the first interview. Got a call back for an on site, spent the time between them learning how to be a BA using blogs and such. Somehow did well in the interview and got the job.\n\nBeen doing it for 5 years now, and it's an amazing fit for my skills, and I'm now a lead.",
                "Covid came and I was doing door to door marketing at the time. I left my job and collected unemployment while watching my 7 mo old daughter and used that time and money to try different tech courses. I used options trading to eventually fund a BA bootcamp and my CSM, then spent over a year just bombing interviews before a job finally gave me a chance last June. I was able to get my ECBA cert recently, and a lot of good experience on various projects for different clients but due to a lack of experience, lack of a degree and me being remote, it was hard for them to put me on a new project so I was sadly let go last month. I felt pretty defeated but the opportunity also gave me a lot of confidence that I can do anything as long as I put the work in. I'm sure something better is on the way soon",

I chose my Information Systems degree specifically to become a BA.\n\nMy first job had a BA title but was more of a report developer role (but gathering my own requirements and conducting UAT as well).\n\nThe D&A team grew from 2 to 9 and I carved out a role as a real BA for reporting and data engineering teams.\n\nWhen our project manager left, I filled that opening but also transitioned the data engineering team to agile. So now I'm mostly in the PO role, looking to become a Product Manager in the near future.",

He takes that back to the Controller, and I was suddenly the Shop Floor liason for training people how to use this new system.\n\nFast forward a few years and I get tagged to be part of an implementation project; this time a new ERP AND various modules for each department.\n\n2 years ago I got an official \"BA\" job at a different company.",

The company wanted to keep me so they offered me a BA role despite me having zero experience. However, I did have a resume full of previous analyst roles that I believe gave me an edge and an unrelated social sciences degree.

I finished all my work pretty early, but we took a bus to get out there so we were kind of captive... So I usually had 3-4 hours of free time. I saw that one area was entering all this info manually into a spreadsheet, then we would take that spreadsheet and enter it into another system manually... So I learned backend VBA in my spare time. I saved 2 more hours a day, and figured out how to speed things up for the upstream team too. I thought maybe I should be a dev. \n\nSo I went to a technical college for a dev program. That year it merged with some other programs, and they created an IIBA certified BA stream. I realized that was what I wanted to do, but I still took all but one course from the full dev stream as well. I was hired as a BA before I even graduated. I finished the program and started work a week later. Been doing that for 12 years (in two days).",

I did projects where I did BA work and looked up the skills BAs used to be competitive. I did an internship at a fortune 100 as a cloud consultant. Figured out I hate corporate and didn't want a consultant life. Before I graduated, I applied to many small to mid sized companies. I really had no hope that I was going to get a BA job out of college but I was lucky! It's a small company but the people are nice and the pay is good and they care about work/life balance. My boss is the sweetest soul. I especially like that it's fully remote. Very grateful.",

My wife worked at a casino & they had a career fair, so I went. I was looking for PT but the recruiter got to know my situation & introduced me to the financial manager. He offered me a job in the scheduling department because we talked about my background & skills.

So she basically helped me get an interview that was for a business analyst position. Didn\u2019t think I would get it at all, but I did get the job. My job is mostly manual testing (we have another team for automation) but I also help our PO with defining acceptance criteria and designing our features.

I handmade jewellery and sell  on platforms such as Etsy or amazon and make more than I ever did in my corporate job). \n\nHer answer shocked me. \u201cSo you\u2019re on benefits then.\u201d\nMy mouth dropped and I said that no, I run my own business.\nShe said she knows my type and I\u2019m just lying to not look bad (upper middle class neighbourhood). \nI told her to mind her own fucking business. She called me a scrounger and asshole without manners. I removed myself from the situation.\n\nWhen I was leaving with my daughter, I heard one of the other mums telling her that I\u2019m really successful. I wished I turned around to see her face.\n\nNow, I\u2019m thinking  about this and I feel bad. It wasn\u2019t my proudest moment and I feel that I\u2019ve made school runs awkward for ny husband now. AITA? Because if so, I\u2019ll have to apologise",

The footage was captured over the course of several meetings in New York by one of OMG News\u2019 rockstar undercover journalists.   BlackRock Inc is the world\u2019s largest asset management company that\u2019s gained more notoriety as of late due to its large acquisitions. Varlay says it's easier for BlackRock to do things when \u201cpeople aren\u2019t thinking about it\u201d and the asset giant \u201cdoesn\u2019t want to be anywhere on the radar. This story is a peek into why.\n\nEDIT 5: We are climbing on \"All\". Keep pushing for exposure!\n\nEDIT 4: The Mods have banned me from this sub for \"not being nice\". I THINK the violation resulted from me referring to a demeaning commenter as an \"NPC\".\n\nEDIT 3: Mods have rightfully warned that if we can't be nice in the comments they will lock them.\nMods have also referred to the source as \"dubious at best\" and states that they would leave the post up \"for now\".

There are probably people on your floor pressing the down button so the elevator is going to have to stop again on the way down. \n\nIf one person on each floor uses your \"Life Pro Tip\" the elevator is going to have to make twice as many stops for each round trip, dramatically slowing down the experience for everyone.",

A line of 3 wheelchairs was already there when we arrived and they were complaining that they had been waiting forever.

                "Here are a few key points about this LPT:\n\n- It works because most people in a busy building at rush hour will be trying to go down to leave work. Pressing the up button means you're less likely to find a full elevator.\n\n- By going up a few floors first, you essentially skip ahead of all the people waiting below you to go down. Then you can ride down empty or with fewer people.\n\n- This is most effective on middle floors, as going up or down from the top/bottom floors still leaves you having to go against the dominant rush hour traffic direction.\n\n- It may only save a few minutes each time, but over months or years of daily commute, those minutes do add up meaningfully. Even 5-10 minutes saved per day translates to 2.5-5 hours per year.\n\n- The key is to only go up a few floors, not all the way to the top, so you're still riding in the predominant downward direction traffic. Going too high defeats the purpose.\n\nSo in summary, this LPT takes advantage of crowd dynamics during busy rush hours to bypass congested downward traffic. A minor time-saving tactic but a useful one for busy office buildings at commuting times.",
                "This doesn\u2019t make any sense. If it\u2019s so busy going down every time, it would be equally busy when you\u2019re in it going down after you do this strategy",
                "I used to work in a building with 'smart' elevators. If the elevator was at maximum load it wouldn't stop at any more floors until someone got out. I worked on the the top floor and at lunch-times and leaving times, a couple of us would get in and jump up and down a bit to fool the elevator into thinking that it was full and it would take us all the way down without stopping at any other floor.",
                "I'd have to assume this is specific to whatever algorithm is in place in that system.  Unless there is a universal solution that all elevator makers employ.  But I doubt it.  Too many variables and different systems would probably work better in different circumstance.",
                "sometimes 2 elevators arrive at once, and i'm the only one in the second one (or one other passenger). I wait for the other one to close doors and a few seconds later i close mine. Both are going down but mine has less frequent stops.",

This community is really awesome at helping with advice, and perhaps this can be another case of support\r  \n\r  \nTrigger Warning: >!slander, online harassment, racial accusations!<\n\n**July 9th, 2023**: [Someone in my(m22) friend group congratulated my girlfriend(f23) on starting a business, and it led to a huge argument](https://www.reddit.com/user/throwralivingone/comments/14vadg9/someone_in_mym22_friend_group_congratulated_my/)\n\nMy girlfriend (Jane) recently started a side business of being a baker after graduating college, and she bakes out of her home. She took some commissions during college, but didn't have the time to fully commit to it, so she only did it on the side during college. It's not her main job now, but she hopes it can be someday. It's where her passion is, and her mother used to bake a lot too, thus how she learned. She mostly does cupcakes and cookies by word of mouth, and a lot of people used to reach out to her personal Instagram to ask about orders. She recently created a new Instagram specifically for orders and posting photos of her pastries, and that's her business Instagram now. However, it lead to an argument within our friend group that has caused distance between some, and that's why I'm posting today. We were friends in high school, but we started dating about 4 months ago for context\r  \n\r  \nKrystal is the friend she had an argument with, and she is very politically active. She is more so Jane's friend from college, and Jane invited her into our friend group. She also introduced me to Krystal who she met in one of her classes. Krystal has a second Instagram account that promotes/reposts inspiring stories, and she often gives a written commentary on each post she shares. When Jane opened her business and made her baking Instagram, Krystal screenshotted the page and made a post telling people to congratulate her friend who started a \"black-owned business\" along with how she was proud of her , and she left a link to Jane's page. However, Jane had an issue with it, and she saw the post and reacted to it before I learned about it when we were with our friend group at a bbq on Friday\r  \n\r  \nA few of us were sitting at a table when Jane confronted Krystal in front of everyone, and she said she wanted Krystal to remove the post. When Krystal asked why, she said she didn't ask permission to do a shout-out, but she didn't stop there. She said she didn't appreciate being congratulated for starting a black-owned business because being black \"had nothing to do with it\", and she said it was \"disrespectful to the skills she learned\". She also said it was disrespectful to her parents because she was mixed; her mom is black and hispanic and her dad is white. But when Krystal said that she thought it was inspiring, she said that the shoutout was \"unearned\" because she didn't want to be inspiring or \"make everything about race\", and this was when I told her that it wasn't the right place for the conversation because Jane was getting really upset, but she told me to shut up and that it had \"nothing to do with me\"\r  \n\r  \nBut when Krystal asked why she was getting upset, she said it was because BLM was an \"easy way to get likes\" for her Instagram and that it \"wasn't genuine\". She even joked that she could choose to buy a black car instead of a white one, and she would \"spin it into something political\". Krystal apologized and said she'd take it down, but someone else (Jon) sitting there said Jane was being ridiculous and called her \"not black\". I immediately told Jon that that was out of bounds, but Jane snapped at me again and said she was didn't need me to stand up for her. Jane then told Jon that Krystal never asked for her consent, but Krystal left the table as Jon told Jane that she was being ungrateful and should've just accepted the shoutout. Jane then said she wasn't there to argue with Jon and went to look for Krystal. But when I followed and told her that we should just leave, she decided to go to the car and leave because she didn't want to go back outside to where Jon was\r  \n\r  \nThere is more to the argument that involved other people, but for the sake of time and this already being long, I'll just include the main people in Krystal and Jon. When we were driving home, I asked Jane why she didn't talk to me about the post before the party (I learned about it for the first time at the party), but she said it didn't concern me because Krystal was her friend. When I said that the bbq wasn't the right place to address it in front of everyone, she said the post was on her mind since it was posted a few days ago, and the bbq was the next time she would've seen Krystal. But when I asked why she didn't call her instead instead of doing it in front of everyone, she said she didn't think of that, but wanted to do face to face\r  \n\r  \nWhen I told her that I felt dismissed by how she snapped at me twice, she said she was sorry but that she didn't want me to defend her. Krystal took down the post on the same Friday night. However, Jon went on social media on Saturday and ranted about Jane didn't think she was black, and she engaged him in the comments last night which led to me making this post. When I called her yesterday to talk about Jon, she didn't want to talk about the rant and reminded me not to try and defend her, so I didn't press her. Honestly, I've kinda felt dismissed over the weekend, and she's never really dismissed me in all the years we've been friends. Granted, we only started dating 4ish months ago, but it still hurts\r  \n\r  \nWhen I asked if we could talk about how I felt dismissed yesterday, she said we could when she cooled down, but that she didn't want to do it immediately. She wants me to stay out of it, and it honestly hurts. I should've added this earlier, but I am Chinese for context. For more context, Jane is also supportive of blm like Krystal, and we have both been to a few events together. We have also gone to pride walks with friends and blm walks during 2020 especially, but she doesn't want me to have any say at all in this matter. I want to ask what would be the best way to go about this as she doesn't want to talk until she's cooled down, and I also want to ask if this is cause to be concerned and how to help her through what happening with Jon and everything. Sorry for this being so long, but there were a lot of angles and context needed\n\n[Update Post](https://www.reddit.com/user/throwralivingone/comments/14vadg9/someone_in_mym22_friend_group_congratulated_my/): **(July 16th, 2023)**\n\nBefore I get to my update, I want to say I'm grateful to the commentor in my first post who said that I was overreacting by telling Jane that I was hurt by how she told me to shut up despite her apologizing. I just felt the urge to try and defend her when Jon said everything that he did, and the commentor said that Jane was more than capable of defending herself and to not personalize it to much and focus on supporting her instead, and that made my first post worth it already to have learned that. I also apologized to Jane for overstepping my boundaries, and she apologized to me again for telling me to shut up even though I told her that she didn't have to. I told her that I would let her handle it and that I didn't want to make it seem like she couldn't defend herself, but she said she would value my advice because we were in it together, and she apologized for excluding me too. I'm writing again because Jon has continued to go after her along with a few others, and I want to ask for advice on how to best support her. Lastly before the update, the most that Jane responded to Jon on Facebook was telling him to stop talking about her in a single reply; nothing more, nothing less. Jon continued to rant in reply to her response, but she didn't respond anymore\r  \n\r  \nKrystal replied to Jon in the comments (of his original post) and told him that the situation had nothing to do with him. She also told him that she was wrong to shoutout Jane without her consent and apologized to her following the party and that she wanted to apologize publicly too. Krystal also made a post on her Instagram apologizing for the shoutout too after deleting it. She also called Jane and told her she felt terrible for everything Jon was doing that she said was her fault, and she said she hoped it didn't ruin the friendship. Jane told me that she was a little surprised with her second apology, but she accepted it and both agreed that Jon was way overboard. Jane also apologized for going overboard in what she said to Krystal in front of everyone and admitted that Jon's involvement made her more upset that she wrongfully took out on her, more on that later\r  \n\r  \nSimilarly to Krystal, Jon is very politically active on his socials, and he is also black for context to the situation as is Krystal. Jon made an Instagram reel about Jane and stated that she \"wasn't proud of her heritage\". He also stated that she \"shouldn't have gone into business as a black woman if she didn't intend to be a role model to young girls\" and that he was going to \"make sure people didn't support her business\" which really surprised us by how personal he's taking it. He even had the nerve to tag Jane's personal and business Instagram, and Jane has received some vulgar DMs as a result along with comments on some of her pastries. He also stated that she tried to throw something at him when he suggested being a role-model at the party, something that never happened because nobody became violent. He also said that he didn't report her to the police \"because black people have to build each other up\" and he \"wants Jane to learn from the situation\" because \"she has a responsibility to be a role model whether she likes it or not\". He also wrote that Jane once told him that she wasn't black which is another lie. He also shared his video on Twitter and Facebook while tagging Jane's pages in both, and the majority of our friend group have called him out in the comments, but that hasn't stopped him\r  \n\r  \nHe's continued to post about her on numerous days following the incident, and our friend group decided to cut him out as a result. We met a few days after everything Jon posted, and Jane and Krystal apologized to the group for having their argument at the host's party and ruining the event, but they were really accepting of it. Some also said that Jon had a habit of going overboard with his opinions, but that they overlooked it to not rock the boat on many occasions, something they regret and some apologized for too. We talked about how Jon said he's trying to ruin Jane's business, and they told us that they're commenting in his videos and will continue to do so although he blocked some of them on his socials already, so they began thinking of ideas of how to help Jane's business be protected from him\r  \n\r  \nThe last thing I'll say is this. In regards to why Jane exploded at Krystal at the party, she said it was because Jon reposted the shoutout that Krystal made, and she thought that he was involved with it too. She also said she was upset because Jon had a history with her that I didn't know about, and she told me about it. Jon once DM'd her about how she made pride/trans themed cupcakes for June, but didn't do anything for Black History Month. Jane actually thanked him for the suggestion and said she would do it along with other potential suggestions, but he called her out for \"not thinking of it herself\" along with \"thinking she's better than other blacks\". Jane apologized to me for internalizing it and said she wanted to work through things together going forward, and hopefully we can become stronger because of it. But a lot of what she yelled at Krystal about was actually meant for Jon (because she thought he was involved in Krystal's post), and she admitted she was wrong and apologized to Krystal about it too, and she also shared that bit with our friend group when we met to discuss Jon. I'm open to any suggestions on how to deal with Jon as he's continued to post about her after his initial videos, and I really want to thank anyone who replies\r  \n\r  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\r  \n\r  \nAdditional Comments\r  \n\r  \n(Phalangebanshee)\r  \n\r  \n\"I mean it would have been a lot more mature for your girlfriend to pull her friend aside and talk about it with her friend in private instead of confronting her in front of her entire friend group. I understand why she\u2019s upset and she has every right to be, she could have handled it a little bit better though.\r  \n\rIt\u2019s understandable you\u2019re hurt at being shut down and snapped at when you have nothing but good intentions, while your girlfriend is allowed to be upset at her friend, this situation could have been avoided if she just pulled her friend aside and talked in private if she didn\u2019t want anyone else to butt in her conversation. I don\u2019t think you should feel upset about her wanting to stand up for herself though, because it seems she handles herself well in confrontational situations. She was probably heated and didn\u2019t want anyone to speak for her, which is completely understandable. Definitely address how she spoke to you and how it made you feel, but try not to read too deeply into it. It sounds like her friend trampled over some of her personal boundaries so she is probably defensive right now, the best thing to do is to just listen to her and respect what she tells you",

And then it wasn't even Krystals fault in the end. I'm way too grown for this bullshit. Don't start shit in public if you don't want others to speak up. Jane was being a nuisance and if I was throwing a party and someone like Jane decided to make a minor issue with Krystal public, she wouldn't have been allowed over ever again as I don't invite drama into my life.\n\nI've never met any wholesome and good people who start drama in public and then whine when the people they started drama in front of have something to say about it. I'm not making any excuses about Jon as he seems like a real POS, but anyone who starts drama in my house that could've been solved by a simple private conversation would've been drop kicked out of my house.

But they want those women to claim to be just black so they can still claim to be pro-black but have their desired aesthetic in their partners so as to not seem hypocritical.

                "Do you want ethical advice or unethical advice?\n\n**Ethical**: Jon is clearly an asshole, but he's not doing anything illegal. The only thing you can do in response is just to keep having your friends respond to these posts he makes so they can refute the contents. Unfortunately \"this guy is lying\" isn't quite the same level of attention-grabbing that \"this woman is a self-hating racist\" is, so it's unlikely the corrections will receive as much attention as the accusations. Like they say, a lie can get halfway across the world before the truth can get its boots on.\n\n**Unethical**: You know what moves faster than a lie? A more salacious lie. Have everybody post that Jon is harassing Jane because he's obsessed with her, has been begging her to date him for years (and if he has a girlfriend then he offered to cheat on her), won't leave her alone, got really angry the most recent time he was rejected, and has been especially bitter since she started dating you. Also he made some racist anti-Asian comments about you when he found out you two were dating, why not? Don't make any specific allegations of anything too negative or illegal because you don't want to give him grounds to make a libel complaint or something, just make him sound like a pathetic stalker via vague innuendos. The absurd ferocity of his response just lends credence to the accusation; who assembles an angry slideshow and powerpoint presentation on half a dozen social media platforms about someone they casually know? Frankly I suspect there's a nonzero chance this is borderline true and he is attracted to her and throwing a tantrum, but for our purposes it doesn't matter if it's actually accurate. It'll spin his behavior into an embarrassing light and take the heat off of Jane and on to him. \"This woman is a self-hating racist\" is less interesting gossip to spread than \"this woman has an unhinged pathetic stalker following her everywhere.\" He who lives by the social media lynch mob dies by the social media lynch mob.",

He also stated that she \"shouldn't have gone into business as a black woman if she didn't intend to be a role model to young girls\" and that he was going to \"make sure people didn't support her business\" which really surprised us by how personal he's taking it.\n\nIt can be just *exhausting* when someone needs to make every thing that happens about their politics.

I understand not wanting your business and race to be used on a political page for likes but Jane handled this horribly. Is she that mad if she waited until the next time they saw each other rather than calling and setting up a time to meet? Why embarrass a friend over something that could\u2019ve been handled over the phone? I\u2019m also going to guess that Jon has a crush on Jane and her refusal to identify as black as well as dating an Asian man is causing him to act out. Sadly, this is where I say ESH.

Yes, BLM exists. Yes, there are still glaring and obvious underlying issues regarding race in the US. However, ffs, Jane is just....running a business, for herself, for her own merit. Race, sex and heritage has nothing to do with her success and her passion - her talent, skill and business acumen does. I will not speak nor do I claim to speak for anyone here, but I think I would be correct by saying that nobody likes when their personal achievements are boiled down to an insincere pat on the back that ties their success with their race, because it is condescending, at best, and judgemental at worst. Jon, with his gatekeeping, doesn't realize how he himself is being racist at this point - he equated all her success with her skin color, and not her merit, talent and business acumen.\n\n\n\nI mean, that is the *goal* of racial equality - where not only can you have equal opportunity for success regardless of your gender, sex and race, but where those aren't even factors in your success - where not only you can be a successful businessman *regardless* of your gender, sex and race - but where it is not even a factor. Where a successful person of color is not a soceital milestone, but a fact of everyday life.\n\n\nI mean, I cannot really blame Jon. He is a black man in America, and I cannot imagine the mental anguish when you live in a post-Civil Rights era where, even if, just on surface, POC have equal voting rights and civil rights- the prejudices, the smaller window for a soceital and financial climb, and the very real feeling of your own, personal success is still reduced to the color of your skin (like Jane's own feelings), but to turn around and reinforce those factors, equating your race to your core part of personal identity, and then gatekeepong other people of your race to your stringent set of ideals...is also unhealthy.",

BLM and having a Black-owned business have absolutely nothing to do eith each other and being upset that people wanting to support people in their community is the weirdest possible way she cluld have went about this. I don't understand the point of being friends with someone if you're mad they supported you and you tell tuen they didn't have permission to do so.\n\nKrystal's only bit of weirdness is apologizing to Jane because she literally had nothing to apologize for. She should probably distance herself from Jane, tbh. She had every opportunity to speak with her before and decided to try to humiliate her in a public place with their other friends. She also shouldn't have said that this didn't have anything to do with Jon because, as it later turns out, Jane did all of thisnto her because she wanted to confront Jon by proxy. The best thing for Krystal to do is find new friends.\n\nJon could have honestly just deaded all of this after his post about her issues with her blackness because she brought it up.

This all could've been solved had she privately spoke to Krystal about her Instagram post, but she allowed her anger to override common sense.\n\nOOP was also right to defend Jane from Jon.

I say that smells too much like raising generations of women to believe their manners are more vital than their safety.

I understand OOP wanting to fix the situation, but Jane seems hurt and is lashing out. She may even know the way she handled this was wrong but needs time to be able to admit that. If Jane's mom was half latio and half black, Jane may feel really awkward taking that \"black owned\" label and the accolades that come with that, especially if she identifies stronger with her white or latino heritages, maybe even more so if her mom was less than half black. Some people also have trouble accepting help at all.\n\nI can't really speak to the Jon thing fully, as I know there's some really deep stuff going on that I am pretty ignorant of not being black or part of a black community. It sounds like he feels her rejecting the \"black business\" label is rejecting the part of her that is black, and that gets into some really complex feelings- it sounds like Jon is black and is taking that perceived rejection *very* personally. Ruining her business isn't really a great way to lift her up as the role model and business he thinks she should be. He seems to be missing that Jane identifies as multiple races/ethnicities and the nuances that brings up. Someone should help him realize that his efforts would be better spent lifting people up (like Krystal does), than in tearing someone down. He sounds like he has some things to work though with the whole telling people they think they're above other blacks (???) but tearing them down when they don't meet his standards for behavior.

You can't be \"equal\" and \"special\" at the same time.  Making laws specifically for one group of people does nothing but add to the fires of inequality.  Two wrongs don't make a right.  Making things unfair for a certain group of people is not balancing the ledger.

I don't agree with this 'professional' company bs, you're contractors, your work should speak for itself, personal presentation is rarely an issue. This is how it works in the UK. For me the fact that this is an issue is just internalized racism or something and everyone is somehow agreeing with it. Yes the face tatt is dumb but it's not a big deal, it's only a big deal because people are equating black people with being inherently unprofessional and they have to \"fight harder\" to be professional. My guess is there is a lot more to this story and more unprofessional workmanship on site, but OP kind of stuck on the tatt as it was the most glaring evidence of un-professionalism.",

Visibility. No vehicles in front of me.\n\nThis woman just pulls out directly in front of me right as I'm approaching the intersection. I literally only had time to hit my brakes and realize we were going to collide no matter what and then we hit. Both kids in the back seat.\n\nI have never been so infuriated in my life. Absolutely and positively enraged. Seriously, the only thing that saved this woman is that once I got the kids out and safe and she was on the side of the road by us is that she was older and clearly confused. She kept saying she didn't see me and that she thought I would stop. An accident like this was my fear for my grandma when her boyfriend kept giving her her keys back even after her dementia was too advanced for her to safely drive, so I ended up feeling bad for her. Even typing this raises my blood pressure. I really hope her family has taken her keys away.",

                "Had this happen at Costco with a guy trying to pull his boat into the shaded spot beside me. I had my doors wide open trying to load my loot and child in. Guy got visibly agitated that I wasn\u2019t going fast enough. He really lost it when I had to go return the cart with said child still in it, of which I offered him the cart so I could load my kid and go. So, I went back to the cart return, leaving my doors open into the spot, so he couldn\u2019t fit in. Needed the vent the heat in the car anyways. After I get my kid in, he pulls in, gives a nice \u201cf you\u201d in my direction (kid\u2019s door closed at least) and goes in and gets a cart. I don\u2019t know what it is with the type of people who shop there but it\u2019s not the first asshole I\u2019ve interacted with in the parking lot.",

I educated him on the fact the speed limit is still 25mph because the hump isn't steep enough to require a signed 15mph limit.

Then, when an opportunity presents itself like this and someone is just an in-your-face asshole, they don\u2019t realize, all the patience and fucks are gone. Especially since the kids may be having crabby, sick, tired or just straight up bad days and they have been acting out all day. I don\u2019t like conflict and try to do my best to keep the peace but there are moments that become perfect storms. Getting a screaming baby, in the heat, while they actively resist getting in the seat and are tired and ready to go home is most definitely one of those moments.  Dudes lucky you didn\u2019t scream at him from the depths of hell in your voice and then camp out in the spot while hanging your middle finger out the window.

Any jack ass with a pair of eyes can see what you're doing and how long it can take to load a kid into a car (on top of anything else you had). \n\nHonking at someone for taking too long sounds like a \"I'm a fucking idiot who is blocking parking lot traffic for spot stalking and now I feel like an asshole because a line is forming behind me\" problem",

If you want Chaos Dwarf DLC money, I want Chaos Dwarf DLC content. \n\n\nChaos Dwarfs was just four months ago, so your inflation take was already THERE with raising THAT price. Which also got debated, but was accepted more easily by the masses. Which in hindsight might have send the wrong message, but that is up with the people who preordered that DLC. The SoC content, as good as it might be, is nowhere near the Chaos Dwarf Quality or Quantity. So if you want that kind of money, you better bring the SoC DLC on the same level as Chaos Dwarfs. Or, you ask for less money and go back to \"fair prices\" you think you had in the past. We all know you will not reduce the price. We also know the next three DLCs will have the exact same price tag. So if you want to sell them, better do something for them now when you still can. Chaos Dwarfs is the bar you set up for this price tag to pass. If you want to limbo under that bar, like with SoC, then its your problem if the sales are not going as expected.",

I was really waiting to see if it was at least a little better value than first impressions and to see what they did with 4.0 in general. Like, maybe they worked their asses off on fixing bugs and adding in some quality reworks here and there and just weren't able to add as much to the DLC as they had planned but the higher-ups were already dead set on a $25 price tag. Not ideal, but I could stomach it. And in terms of value for the DLC itself, the value of it has been creeping up in my opinion as they show off more and more off it.\n\nBut now, after this response, it seems apparent that I'm not supporting the game I love by overpaying for the DLC.

Without that kind of mortgage there wouldn't have been nearly the crisis and junk to hurt banks that held them. They got reevaluated to near ZERO value.\n\nAll the packaging and CDOs and all the other gimmickry was really bad, but the worst of the Wall St. garbage was letting someone sell insurance on a thing without being a regulated/licensed insurance firm and selling the insurance to someone who didn't own the thing being insured. It encouraged people to blow up things to get the insurance, though that would never have fully paid off, if at all.\n\nAll this is in the movie The Big Short and it was discussed at length during the crisis.

Honestly the rest are no better than those that came before them. The bloodline story with Reigns at the helm has run its course. His Summerslam match (and essentially every other match he is in) was basically a repeat of Wrestlemania with Jey as an opponent instead of Cody. Austin Theory is a solid heel both in the ring and on the mic, but him holding the belt hostage for nearly a year isn't doing anything for him IMO. The women's division is just a mess right now. Bel Air is pretty good, but I don't think she is as good as they are making her out to be. Flair is good, but after 15 title reigns, her time to shine has ended and she is propping up other wrestlers.

When you are at work, there is nothing that makes you feel better than a productive day. Some days it naturally clicks, and other days, nothing seems to work, even after giving your best effort. It is highly   effective if you can reset your thoughts once in a while and approach things freshly. Meditation is a wonderful way to zone out, reset your mind, and relax yourself. Especially when you are working on a complex task or having a brainstorming session, it works miraculously. Don't underestimate this technique, it is tried and tested out by many people, a lot of work cultures around the world are starting to incorporate  this.

I wrote off meditation as either nonsense or something I just could do correctly.\n\nYears later I stumbled across a 28 minute guided meditation and decided to give it a try and it was a complete game changer. I finished that 28 minutes feeling more focused and simultaneously more relaxed AND more alert. The problem before was that I was attempting to do something brand new, and only giving myself 5 minute chunks to figure out how to do it.\n\nIn follow up practice, I've learned that I personally need at least 10 minutes to get any benefit out of meditating. My base level of anxiety and mental chatter is so high that it takes 5 minutes of sitting still and focusing on my breath before I start meditating.\n\nJust something for newbies to consider, if you've try 5 minutes of meditation (or have tried it in the past) and get nothing out of it, maybe give yourself a longer chunk of time to get a feel for it.",

They can\u2019t be tuned because the steel in the wires has crystallized over the decades and they are likely to snap if stretched, leaving the tuner responsible. In past decades the solution was to loosen the wires rather than tighten them, tuning the piano down half an octave. This gave rise to the \u201cHonky-tonk\u201d sound typical of that era when pianos couldn\u2019t be tuned accurately. But nowadays few tuners will even tune to the honkytonk octaves.

The police force (our officers are decent) is also really struggling for the same budget cut reasons. They basically can't help with anything anymore unless it's a real serious crime. I'm talking legitimate CCTV footage of an identified person stealing a bike will go nowhere. The government is just keeping all of the taxes and not spending it on anything right now.\n\nPay is generally awful too, Minimum wage on 40 hours a week is \u00a321k/year, yet computer science graduate jobs are...

In America, since businesses and stuff pop up all the time, the American economy can pick up pace after a recession much faster than other countries.

                "I'm a leftist, but I'm always wary of people who think Europe is some socialist paradise. Their capitalism is not as advanced in its malignancy as ours, but they're still capitalist countries and all the horrible devices that have been tried in the US are soon to be rolled out over there. Because you're right, OP; even though the basic QOL is higher in the EU right now, they still have wage slavery and poverty and the same sharp, mostly-hereditary social distinction between owners and workers, with almost no transit upward into the former.\n\nIt's not our privatized industry or work culture--our work culture is fucking dogshit; even Japan's is less onerous and oppressive--that make the US more robust, though. The reasons our country is robust are:\n\n1. **We have a lot of natural resources.** This doesn't seem like it would affect daily life, but it's huge. Alaska pays people to live there. Cheap gas meant people could live far from work instead of crowding into \n2. **We speak the world's lingua franca.** Whatever product you build here, you have about 400 million native speakers and 1+ billion secondary speakers for the language you use.\n3. **We have a lot of land, and also a number of different productive cities.** Real estate prices have become a nightmare, but that's everywhere; thing is, most EU countries (actually, most countries in general) have only one or two cities where you can live if you want to have a career. We have about 20. So, even though our cost of living crisis is horrible, it's not quite as bad for the mobile middle class--it is, if you want to live in an expensive dystopian city like New York or San Francisco, but you can actually get good jobs in places like Pittsburgh and Minneapolis.\n4. **The U.S. historical middle class benefitted from the Cold War.** So, to a lesser extent, did the middle class of other Western countries, but, the bulk of the war-machine opportunities were in the U.S. The reason there was a decent job market for middle-class Americans for so long is that the state forced there to be; it would simply hire people the private sector would not. During the Cold War, the elite of the U.S. feared the Soviets more than they feared their own middle class, so we got \\~40 years of \"nice guy\" capitalism... but that ended. Although the widespread opportunity started to weaken in the 1980s and died out for good after 2008 crash, there's still a fair amount of that residual wealth kicking around. \n\nIn sum, (1) the U.S. has a lot of natural advantages that have nothing to do with the economic system and (2) our economic system isn't that different from theirs--theirs is just a (temporarily) nicer version. Like all countries, the U.S. has its share of virtues and vices, and its economic system is more of a vice, but a sad truth of history is that the moral rectitude one's economic system is not the most important variable in determining a country's prosperity or power.",

Other big banks (Chase) were sooo much easier. \n\nAlso, are you under a FTHB program? If so, that would be the reason the bank is being like this.

The loan was for\u2026maybe 300k\n\nThree weeks of documentation and processing went by\u2026.24 hours before closing, their underwriting department asked for some ridiculous and irrelevant documentation about my current residence that also required notarization/wet signature.\n\nI recall the email I sent to my broker, it pretty much went like this:\n\nDear (broker),\n\nThis is not fucking acceptable. You know everything about me, my finances and this property. You have asked for, and received all documentation, and I\u2019ve been paying you for 8 years.\n\nThis request demonstrates that either your underwriters aren\u2019t paying attention or your bank doesn\u2019t care about my business. \n\nPlease get this done, or don\u2019t.

                "Hurricane rolled thru maybe 15 years ago, Wells was my lender. I was a new home owner, early 20s. Before the hurricane I was stocking up, money was tight, but not a problem. They called me and told me in anticipation of the storm they want to ensure I\u2019m doing everything I can to prepare and that as a courtesy they would defer my mortgage payment for a couple months. I asked how that would work and he said they would modify the loan to extend the term for the length of the pause as needed depending on the severity of the circumstances. I skipped two payments. We used the money to evacuate out of town, stayed in a hotel with our pets and kids. Came home a week or so later when power was restored. I paid the 3rd month and every month after. About 6 months later I get a letter that I\u2019m in default, I called and they said that\u2019s just because their system hadn\u2019t been updated properly to account for the approved missed payments. Another few months go by and I get another letter outlining the options of either coming up with the two missed payments within a certain number of days or they are going to reissue (I don\u2019t remember the proper terminology) my mortgage, with the missed payment balance, at the new market rates (higher) and start my 30 year mortgage again . Called them to complain, didn\u2019t have the two missed payments laying around. I ended up having to accept the offer. Fortunately I had improved my situation since then, paid off the loan after selling the house for a sizable profit, and have moved on, but I will never deal with Wells Fargo again for any reason after that experience.",

Or how they processed all debits before all credits, causing foreclosures and no funds fees? During Covid-19, I was working there. They had a fully automated process to handle any PPP loan for a corporation, but if you were a small business, it was fully manual process. So all corporate PPP loans would immediately process, small business ones spent weeks processing.

Their appraiser comes out and gives us a figure which I don't remember, but then out of nowhere our payment goes up by 250 a month.  \nHuh?!?!  I call them only to find they attached flood insurance to the existing mortgage.  No warning, no letter, phone call, nothing.  I called them and reminded them the house is, A)  on a hill so steep that every polar ice cap could melt, and it would not flood, and, B)  FEMA and ACoE do not list it in a flood area.  Their response was \ud83d\udd95\ud83d\udd95\ud83d\udd95 too bad.  That's the way it is.   Obviously, we got out from under them, but I still remain shocked at how brazen the thievery was.",

                " The responsibility will lie in various factors, including monsoons, inadequate production, and extreme heat.  The reason for high prices can be traced back to their sudden fall in April-May, which led many growers to abandon their crops. The unusual heat of March and April also saw pest attacks that took a toll on production.  The first batch is planted in the month of January-March, which results in the first batch of produce during April-June. The Rabi crop fetches better returns for farmers too. the rabi crop, which is grown mainly in the Junnar taluka of Maharashtra and in parts of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, comes to the market between March and August. After August, the market is supplied by the kharif crop in Uttar Pradesh, Nashik in Maharashtra, and elsewhere in the country.  However, the harvest was affected this year by the sudden heat waves and flooding, as it led to pest attacks on tomato crops, resulting in lower produce and higher market rates. The leaf viruses led to such havoc in Karnataka and Maharashtra that the local Agriculture produce market Committee which received nearly 5.50 lakh quintals of tomatoes in June last year has got just 3.2 lakh quintals this year.  Then comes the unseasonal rainfall in May, the supply of tomatoes has been disrupted in the past weeks from the producing states, where the harvesting and transportation process have been adversely affected. In mid-July, the Department of Consumer Affairs directed agricultural and consumer cooperatives to immediately procure tomatoes from mandis, or vegetable markets, from high-production states like Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Maharashtra to redistribute to major cities including Delhi and Mumbai.",

If California Democrats are trying to undermine ballot initiatives, how is this different than what Ohio Republicans did?\n\nEdit: Since this article doesn't describe the details of the reform bill, I went and found [another article that does](https://www.capradio.org/articles/2023/03/22/proposed-bill-would-overhaul-referendum-petition-process-in-california/). TLDR is that the bill is very different from the Ohio proposal and actually looks pretty good:\n\n>The bill would require campaigns to disclose key information on the front page of the referendum petitions, like a summary of the measure and the names of its top three donors, in an effort to increase transparency. It would also introduce additional government oversight in the signature-collection process: Paid signature gatherers would be required to register and take training courses with the Secretary of State\u2019s office. And at least 10% of signature gathering efforts would have to be done by volunteers.\n\nIn short, this bill *empowers* CA voters rather than disenfranchising them Ohio-style. Better transparency is always a good thing, so the first three quarters of this bill are a slam dunk. I can see arguments both for and against the last requirement for 10% volunteers, so that part is probably worth discussing more.",

This isn\u2019t the first time the owners have dealt with homeless-related crimes in the area.\n\nThe employees in the area said a church nearby feeds the homeless, so they flock there every day, but they also linger and cause destruction at night.\n\nVideo shows multiple people walked up to the Headspace Salon in South Austin and threw rocks into the front glass.\n\n\"In the last probably two months, we\u2019ve had, easily, well over $10-15,000 worth of damages,\" Headspace Salon and Co-op Owner Laura North said.\n\nShe said, as a small business, it hits hard.\n\n\"They\u2019re just coming there and smashing things with rocks and just walking off and not understanding for small business owners that is a huge, huge financial hit for us, and it\u2019s just not sustainable,\" North said.\n\nOther businesses nearby have been dealing with similar issues.\n\n\"The guy came around and that\u2019s when we had the rocks, we saw him on camera, we got him right over here. He threw it on the second floor window and busted out the window in the hallway, and then he busted out the window around this corner, and he busted out that window,\" said Jason Dawkins, an estimator who works in a building that was vandalized.\n\n\"We see a lot of drug use, a lot of open sexual behavior, a lot of defecation and urinating in public areas and a lot of that stuff, and I will say it seems like some of that has gotten better, but it seems like definitely the vandalism and the kind of destruction, especially later in the evening has gotten significantly worse,\" North said.\n\nNorth said this chaos is caused by homeless people and the city is to blame.\n\n\"We need the city to help. I feel like they kind of helped create this problem, and we\u2019re just in the wake of the destruction,\" North said. \"I wish I could send the mayor or city council members the bills for all the vandalism over here, but that\u2019s not going to happen.\"\n\nIn February, the city cleaned up the encampment located at Pack Saddle Pass and Highway 71. North said there was a sense of relief.\n\n\"We got comfortable, and it felt so good to be able to sleep at night and I didn\u2019t have to worry about getting calls for break-ins and just terrible things,\" North said.\n\nSince the Housing-Focused Encampment Assistance Link Initiative, or HEAL, started in June 2021, 618 people have moved from high-risk encampments to the city\u2019s Southbridge and Northbridge shelters. North said the problem is back, though.\n\n\"The city will step in kind of help very briefly, and it does not last long, and then it just goes right back to how it was before,\" North said.\n\nDawkins said his patience is wearing thin.\n\n\"You got all this homeless money that you\u2019re saying you\u2019re going to do something with, do something with it, put your money where your mouth is, put our money where your mouth is and do something with it and take care of the issue,\" Dawkins said.\n\nThe employees in the area said in order to deter this behavior, they need police patrolling the area constantly.",

If you take people who used to be able to support a whole family on a single salary and put them in a world where it requires two or 3 jobs, there will be people who cannot do that and they will end up in the streets.

Most people that are homeless aren't doing this shit, but you don't notice them bc they're the ones that stay out of your way. Cut the problem qt it's roots.

                "Article\n\nKevin Bakhurst, the RT\u00c9 director general, has said the broadcaster\u2019s coverage could be reduced if the decline in TV licence fee payments continues in the coming months.\n\nThe national broadcaster is facing a \u20ac20 million hole in its revenue by the end of the year after a 30 per cent week-on-week drop in licence fee revenue compared to 2022 since late June following the controversy over secret payments to presenter Ryan Tubridy.\n\nSpeaking to the Business Post, Bakhurst said that he \u201csincerely hopes\u201d the public begin to recognise actions taken to rebuild trust in the organisation but that \u201cyou\u2019ve obviously got to look at various worst case scenarios\u201d if the decline in TV licence revenue persists.\n\nBakhurst said that \u201cthe longer it goes on the more you\u2019ve got to look at other options\u201d including cutting coverage and reducing the broadcaster\u2019s spend on its digital transformation.\n\nRead More\n\nBig Read: Kevin Bakhurst\u2019s first 30 days as RT\u00c9 boss\n\u201cBut we are robust in terms of cash for this year,\u201d he said. \u201cIn my view, next year is a challenging year in terms of spending at the moment.\n\n\u201cWe have cash in the bank but we can\u2019t be complacent about that,\u201d Bakhurst said, who replaced Dee Forbes as director general in early July.\n\nThe broadcaster has already requested \u20ac35 million in interim funding from Minister Catherine Martin\u2019s department, which recently initiated two external reviews into the RT\u00c9.\n\nBakhurst confirmed to the Business Post that the drop in licence fee revenue has been raised with the government in the context of the interim funding model for RT\u00c9.\n\n\u201cIn the discussions I\u2019ve had, and I\u2019ve been personally involved in some of them with the department, the discussion about the licence fee has been on the table,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI would hope, and again this is in the hands of the gods, but I would hope that interim funding would also take account of the level of public funding and the level of licence fee income to reflect that drop,\u201d Bakhurst said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve given [the department] all the financial information they need and they can make their own decision based on the facts from New Era which is entirely appropriate.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for the department said the recent decline in TV licence fee sales \u201clikely reflects public sentiment following the revelations about certain payments by RT\u00c9.\n\n\u201cWhile it may be premature to draw any conclusions as to the overall impact of TV licence revenues for the year on the basis of recent sales figures, the department will continue to monitor this situation over the next couple of months.\n\n\u201cOn the question of funding for RT\u00c9, the immediate focus of government is on the work of the examinations of RT\u00c9 that Minister Martin has set up, and RT\u00c9\u2019s own reforms.\n\n\u201cHowever, the Future of Media Commission had recommended interim funding for RT\u00c9 pending a decision on the longer term funding model for RT\u00c9. The Minister will be considering interim funding again in 2023, as part of the Budget Estimates discussions.\u201d",

If she comes to you saying anything like she did when you were running salads to the bar. You're response - \"I'm busy\". Is enough. That's it. No further explanation is needed. A good server would step up and run their own drinks esp ones w/ specific instructions esp when she can see y'all are in the weeds, but you let her know you will go in order, if she wants it out sooner, she can take it, but you aren't switching up your order of flow.

The government preaches common prosperity and then it is left to the diverse and disparate local governments and businesses to find a way to 'realise the vision', often competing against one another to better accomplish it.\n\nIt has also worked extremely effectively in terms of the green transition with that being another core tenet.

I haven't done any statistical analysis, so this could totally be a normal amount of Sweet Businesses to run into, but anecdotally, I seem to be running into a lot of Sweet Businesses. \n\nIs there some sort of protest going on? Or organized trolling? It seems like it's a lot of new players, because they don't seem to understand that you should stun unstoppable champs before unloading your heavy on them, but if that's not it, why all the Sweet Business?\n\nEdit: I should note that only one of these Sweet Businesses was a Titan, and that one didn\u2019t even have Actium War Rig on, which, as a crayon-munching bonk hammer-pilled Titan, should be a hangable offense.

So far I\u2019m enjoying learning to code so I would say it\u2019s been a good choice and the wages for jobs in the industry just keep rising, so once I graduate I\u2019ll have good options. I can only do this because my parents are happy for me to live at home whilst I upskill, otherwise I couldn\u2019t afford to do it. To be honest all three are good options, I chose uni because it\u2019ll give me more of the lifestyle I want in the future and more options for locations to live.

                "I went through a sort of similar situation in 2019 with my business ultimately being crushed under the weight of the beginning of the pandemic. There is no handbook for how to get through this, all I can offer is some anecdotal advice. \n\nYou might feel like a failure, but that\u2019s far from the case. You risked it for the biscuit, and that\u2019s something to be proud of because it\u2019s more than a lot of people ever do. Sometimes risks pay off, sometimes they burn you. It\u2019s part of the game. So try to look at this as a learning experience. For example: you\u2019ve been burned by investors in the past, so take this time to think about what type of partner you would want in the future. Really dig deep and think about what went wrong and embrace the lesson. Write down what you discover about yourself. \n\nYou have a very unique experience in that you\u2019ve helped two restaurants get started. You\u2019ve been through the chaos of opening days, you\u2019ve scrambled to adjust your systems as the business got going, you\u2019ve seen things get built from the ground up. Even if they didn\u2019t work out, you\u2019ve learned the importance of adaptability, you\u2019ve (hopefully) learned what kinds of questions to ask, you\u2019ve probably developed intuition for what won\u2019t work. Take these experiences and learn from them! You often learn a lot more from failure than from success. \n\nMy advice right now is to find a successful restaurant and go work for them. Pay attention to what they do well and why they are successful. Take time to regroup before jumping into your next leadership position. Think about what you want out of your career and your life. Keep your nose to the grindstone and keep building your skill set. Things will work out in the end. If they haven\u2019t worked out, then it\u2019s not the end yet.\n\nI felt like an immense failure when I closed my business. Felt like I let my friends, family, and community down. I put everything I had into it, financially, emotionally, mentally, and physically. The plan made sense on paper, I was addressing a neglected corner of our market, my product was fucking good. And it just didn\u2019t work out. Sometimes that\u2019s how it goes - the ball takes an unlucky bounce and you lose. I lost nearly everything in the process, but the result was true freedom. I was able to let go of what was burdening me and move forward with some priceless lessons and a refined perspective. We are a sum of our experiences, and that experience has paid dividends since 2020. \n\nI\u2019m not sure if any of this is helpful, but just know that you\u2019re not alone.

This is a rough fucking business.\n\nNow for the cold callous shit that I see a lot of chef-owner types seem to struggle with. Your food can be the best in the world, but if the rest of the product isn't right for the concept, if your planning and reacting for and to things isn't close to perfect, you will fail.\n\nAt the end of the day, restaurants are businesses, and therefore sell a *product*. Not food. Food is part of a product, and an important part, but not the only relevant part. The product restaurants sell starts before people ever set foot in the establishment. What does the decor/signage look like? How does the building itself fit in with the stuff around it? Whether people acknowledge it consciously or not, all this, and every other detail affects their experience, and choice to either spend money and keep spending money, or not.\n\nOwnership stake demands that you either attend to every detail of what customers are buying and not, or go out of business and in to debt. *This* for those who give a shit, is what \"The customer is always right\" means. If you offer a product that doesn't sell, it isn't the fault of the customer, it is your fault for offering a product the customer isn't going to buy.\n\nMore applicable to the OP: getting fucked by an investor is *rough*, and doesn't sound like it's your fault except in extending trust somewhere it didn't belong. In the words of one of the first sous chefs I worked under \"Trust no bitch.\" Someone else made the sauce on your station? Taste check it, because it's your ass if it isn't good. Not the fuckhead who made it.\n\nThe same kinda applies here. Don't *ever* extend trust with money. Not to friends, not to family, *especially* not to business partners who could fuck your life sideways with one lie. For friends and family, money is a gift you give, and if they return it, it is a pleasant surprise. For business partners, cash up front or get fucked is about the only safe way to proceed. And *always* get that shit in writing, preferrably with witnesses and a lawyer or two.\n\nIts a business before its anything else. Treat it like one.",

Never had an issue with them and it's always been cheaper than the dealerships ive dealt with for maintenance/repairs. \n\nThey replaced my starter twice (first one went out withing a year so the second was free), my coolant system, and my fuel pumps. I always have them do my oil changes and tire rotation and it's still a reasonable price (2013 Ford Focus), I think they charge me $65-70 for that.

                "I\u2019m in a similar position with my side hustle but I no longer have a 9-5 let me warn you of some things.\n\nFor me the biggest consideration is the stability and longevity of your side hustle. If it fluctuates (at all) you\u2019re going to slightly panic if that\u2019s your only income stream. You currently sleep well at night knowing you\u2019re diversified and if one or the other were to fail you\u2019d have an entire 6 figure income stream to fall back on. That\u2019s an extreme blessing and not something that should be taken lightly. When my 5 figure per month side hustle has a bad month it\u2019s hard on me and my situation because there\u2019s no fall back plan. (At least not yet, I\u2019m working on a second stream)\n\nBefore you take any advice from people in here consider 3 things: \n\n1. A $12,000/mo job is a fantastic job most people would dream of having. I would be realistic and ask, how likely is it you could land another one at a similar pay? If you\u2019ve spent years working your way up with little education, you need to be very careful considering leaving and realize the decision is more permanent vs a programmer with a degree that could find a 6 figure job at any tech company when needed.\n\n2. Is it really truly your time your business needs to scale? Or could it be money? (Coming from your 9-5 job). Could you scale with an employee for less than you would be missing out on $12,000/mo from your 9-5?\n\n3. Is your business scalable? You need to be honest with yourself about the scalability of your business, there are 5 figure/mo side hustles out there that are simply not scalable for whatever reason. Be honest with yourself.\n\nNow on the other hand quitting your 9-5 will free up so much time and lift a burden off your shoulders to either really blow up the potential of your business and scale quickly or get really lazy. Don\u2019t take advice from Reddit people that don\u2019t run your business, weigh the options, heavily consider the downsides of both (no longer diversified income vs not being able to scale because of time constraints). Once you\u2019ve done all that remember you only live once, do what makes you the happiest, but be smart (: \n\nBest of luck! \ud83d\udcaa",

You'll be earning income on it and it'll be there if your side-hustle doesn't work/slows down.

That labor needs to save to invest in small businesses, but can't.\n\nReaganomics is a broken background.",
                "What struck me the most from this article was the notes about how information awareness is the new driver for market success.\n\nWhen we look at the story of the information age, it seems to be having more and more parallels with the industrial age. Consolidations make powerful players even more powerful and the cost of even _entering_ a market become ever higher. Look at the rail industry 150 years ago and ask yourself what sort of impact an uppity startup could have. An uppity startup isn't going to disrupt the railway market by creating new rail lines or undercutting existing locomotive manufacturers.\n\nThere's a certain tipping point where a smaller, independent player couldn't possibly disrupt the existing industry on their own. By the time someone invents, say, an efficient diesel-electric locomotive that will make steam engines obsolete, there's no way in hell they could start your own independent railroad that only pulls trains with their fancy new engines. They couldn't possibly have the capital to manufacture the locomotives themselves, let alone acquire new rights-of-way for their lines.\n\nInstead, market disruptors have to rely on patents and other intellectual property to somehow bend the existing, monstrously large companies that control their respsective industries.\n\nNothing has changed since then. The huges player have access to the most powerful tools. Since antiquity, the biggest tool aside  from money itself, is information. Here in the Information Age, the most powerful tools are, of course, tools about information itself. It's not enough to collect incredible amounts of information. It's not enough to merely summarize those incredible amounts of information. What's required for supremacy\u2014and often even for mere survival\u2014is the ability to _comprehend_ that information.\n\nUntil recently that has all been handled by two broad technologies: spreadsheets and databases. In the late 1990s and early 2000s a new concept came along: the data \"warehouse.\" But still all those are good for is summarizing and consolidating _data_. You still have to have a human comprehend the data, to comprehend it in exactly the right way. Now it's the mid-2020s and there are tools *that can comprehend the data for you*. Many of those tools have made their way into the hands of ordinary consumers. But obviously huge corporations have those tools as well, and probably they can afford much better tools than what you could run in a minimized window on your laptops.\n\nI say that\u2014but do they? Is there a ChatGPT subscription level that can do better analysis than you or I could afford? The answer is \"sorta.\" The _methods_ aren't all that different. Many of them are open-source.\n\nWhat's different is the size of the dataset, and the CPU hours you can afford to lease for the AI to understand it for you.\n\nImagine if your AI could train on a dataset called, for example, \"All the data that General Electric has ever collected in any database ever.\" Well, General Electric has one. And BP has one called \"all the data BP has ever collected in any database ever.\" As do Deutsche Bank, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Berkshire Hathaway, Walmart, Meta, the CIA, the NSA, and, well, literally every company in the world.\n\nBut a player like Berkshire Hathaway can do a lot more by applying commodity tools to _their_ data than your local realtor could do with theirs. And Berkshire Hathaway could definitely buy our your local realtor, and then quietly merge your local realtor's dataset into theirs.",
                "Capitalist legal theory\u2019s incestious nature breeds capital consolidation. It does not promote competition, it seeks to eliminate competition.

For decades, that institution has churned out shit like a fertilizer factory.

Poverty is growing. \n\nWorked Benefits have shrunk: lower healthcare coverage, 401k instead of a pension. \n\nEducation lending has explosive growth as government reduced financial support. \n\nOur government was bought off by the money realized when Citizens United allows massive cash flow to politicians. The cash has curtailed the growth of worker wage protection while relaxing business taxes.. \n\nThe crash of the economy is happening. College attendance is down. First car ownership is dropping. \n\n69% of Americans cannot afford a $1000 emergency. Credit card spending is over a trillion dollars. 401k withdrawals have increased. And no one in government is taking these warnings signs seriously...",

                "LeMay and other Air Force generals were also in a new era of aerial warfare, where militaries were still trying to determine their best use. They had at first experimented with precision bombing in Europe (and then in the Pacific theater) with negligible success and severe casualties. By precision bombing I mean targeting only specific factories, infrastructure, and military sites. The idea was to cripple the opponent and deny their ability to wage war, thus forcing their surrender. The problem is it didn't work. The technology had not caught up yet. \n\nThe other problem was that the civilian population was as much a part of the war effort as the military. Civilians worked the factories, farms, warehouses, etc. As American production showed, the ability to manufacture was critical. Add to this fact that manufacturing in Japan was also generally done not in centralized locations, but across multiple small personal homes/buildings. Total war was brought back.\n\nLeMay himself led precision bombing runs in Europe, experiencing the casualties firsthand, and this may have influenced his negative view on on the strategy.\n\n\"...if you are going to use military force, then you ought to use overwhelming military force. Use too much and deliberately use too much... You'll save lives, not only your own, but the enemy's too.\" -LeMay\n\nPeople also tend to forget that by this point Japanese  atrocities against the Chinese, Americans, etc. were common knowledge, and this helped garner a much more savage brutality in US/Japanese engagements. The idea of fighting the Japanese on land in \"fair and honorable combat\" had long gone out the window (see Guadalcanal and other encounters). \n\nI still question for how long two sides devoted to each other's destruction can maintain moral high ground.",

                "From what I'm seeing, a lot of people don't seem to realize that lemay had previously tried to engage in precision bombing. Before the fire bombings, lemay sent in b-29s at 30,000 ft with the intent of simply destroying 1 to 2 select buildings. When the bombs were dropped, the bomber pilots noted that their bombs were blown WAY off course due to the jetstream, which they knew next to nothing about at that time. Out of the 400 something bombs dropped, only 1 hit the intended target. So, the only viable way to bring the enemy closer to surrender was total and indiscriminate warfare. \n\n      Plus, why aren't these comments being hurled to the british? They were the first in the war (on the allies side) to indiscriminately bomb entire cities. They found precision bombing at night was next to impossible, so they effectively said \"fuck it, we ball\" and just destroyed the entire city. 2 birds, 1 stone: destroy the factory, AND destroy the people that work in the factory too. War is hell. Even Sun Tzu said something to the tune of \"The best way to win a war is not wage war to begin with.\" \n\n     Also, when the people are aiding in the war effort in any way, shape, or form, you COULD make the argument they are targets which can justifiabely be destroyed. They might not be picking up a gun, but they are making a gun to be picked up. If you prevent that gun from being made in the first place, that's one less enemy you have to worry about.

                "The pay disparity between servers and everyone else has been the elephant in the restaurant for a long time. All the while, many culinary professionals have invested in conservatory educations and typically come in around minimum wage even with experience.  The laws around tips have historically perpetuated this issue.   Aspects of 80/20 like the absence of an income threshold is a clear example of this favor.  For example, an employer must pay a server minimum wage, for out of scope work(ex, a server cleaning a restroom prior to opening doors), even if they make well over 6 figures.  I can tell you (but will not) several restaurants in the district where this is the case.  All the while the tip allocation has the support staff barely above water.  \n\nThe push to service fees will allow the employer to supplement wages for the whole restaurant, raising the median wage through the sacrifice of the servers income. \n\nServers will take a pay cut.  Many are accustomed to a quality of life that they do not have the skills to support here in dc.  They will leave the industry and/or the district.  This will compound the effect by impacting revenue for smaller neighborhood restaurants and bars as it will degrade a lot of expendable income.  They will adapt quickly or close.  The remaining restaurants will focus on providing service and driving sales with labor being removed from the dining room.  Quality will also be sacrificed\u2026 it already is.  \n\nMany chefs are already moving to NOVA.  This migration will only increase.\n\nA byproduct of evaporation in service teams is good old human innovation and adaptation.  Everyones information is for sale.  Everyone has a digital thumbprint.  Marketing in the four walls of a restaurant while seated will see significant growth.  Service will be ordered digitally as needed.  Menus will be interactive.  Customers will have little choice in sharing their digital profile.  Your information will be used to curate your experience narrative and impact your choices.  We are already phone puppets.  The hand just just getting further up there.  This is just the prequel.\n\nIf all the world makes is chairs, then what happens when people are no longer needed to build them?\n\nThe good news is that after catastrophic economic failure, comes the united federation of planets.

You will then be paying exactly the same amount as before and the waitstaff is taken care of.

By our consumerist lifestyles that feed the machine.\n\nUltimately the rich aren\u2019t really responsible for the emissions they are just the ones benefitting from them the most. If they stopped making cheap iPhone cables or whatever, they would lose personal wealth immediately, but the market indicates the product would be replaced by someone else the next day and our emissions would not be decreased at all.\n\nEven if we seized all the means of productions and equalized wealth, if we continued consuming this same way, the climate disaster would come equally as fast.",

You uneducated, ignorant, idiotic dumb swine, you\u2019re an absolute embarrassment to humanity and all life as a whole.\r  \n\r  \nThe magnitude of your failure just now is so indescribably massive that one hundred years into the future your name will be used as moniker of evil for heretics. Even if all of humanity put together their collective intelligence there is no conceivable way they could have thought up a way to fuck up on the unimaginable scale you just did.\r  \n\r  \nWhen Jesus died for our sins, he must not have seen the sacrilegious act we just witnessed you performing, because if he did he would have forsaken humanity long ago so that your birth may have never become reality.\r  \n\r  \nAfter you die, your skeleton will be displayed in a museum after being scientifically researched so that all future generations may learn not to generate your bone structure, because every tiny detail anyone may have in common with you degrades them to a useless piece of trash and a burden to society.\r  \n\r  \nNo wonder your father questioned whether or not your were truly his son, for you'd have to not be a waste of carbon matter for anyone to love you like a family member.\r  \n\r  \nYour birth made it so that mankind is worse off in every way you can possibly imagine, and you have made it so that society can never really recover any state of organization. Everything has forever fallen into a bewildering chaos, through which unrecognizable core, you can only find misfortune.\r  \n\r  \nI would say the apocalypse is upon us but this is merely the closest word humans have for the sheer scale of horror that is now reality. You have forever condemned everyone you love and know into an eternal state of suffering, worse than any human concept of hell.\r  \n\r  \nYou are such an unholy being, that if you step within a one hundred foot radius of a holy place or a place that has ever been deemed important by anyone, your distorted religious soul will ruin whatever meaning it ever had beyond repair.\r  \n\r  \nYou are an idiotic, shiteating, dumbass ape and no one has ever loved you. You are a lying, backstabbing, cowardly useless piece of shit and I hate you with every single part of my being.\r  \n\r  \nEven this world's finest writers and poets from throughout the ages could never hope to accurately describe the scale on which you just fucked up, and how incredibly idiotic you are.\r  \n\r  \nAnyone that believes in any religion out there should now realize that they have been wrong this entire time, for if divine beings were real, they would never have allowed a being such as you to stain the earth and this universe.\r  \n\r  \nIn the future there will be horror stories made about you, with the scariest part of them being that the reader has to realize that such an indescribable monster actually exists, and that the horrific events from the movie have actually taken place in the same world that they live in right now.\r  \n\r  \nYou are the absolute embodiment of everything that has ever been wrong on this earth, yet even that would only represent a small part of your evil. Never in the history of mankind has there been anyone that could have predicted such an abomination, but here you are.\r  \n\r  \nIt\u2019s hard to believe that I am seeing such an incredible failure with my own eyes, but here I am, so unfortunately I cannot deny your existence. Even if I did my very best, my vocabulary is not able to describe the sheer magnitude of the idiotic mistake that is you.\r  \n\r  \nEven if time travel some day will be invented, there still would not be a single soul willing to go back in time to this moment to fix history, because having to witness such incredible horrors would have too many mental and physical drawbacks that not even the bravest soul in history would be willing to risk it.\r  \n\r  \nI cannot imagine the pure dread your mother must have felt when she had to carry a baby for nine months and then giving birth to such a wretched monster as you. Not a single word of the incoherent, illogical rambling you may be wanting to do to defend yourself or apologize would ever be able to make up for what you just did.\r  \n\r  \nThe countries of the world would have wanted to make laws preventing such a terrible event like this from ever happening again, but sadly this is not possible since your horrific actions just now have shattered every form of order this world once had, making concepts such as laws irrelevant.\r  \n\r  \nRight from the moment I first set my eyes on you I knew you were an absolute abomination of everything that is wrong with humanity. I was hoping I would have been able to prevent your evil from being released upon this world by tagging along and keeping my eye on you, but it is clear to me now that not even the greatest efforts would have been able to prevent a terrible event in this scale from occurring.",

                "These are some great pieces to work with! I love the square neckline and for a long skirt, this is a perfect length. I'd definitely accessorize just to pull the outfit together. A few things I would try. Try tucking the shirt in (could be all the way, just in the front, or just on one side of your hip) and adjust the drape until it looks right. You might prefer the look. You could try a belt over it if it's tucked in all the way around. I would add a short chain/pendant necklace (you could layer two or three chains, if you wish, to add texture and interest). I really like how shorter necklaces frame the face. A watch or bracelet might be nice.\n\nPlenty options for shoes. I think sticking to nude tone or black is best (anyone else have thoughts on this?).You could try a short heel (avoid platforms or anything really tall). I don't think the shape of the toe box matters. Test it out but if they all look good, just go with what you find most comfortable (actually you should always prioritize comfort :)). Close-fitting boots (ankle, calf or knee) could work too. I'd avoid anything higher or you might see the edge of the shoe around your thigh poking out from the fabric. Go with a flat shoe if it's icy because walking awkwardly isn't cool lol (although ice would be surprising at this time of year). Otherwise I prefer a heel. Even tall heels should be fine with a boot, but again I think avoiding platforms here is best.\n\nAnd of course add a minimalist bag, or even a sleek backpack would be okay, (if you need the space).\n\nIf warmth is a concern, either go with a looser, maybe structured, cropped or long sweater/coat. Avoid anything too form fitting or hip length. You can add some colour here if you want!\n\nI know that that was a lot of info but it really seemed like you have a lot of options with this outfit and it was fun to think about! Hope this isn't too late, but maybe you will find these ideas helpful in the future.",

You can no longer get softlocked just because you don\u2019t do the Lanayru dragon\u2019s quest last.

It also has the best story and characters in the series.\n\nThat being said, yeah, there are still problems. Knowing the other HD versions had a reduced price tag makes this one having a full price tag leaves a bitter taste in my mouth. Ultimately though, I can live with that.

We have a guest list of about 170 people in a big NY wedding.  We paid $1.5k for a deposit and the rest would be 2 weeks before the wedding. This florist had been in business for over 30 years, several friends used her for their wedding and we trusted it would be a great job and professional. However it seems that\u2019s not how it\u2019s going. \n\nWe found out FROM THE OWNERS NEPHEW that it had gone out of business. Not even the owner called us. We just happened to meet him by chance and he told us the business closed. Where is our $1.5K? Well\u2026we have no idea. The florist will not answer our emails or calls.

Maybe you could use a combination of flower moxie and a local florist to fill in the gaps? That would give the new florist an easier job so they might be able to take on the event, and it would keep the cost down. That really sucks though! The owner probably didn\u2019t tell you because he didn\u2019t want you to ask about the deposit\u2026. You could look into small claims court, but you should see if you can file after the wedding so that you don\u2019t have to think about that right now.",

I hope it's helpful -- maybe too late for OP, but maybe for other couples.\n\nWithout insurance: the $1.5k you paid to the now-defunct florist is gone, and likely no way to get it back, especially if they filed for bankruptcy.  You can file a claim with the bankruptcy court (if you know how) but you're not guaranteed to get anything.  Even if you do, it might only be a fraction of what you paid, and it could be months after your wedding.\n\nWith insurance: you'd get the entire $1.5k back... maybe not immediately, but definitely a lot faster.  Then, the insurance company and their legal team might try see if they can to recover part or all of your original $1.5k, but that's no longer your problem whether they do or not.",

I highly recommend this route. Although I used Flower Moxie and had a great experience, it is definitely a skill that requires practice and a lot of prep work, and I think it would be too stressful to completely DIY with this short timeframe. \n\nYou could also lean into heavy greenery for the centerpieces and decor and maybe just do flowers for bouquets? (or some brides do greenery only bouquets). Order a few boxes of Southern Smilax online, run it down your tables, and load them up with candles and it will be gorgeous! If you do some searching on the weddings under 10k sub, a lot of couples will use a potted orchids as classy, modern centerpieces. Also, buying potted houseplants, like ferns is a great option for something like lining the ceremony aisle. \n\nIt will all work out and still be beautiful, even if it seems nightmarish right now.

The agencies heavily promoted political propaganda in MANY countries overseas and were incredibly powerful by leveraging their large influence with TWTR & FB. They also made heavy efforts to control foreign narratives on the US, this is literally the exact same colonial behavior Democrats & progressives have long been fighting against but somehow all because of Trump & the right most are too naive & blind with emotions to see that they are essentially supporting US actions of having banana republics.\n\nHow in the world are the same people who support Julian Assange, are against agencies like the NSA, now doing a complete 180 to support giving these agencies FAR more power than they already do have. Unfortunately the right only really cares about the implications back home but because of this Republicans for the first time since the pentagon papers support  giving less power to the major agencies like FBI & CIA despite 15yrs ago being supporting of muslim targetting.\n\nPS: This isnt even mentioning how loosely 'misinformation' became defined as full power was given to the White House, FBI, CIA, and NSA to define misinformation to be whatever they wanted it to be regardless of the level of uncertainty there was among leading experts. In fact the agencies began to define & control narratives and definitions of misinformation against these very leading experts but thats another seperate discussion with more of a debate to be had."

The disc by mail service and one rotating streaming subscription has been all I\u2019ve needed for a long time. I usually have my queue maxed out at 500 discs. Plus it has been my unofficial movie rating app so I could track everything I\u2019ve seen (but I\u2019ll take any suggestions if you have good ones that are streaming service agnostic).\n\nNot cool. \ud83d\ude21\n\nAnd I was all set to get Cocaine Bear in the mail tomorrow\u2026",

                "I've rented discs from Netflix since the year 2000. I remember talking my dad into buying a DVD player that came with a free trial. Growing up in a little town with tiny video stores, I had no way of seeing the great world cinema classics. There were some classic Hollywood movies at the video store, but that was VHS and the selection was spotty. When we got Netflix, the first four movies were rented were, I think, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Seven Samurai, Nosferatu the Vampyre (1979), and The 400 Blows. Netflix was when my education in cinema truly began.\n\nTo this day, I still have a queue full of movies that I don't think I'll be able to find anywhere else. People forget just how few movies are actually available to stream. When you've seen several thousand movies, you start going into the deep catalogue. Netflix didn't have everything, but it had enough that they will be shutting down before I had a chance to watch everything I wanted to see.\n\nThis sucks.",

                "Dammit, I was going to sign back up for this. I axed it during covid because there weren't enough new releases and they stopped updating their old disks but it had a better selection than any single service other than pirating. They would sometimes pull shit like advertise Criterion art and send you a ten year old different release of the same film but per movie it was much cheaper than digital rentals and blu ray quality is higher than streaming. It was still popular in areas with bad internet. Also streaming Netflix is, well, I pay for it but there isn't usually much I feel like watching on there except when one of their good originals comes out. Criterion and HBO and Amazon all seem to have better selection.",
                "I love this service, it's been so good over the years. When Netflix split their DVD and streaming services I stuck with DVD because it actually has a real selection of *most* movies. No streaming service could or can touch its selection. It has gotten worse around the edges the last couple years: some obscure titles dropping away and longer shipping times. But still this is an absolutely terrible loss.",

It's this kind of market trend that causes developers to keep building investment condos because they sell sight unseen. \n\nA good housing policy should bar people from purchasing homes they won't personally live in, and it should encourage developers to build housing that will be more affordable for families i.e. the people who want to own. \n\nPeople who want to buy homes to live in off season shouldn't be punished, these are not homes typically for investment.

A few days ago, an apartment building caught fire but people weren't able to escape due to all the exits were locked. So about 10 including children were burnt to death. The CCP of course denied everything, and people decided they have had enough of this dog shit.\n\nLots of the protesters in those videos were not covering their faces, because they already know the CCP can and will track them done through cell phones, CCTVs and all kinds of surveillance networks. Some of them are holding blank papers without any words on it, that means whatever they want to say, CCP won't allow it, but also people know what they want to say.

A co-worker came to her aid and called for help.\u201d\n\nConservation officers believe the risk to public safety in the area is low and are not undertaking any trapping efforts, the service said, in part because of the \u201cdefensive nature of the attack and remote proximity of the location.\u201d\nPrecautions against bear attacks such as carrying bear spray and traveling in groups is encouraged, the service said.",

Without them we would need to rely on Russia..., which the US did before SpaceX was able to do it.\n\nAlso SpaceX launched a lot of Satellites that you, yes YOU, benefit from. For example GPS Satellites. \nAlso SpaceX Starlink provides fast internet Access to over 1,5 Million people in this Planet who would have a slow, really expensive, or no connection at all otherwise. This is also a huge deal for scientists in remote locations and emergency/natural disaster situations where the infrastructure is destroyed.\nAlso it was and still is a huge benefit for Ukraine.\n\nYou can hate on Elon all you want but this company does Stuff that few or no other companies can do and they greatly benefit the human race. \n\nBtw. , the only thing Blue Origin did so far was launching a couple rich Guys with their penis rocket to the Edge of Space and back. They have not even achieved Orbit yet. Which means they currently have no ability to actually bring something usefull up there.",

NASA certainly wasn\u2019t getting anywhere near the moon by themselves and trusting the future of American Space Exploration to a Twitter troll is probably not a good idea. At least with this contract the risk is spread over several major companies with specialized experience in their parts of the contract. I think this is a win for everyone.",

                "Good, it's about time. Our school has a massive problem with kids using vapes, even kids as young as 11! These vapes need to be cracked down on both for marketing to kids (like back in the 90s when they made cigarette companies remove cartoon mascots like Joe Camel), and they also need to start going after stores that sell vapes to underage kids. Our school reported a store that multiple kids said sells vapes and refills to anyone without checking ID. We reported it to the state and the police months ago and they did nothing. A kid bought one there last week and got busted with it in school, so why is no one enforcing the age restrictions on vapes like they do with cigarettes and alcohol?\n\nThe problem is that the vape and e-cig companies have successfully marketed these things to kids and made them believe it's completely safe because it's not a cigarette. Anyone caught with a vape at my school is required to attend classes from the state that teaches them the true dangers and what it's really doing to their bodies and health, but it doesn't work. Kids who've done the class still get caught multiple times afterwards and too many oarents don't seem to care that their kid is vaping or they willingly allow it and will buy it for them. The parents don't even care when the kids are caught with illegal drugs I'm their vaping cartridges, which is just crazy.",
