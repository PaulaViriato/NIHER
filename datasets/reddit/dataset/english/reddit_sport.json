                "Friendly reminder that there's currently a female LMP2 driver who's closely matching her former F1 driver teammate (Kvyat) in terms of laptimes. And all this while being only 19.",
                "armchair opinion: i feel like a huge problem with F1 academy and w series is that the drivers only drive in F1 academy mostly.\n\nIdeally they would need to race in another F4 series, FRECA or whatever else there is.\n\nI mean there probably is still a phyiscal disadvantage and the fact that there are so few drivers. So if one is actually serious about getting a female driver to be in the TOP 10 of FIA F3 (which is basically the first step towards F2), they need to give them the experience necessary to get to that level. Only racing in F1 academy won't be enough. Imo Sophia is right, F1 academy needs to be something that the drivers can do in addition to another series.\n\nI mean a lot of the male driver already do 2 series in 1 season at that level.",
                "Sophia was outspoken against W series as well and for good reason. \n\nIsolating women in a weak, dead end series isn't offering a path forward. It's not going to make them better to race in a weak series and it doesn't make racing teams want to hire them because they've spent years in an isolated environment where they can't really show their skills in a meaningful way. Single seaters in general is just a poor form of motorsports to focus on, almost no driver makes it to a point where they can make a living racing in single seaters. It's F1, FE, Indy and Super Formula so you're looking at fewer than 100 drivers in the world who make a living racing single seaters. The odds of a woman making it in are just so slim and everything else feels like failing.\n\nProjects like Iron Lynx's Iron Dames make way more sense, there are so many more opportunities to make a living and be successful in sportscars. There's many more career paths, many more series to race in and make a name for yourself.\n\nedit: focusing on sportscars won't get any women into F1 but neither will F1 Academy and maybe we should first try to make women racing be a much more normal thing.\n\nedit 2: as for what to do, I think the money that's being spent on F1 Academy (which is a fucking awful name by the way, no driver there will make it to F1) would be far better spent on sponsoring female drivers in other series. Helping female drivers find seats and keep those seats at whatever level they're competitive.  Someone like Doriane Pin who through the Iron Dames project is now driving in LMP2 for Prema getting backing from, say, Ferrari would massively boost her visibility and be much more of a boost for women in motorsport than an isolated PR bubble with a bullshit name.",
                "Funded seats in junior categories (in decent teams) for the highest performing female talents would probably be more useful than F1 academy. It's already difficult enough to have the funding to step up to cars from karts (and karts are already expensive) and given the ratio of female drivers to make, it seems obvious that it's a low chance of meeting the criteria of female, rich and talented. You can't control two of those factors, but cutting out one may help get some more talent though.",
                "The thing that has separated Sophia from others, and the big reason why she's gotten the seat in F3 imo, is that she was willing to go and race everywhere in everything.\n\nI don't know if it's how it was sold, or whether she genuinely believed it, but Jamie winning the W series was always going to be going nowhere on it's own. It feels like she wasted 3 years doing nothing but that (and a couple races in Extreme E), while Sophia was driving in ELMS, WEC, DTM.\n\nI doubt Sophia will be the first female F1 driver, first points for female driver in F2 would be massive for her, but the first female driver will come from someone that's gone through other series as well, and not just F1 Academy and the Formula series (Dorriane Pin and Lilou Wadoux are the two worth keeping an eye on atm)",
                "Honestly, I\u2019m reserving judgement on F1 Academy\u2019s usefulness until the end of the season, and what becomes of current front-runner Marta Garcia. Baring some kind of unfortunate circumstances, Garcia is set to become the F1A\u2019s first champion in October.\n\nOne of the critiques of W Series was that the returning champion (Jamie Chadwick) was allowed to return, unlike at least F2 or F3, where the champions can\u2019t return. \n\nIf F1 Academy is serious about being a potential springboard to getting women on a solid path to F1, seeing what they do with Garcia will be key. If they\u2019re able to land Garcia into F3, it will go a long way in building their brand as a legitimate feeder series vs a PR exercise.",
                "If one of the goals of the W Series was to get people talking about women in motorsports, I'd say it's been a huge success.",
                "Start em young and keep em racing, doesn't really matter what they are, male/female/whatever, you'll eventually get good quality drivers coming from that environment. Then it's about marketing yourself, getting connections aka networking and showing you have it all to make it at the top.",
                "There is barely a physical component to competitive gaming and women are almost entirely absent from that scene. If they don\u2019t play, the talent can\u2019t reveal itself. It\u2019s that simple. \n\nThe fact is from the 4 billion boys, more of those with talent are finding themselves in racing to become talent whereas a tiny fraction of the 4 billions girls are getting into it.\n\nYou can argue that those 4 billion boys might have a higher ratio of talented people in that pool (we really can\u2019t know imo) but unless the ratio is horrifically 1 sided, there should be room and chances for the other pool of talent to produce racers.",
                "The F1 Academy should rather be a single ''junior'' team that runs cars in F2 and F3, while funding drivers in the top F3 and F4 regional series. Like Red Bull, but for women.\n\nThat way you create a pipeline where you can feed them in to higher, more competitive levels of motorsport because letting them race against each other doesn't do anything.",
                "It makes me happy that u/PM_me_giant_boobs has started this debate about female drivers",
                "A lot of people are overlooking one of the benefits of F1 Academy (aside from PR/inspiration for future drivers): track time. One of the consistent struggles for female karting talents has been a lack of sponsorship, leading to a lack of track time which makes them struggle more when starting out in single-seaters. \n\nF1A has a lot of testing for a junior series, at a relatively low cost. Amount of hours in the car correlates pretty directly to performance in a lot of lower series, and when women struggle to rack up time around the track, that\u2019s a massive road block to having successful female racers.",
                "Danica's the best female open wheel driver of all time, Sophia is the best female open wheel driver currently, so they know more than anyone about how to compete at the highest level you can as a female driver. \n\nHopefully their feedback is taken on board and results in changes as opposed to being ignored.",
                "There\u2019s really nothing stopping women from getting into F1, it\u2019s just there\u2019s not enough girls that get into motorsport at an early age. Still see majority boys in the junior karting categories.",
                "Talent and money*",
                "In my opinion they should find the most talented, very young female kart racers and support them financially so they have financial backing for junior formula.\n\nThose girls are the ones with highest chance of reaching top motorsport series.\n\nThe reality is that all the F1 drivers even the ones that we don't consider \"that\" good were very strong kart racers when they were younger, they were all winners in karting & junior formula. If somebody is not good enough to compete with other top junior formula drivers they will not be good enough for F1.",
                "I'm a woman who is excited by women's racing. But... I'm not going to shame women who don't succeed competing against men. I don't think it's crazy for some women to want to race in a women's only space, because I would never judge women who wanted to play basketball in a women's only space. Ideally, I would love to see women driving up the ladder towards F1. It's truly incredible that Danica did as well as she did in IndyCar. I don't think that pretending that the same percentage of women could make it to F1 if they really really tried than men. Women are just simply at numerous physical disadvantages. And a much, muchThe way to have more women succeed is to get more young girls (like 4-8 years old) in karting. Until a large threshold does that, it's just going to be hard. So... maybe once F1 Academy is actually on tv and supported by F1 teams, and all the other great changes they intend to make by next year... maybe it will inspire some parents to let their 4 year old girl try karting, or let their 7-8 year old girl enter competitions.",
                "I'd like to add that you don't become an F1 driver \"by chance\", you have to be rich, or heavily sponsored, and \\*\\*insanely good\\*\\* \n\n  \nJust a little recap for those who don't know: in order to drive in F1 you need the so called \"super license\", which is obtainable by getting 40 points within 3 years, [points assigned as such.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIA_Super_Licence)\n\n  \nWe can say that, overall, just a tiny percentage of drivers have both enough money to be competitive in those minor series and enough skills to actually win or get good placement in those. And this is only to being able to race in F1, winning a GP is a whole different matter.\n\n   \nAmong those drivers, there is just a tiny percentage of women. Tiny multiplied tiny equals tinier, it's sheer numbers, has nothing to do with skills or gender-related differences, if there are 10000 drivers and only 100 of them are women is statistically easier finding a championship winner among the 10000 than 100. And when you think that only 10 drivers (11 with Danny) of the grid were able to win a GP it's clear that having a competitive girl in F1 will be \\*hard\\*\n\nI think that first of all more girls need to be exposed to racing at a young age, something that isn't doable by W series that was honestly so boring (plus I'm not a fan of this kind of divisions). For example the Iron Dames in Le Mans this year had a shot for victory, these women can actually inspiring other little girls in pursuing a racing career and the more girls starts karting and competing in F4-F3 the easier will be finding a worthy F1 Female driver.",
                "Just saying, Miki Koyama won the 2022 Japanese Formula Regional series, becoming the first women to win an all-gender FIA single-seater championship.",
                "Looks at submission title: \"Oh a story about female F1 drivers\"\n\nLooks at OP's name: \"Oh dear...\"",
                "I think it's a numbers game. Because of the physical demands of F1 you cannot overlook the fact that men are (on average) much stronger than women. There's no getting around the fact you need to have a certain level of strength/fitness to be able to complete a race distance in a competitive way.\n\nThen there's talent. It's hard to quantify talent, but I have the feeling that there is just a way larger pool of individuals that are 1. physically capable and 2. have the talent to succeed in F1 being men. Naturally the opportunities to get to the top must be made equal, but I sincerely do not hope that women will be granted special treatment just for the sake of having women in F1. The best drivers need to be there, regardless of gender, but I don't think we need to force it too much.",
                "Motorsport is one of the few sports where men and women are 99% equal. Because it doesn\u2019t require peak strength or anything like that. It requires endurance training. \n\nThough, women don\u2019t get the same opportunities as men in motorsport. And thats the thing that needs to change.",
                "What is needed is to have a larger pool of women in racing.\n\nAs a simple thought experiment; If there is only 1 in 100.000 drivers (regardless of gender) that are good enough to reach Formula 1, and you have 1 000 000 guys actually in the racing sport you will find 10 potential talents among the guys.\n\nIf there are only 75.000 women in the racing sport in total you may never find one talent at all.\n\nGetting more girls and women into the sport will create a larger pool of drivers and consequently increase the likelihood of talents coming into their own.\n\nIt\u2019s the same thing across all sports to be honest. The larger pool of active players you have the more likely you are to find and develop the rare talents.\n\nWhich is why I always support growing the communities such as encouraging women and girls to get into sports that are male dominated. Lets bring the numbers up so more talents are able to find their calling!\n\nI can\u2019t even imagine how many talents missed out on becoming superstars just because the sport was too dominated by one gender or the other, so they never gave it a try, or never even had the opportunity to try.",
                "I wonder how Reddit will spin this. Even though Sophia herself agrees I'm sure redditors who are not female open wheel racing drivers will sure tell her how disillusioned and unaware of the complex dynamics she is in her own career.",
                "Everyone says the goal is to get women into F1 but that\u2019s not a realistic goal to start with because it\u2019s the top of Motorsport. Once women start to populate the lower series and other forms of racing, a women driver in F1 would make so much more sense.",

                "I'm no expert on the matter, but to me it looks like they have an issue filling up the women's series in general. More competitors means higher level of competition. There needs to be several leagues of W series, not just one, but it looks like they just don't have enough female drivers willing to pursue professional racing. Ideally, every year those lower series should be producing enough drivers with skill level and talent similar to that of Chadwick's to fill up the grid of the premiere women's series. And then the winner goes to F3. Maybe I'm completely off the mark here but that's my impression of how it's supposed to work.",
                "I give kudos to Sophia because she has actually tried and this season of F3 she has actually looked better than before. She is more experienced and it shows and that's because she has actually been driving in other competitive series and not in the token W Series. I have always believe that the money they spend on it should be used to basically give young women the opportunity to race in different series starting in F3 for example like a scholarship. That way they will learn against decent rivals not the way they are doing in W series. Jaimie Chadwick in my opinion wastes too many years in there she should be doing what Sophia is doing but maybe she doesn't have the sponsors but someone that has won so many W series titles should be in F3 not in indy lights.",

                "Would not a proper test be to dump W series and all that and just......race with the boys?\n\nEven in karting the girl to boy ratio is tiny. It's not about equality and all that. If the selection pool is already tiny that tiny selection pool has to have a stand out driver and then you progress to from that with all the normal hurdles boys still have.",
                "You all don\u2019t get it. The FIA and F1 setup the W Series and F1 Academy just to tick certain boxes and boost their ESG scores. They know that these women don\u2019t have a snowball\u2019s chance especially if they join F1 Academy. The first female F1 driver will either be someone who does well in F3 or wins Le Mans in any of the classes. Not this segregated nonsense. or",
                "I don\u2019t get it. You\u2019re either fast enough, or you\u2019re not. The stopwatch decides. If a girl destroyes everyone else in the carts, she\u2019ll be picked up and move on from there. Like any other talent.",

                "Either the women go through the ladder or don't bother W series F1 Academy however you want to call it will not do anything. Floersch scoring a handfull of points is way more impressive than winning 3 w series and drowning in Indy NXT looking at you Chadwick",
                "I think over time more women will compete in top series, but you just can't ignore the fact that motor racing has always been THE male sport. If you want more women in the top categories, it has to be a grassroots movement, i.e. it has to start in karting. I'm pretty sure there are many talented girls out there, but as karting costs a shitload of money, they never even get a sniff at better junior series. \n\nAlso shoutout to Michele Mouton, the GOAT.",
                "I agree aswell, if there\u2019s a woman driver, who\u2019s quick and has the funding. She will make it to F1, currently that area is dominated by men due to whatever reasons in society itself",

                "A lot of people don't seem to realise that the reason men continue to have the competitive edge in most sports is because women have been gatekept from them for so long that they're lagging behind on development. It's like entering a season in the final race of the season.\n\nIt doesn't help that people keep saying \"women's sports don't bring in the money and viewership\". If you leave it at that it won't ever develop and it'll remain unfair to women forever. Doesn't matter how reluctant you are or how much more boring it looks than top level competition, if you want equality in sport you'll need to start investing your time and energy into it.\n\nIn a sport where a level playing field has existed for a longer time, it is entirely plausible for women to dominate just as well as men if not better. Tennis is a fantastic example of this with Serena and Venus Williams, Naomi Osaka, Maria Sharapova, etc.",
                "The most dominant female driver was put against boys and she was dead last wasn't she? We need to stop trying to force this \"We aren't treated equally\"; you are treated to your skill level and that is just of a 14 year old prodigy who tends to be male. You don't see him driving against drivers above his skill so nor will you get the chance.",
                "Regardless of what our modern world would like to think, or even just to like, the major single seater categories are physically demanding. F1 is incredibly physically demanding.\n\nThis means that to compete properly at that level you must be physically capable. That means that males have the advantage over females.\n\nI would love to see competitive female drivers in F1 (actually I would love to see genuinely competitive F1 regardless of gender) but there's a very good reason as to why most sports are split between a male and female category.\n\nEdit: I'm getting downvoted. I guess this is because A) this is Reddit and B) there are a lot of people here who have no real understanding of what it takes to drive an F1 car.\nThis edit will also lead to more downvotes; I can live with that \ud83d\ude01",

Same with MotoGP. \n\nI'd like to see a study where for example a 100 female drivers and male drivers would be compared to eachother. And then from there we can get a better knowledge on some kind of an average.\n\nOn top of all this, the drivers are usually born from money and/or get good connections through their karting careers, which can lead them to get financial backing. If we really want more female drivers, we not only need more of them in the first place, they should be born from money and/or find sponsors that want to support them and will properly support them, then have enough of them succeeding in the junior series and other series before F1. And being good enough that any of the teams in F1 would be interested to have one/or two in their team. Assuming that all this you have had the needed support (not only financial) to get here. And being mentally prepared that people might not take it well when a woman is in a male dominated field. Especially as a driver. Also not to mention if they wanna be a mother.\n\nIn addition, the way people tend to be hostile to non-male motorsport fans. It gives the same energy as with video games. Girls are not encouraged in to motorsports as much as boys are. Or parents who force/coerce their daughters to become motorsport athletes. \n\nI don't know how the F1 pipeline actually works, so correct me if I got it wrong.\n\nTo put it short, there are many reasons why there aren't that many girls and women in motorsport.",

Nothing will improve until it is common for parents to encourage their girls to get into karts and drive, rather than stand on the sidelines applauding their brothers.  \n\nWomen are constantly underestimated. Remember when they were banned from marathons and the women's track Olympics stopped at 400 metres - because us girls were all too weak and wimpy and anyway our wombs might drop out? Now look at the female athletes coming back to athletics, cycling, rowing etc. within months of giving birth, which is one of the most physically demanding activities in life.\n\nI'm absolutely not ruling out the biological advantage men have naturally - muscles, bones, heart, lung volume etc: women succeeding in a male dominated sport will probably always be outliers. But FFS give them a chance.\n\nI agree with Danika.  Get them into karts, sponsor and fund the good ones and let them compete against the guys.  These things will take time, but until they have equal opportunities to succeed or fail like the boys we will never know.",

                "TalkShite hates United, get used to it mate. Ever noticed how they invite an ex Scouser or City players to talk shit about us on weekly basis during the season? Ever noticed how they never talk about their own clubs? Ever noticed how there's never been a former United player at all, nevermind being asked to talk shite about our rivals?\n\nI genuinely think that any journalist outlet that mostly spread toxicity, among other things like half true information and such, should be made illegal. And yes, I'd very much say that if the roles were reversed. This unnecessary negativity impacts everyone without knowing and there's literally nothing good coming out of it. They're single handedly making the society shittier for their own profit. How's that tolerated is absolutely beyond me.",

Talksport are a bunch of twats but they\u2019re literally reporting facts. He played shit, take it on the chin and move on and be better or fuck off out the club.",
                "Yea I'm sorry but I don't like family members try to defend players like this. Just adds more fuel to the fire for these media outlets. Actual fans known Mount hasnt played a PL match since at least Feb iirc so Mount has some time to impress.",
                "Lol. He couldn\u2019t make it ONE GAME at United before having a go at the biased media? This is going to be a long season isn\u2019t it",
                "I've actually got no sympathy for his brother or him here. That isn't abuse. Those are (contrived and pointless) statistics. If you can't point out that a player didn't do much of anything without it being called \"abuse\" then what can you say?\n\nMount cost \u00a355m and wears our most historic shirt number. Damn right his performance yesterday was not good enough.",

                "I can recall Mount several good interceptions and tackles yesterday on top of my head",
                "I think Eth got it wrong yesterday as nobody looked good. You can already see that a midfield of Bruno and Mount is unbalanced",
                "yeah, and once a player comes out and shares their hardship and story like Dele Alli, then everyone's going to act like saints as if they've been on their side all along. It's disgusting",
                "Lol, if Mount\u2019s brother lost his cool to the troll clowns after one game, he is going to have a tough life supporting his brother wearing number 7 at United. We are the most hated club hahaha.",

                "Those are some awful stats \n\nWorst debut as far as I could remember, lad was completely invisible, seemed to be a boy playing with men",
                "I always wondered why Mount was a starter for England, but I've been impressed since I'm watching him more closely. The dude plays the right way...the stats will come.",
                "Hes right but hes literally feeding the trolls , first Pogba , then Maguire   and now Mounts brother just causing unnecesary hassle",
                "Sucks to see this, but truth is, they\u2019re not wrong. He was abysmal. That said, I think it still is a function of ETH\u2019s tactics. He should\u2019ve been asked to play deeper.",
                "We didn\u2019t pay 64 million for him to play like he did yesterday, no matter how good and kind of a guy he is",
                "Football discourse is at an all time low. Its all about gotcha moments and whataboutism.",
                "Hmm, weird to see everyone sticking up for mount in here when it\u2019s been the funniest joke in the world to do this to Maguire for the last 5 years or so.",

                "Soft. He was bad. Players shouldn't be exempt from criticism sorry",

                "The numbers are still unacceptable for a Manchester United midfielder, let alone the number 7.",
                "A successful eighteen year career, for sure. Everyone remembers those multiple CL titles he won when he was 5 or 6 years old",
                "I agree but also your bro just cost a club \u00a360 mil so expect to get criticism if he's not banging goals in.\n\nI dont know how footballers still have such thin skin still.\n\nIf i got paid 200k a week id let people come to my house and shout abuse at me whilst im counting my money \ud83d\ude02",

                "Can't believe they've done this after a 1:0 match. Bottom of the barrel insight. Mount was poor but he wasn't useless either. Showed great determination and strength on the ball. Something we need desperately in midfield.",

The pressure is on him, he's paid handsomely to perform. No one is saying he's a twat let's bully him, they are pointing out his performance.\n\n Yes with context he needs some time to get going but this is part of the job. It's a performance related task performed in front of the public.\n\nBut also fuck talksport",

                "As a United fan, I don't understand this from Pavard's perspective. Sure a top team needs strong depth, but presumably his wish to play CB is second to his wish to be a starter. He's a great player but Varane and Martinez is a balanced and settled partnership. We all know what Varane's capable of but it's Martinez that stole the show last season. Varane provides the aerial presence. \n\nAt 30m there are plenty of teams he would definitely start for at CB.",

He was expected to be the far clear most superior CB for us, but he wasn't. Overall full season, Varane wasn't clearly better than Martinez. I hope Varane will be fully adjusted to Prem now and become like top 3 CBs of the whole league as he's supposed to be.\n\nPavard would get minutes mostly because Varane tends to be injured every now and then and we have many competitions to play. I'm excited with the thought of getting him nonetheless. I hope he's fine with being a rotation player. Oh and ETH does deploy 3 CBs system sometimes so that would be nice for Pavard.",

            "selftext": "I\u2019ve recently started cycling as my lovely boyfriend bought me a new road bike for my birthday. He\u2019s already a seasoned cyclist and is part of a big community of various cycling groups and since he started riding he\u2019s always encouraged me to get on board. Running is usually my thing but I thought why not give it a go, as we can share this hobby together. However, since I\u2019ve started cycling I have noticed how much more men there are in the sport and I\u2019ve to feel like the sport is less inclusive, than say my usual sport, running. For example, before we settled on the best bike we visited a number of various bike stores to get a feel for different road bikes, I started to notice that the store assistants would speak to me differently compared to my boyfriend, oversimplifying their descriptions or in their responses to my questions. While I am new to the sport I like to consider myself a bright individual, (I have two degrees and a good job), and I guess I\u2019m not used to being spoken down to. I shared this experience with my boyfriend and we then decided to visit a store which has more female bike options, in the hope that we\u2019d have a different experience, and I told my boyfriend that I\u2019ll do the talking when we got to the store, which he happily agreed to. When we entered the store we passed two sales assistants and we both said good morning, both of the sales assistants completed blanked me, even when I made an effort to make eye contact, they both addressed my boyfriend instead. I was quite frustrated by this and later on I asked for help by a different sales assistant, he showed me a few bikes, but spoke to me in a very condescending and patronising tone, I asked my partner to take over asking questions and I noticed a huge difference in his delivery, if anything he was trying to impress my boyfriend with his knowledge. Despite going to different bike stores this experience continues to be consistent. I\u2019m starting to feel like you\u2019re more respected as a cyclist if you\u2019re a man? I\u2019m interested to know if this is just an unlucky experience or if other women have experienced this too? And more importantly, should I continue to expect this as I begin my cycling journey.",

                "I do not think cycling itself is a male sport- I have many female friends I cycle with and I find that the major brands have amazing gear for women.  I think bike SHOPS are VERY male centric and generally staffed by bike bros.  I hate dealing with bike shop bros and try to avoid at all costs. I now have a trusted bike mechanic that I use for everything (he is not associated with a bike shop) so I know there are good ones out there.  My advice- don\u2019t give up, once you get a bike that you love you\u2019ll never have to go to those bike shops again.  But yeah, they pretty much suck.",
                "First of all congrats on the road bike. Cycling and running go together like peanut butter and jelly.\n\nSecondly: unfortunately, bike shop dudes can just kind of.. be like that. I'm lucky enough to live in an area with a few women-owned bike shops where the experience is different, but yeah. It can definitely be a boys' club. My only suggestion is to go to the shop by yourself in the future so they are forced to address you and only you. Although it can be difficult to assert yourself, don't let dudes talk down to you. Everyone starts at the beginning and deserves respect for trying new things. Don't be afraid to ask a lot of questions.\n\nA few tips: learn some basic bike maintenance/bike anatomy so you're prepared in the future to ask for what you need at the shop. Park tool makes great YouTube videos for basic maintenance. You don't have to do it all yourself, but if you're specific with your mechanic about what you think is happening, they can diagnose and treat issues faster.",

I'm in a profession where I'm very much in the gender minority as well, so I get the condescending attitude in many facets of my life. I call it out where it's worth it; I find my allies (or least sexist bike shops); I reset people's expectations where possible that I've done my research and am informed and mechanically inclined. \n\nAs for the comparison with running, do you think that sexism would rear it's head there if the entry to that sport was much more than a pair of shoes?",

Oh my, where do I begin.\n\nIn short: no, this isn\u2019t just your \u201cunlucky experience\u201d, you are not crazy, and this happens in a lot of bike shops, with some bike fitters, and some people on group rides.\n\nIt is very unpleasant and puzzling at first. I let myself be intimidated by that type of attitude when I was new to cycling. I\u2019ve been actively riding and doing events for only a year, I\u2019m still learning every day, but as I get more and more experience, it gets better. Firstly, my confidence grew and I don\u2019t give a shit anymore about some bike shop dude\u2019s attitude. \n\nSecondly, I noticed that being able to communicate from a place of knowing what the fuck you\u2019re talking about really helps. Once they understand I know what I\u2019m looking for - they relax and treat me as an equal (ish).",
                "As a woman (and not a man like most commenters), cycling feels heavily male-dominated.

But if you\u2019re like me, that makes you wanna go even harder. Yea I\u2019m a woman but I\u2019ll drop you so fucking fast. (Find more of us over at r/ladycyclists)",
                "One of the things I notice most is just a default male assumption, all over the sport. Men have more bike clothing options; people on sites like this one assume by default that the other people participating are men. I've had people call out to me \"Cool bike, bro!\" on the street \u2014 there's no harm in that, but it is a symptom of the broad presumption that the person on a road bike in lycra is probably a dude.\n\nMy local bike coalition (as well as many of the local shops) run [events](https://sfbike.org/women-nonbinary-bike-sf/) aimed at women/femme/nb people \u2014 rides, maintenance workshops, etc. You could look for similar events in your city. But honestly the fact that I'm in a famously liberal and queer-friendly city probably makes these events more common, and perhaps a little less urgently necessary. As a woman who bought my first road bike 4 years ago in my mid-30s, I didn't actually encounter much sexism/condescension from the various bike shops I visited. (I don't really do group rides, which is another place people often encounter these issues \u2014 so I can't speak to that.)\n\nSpeaking as a customer/observer, my impression is that there's a genuine challenge that faces bike shop employees: you can be really off-putting to someone who walks in BOTH if you assume too much knowledge (because then they feel stupid/unwelcome), and if you assume too little knowledge (because then they feel talked down to/disrespected/underestimated). The best bike shops and employees manage, via interpersonal and rhetorical skill, to speak in ways that can meet a customer wherever they are: it's genuinely impressive! Bad bike shops often haven't developed those skills, and sometimes they rely on toxic, ugly assumptions to get around it: women/POC aren't serious riders, a guy with a fancy bike knows a lot. I would keep looking around your area at other shops: even though I didn't encounter sexism that I noticed, I definitely encountered shops where the people were just *better* at having a conversation with me about what I needed.\n\nAs a few people have already said, r/ladycyclists is the place to discuss this with greater depth.",
                "Women tend to outnumber men when it comes to running at least in my area so stores are used to catering to women.\n\nMany bicycle shops have the exact same attitude as car salespeople, women are stupid and can't understand the finer points of a mechanical device. Women also apparently are incapable of educating themselves on what they want out of a bike. Men tend to think we all want a pretty pink bike with tassels and a basket on the front. When we were shopping for my bike, SO walked out of the store to force them to talk to me. They looked very perplexed when I started asking questions about group sets, hydraulic vs mechanical disc brakes, etc.",
                "Your experience has been similar to mine.\n\nAlthough I am a CPA who owns an electronics manufacturing company and does her own mods on her racing boat, when I walk into a bike store they apparently see a ditzy blonde who probably knows nothing and will only be interested in discussing the color of the bike.  The last bike I bought, I had researched and only had a few questions before buying, but the store employees didn't want to bother to even walk over to help me so I left and ended up spending my $4k+ in another shop that was willing to spend a whole 10 minutes with me answering 3 questions.\n\nThe sport isn't necessarily only for men, but the bro culture doesn't help in attracting or encouraging women.  Even many of the non-bros are subtly patronizing, not approaching things as one would an equal but instead as a benevolent superior protecting a weakling or inferior.\n\nIf you read this sub for a while, you'll quickly see most of the discussion is by men for men.  Or men buying bikes for women.  If a question is asked that has to do with women, responses steer the poster to women's subs.  But at the same time, we see and answer countless posts here about balls and other topics mainly of interest to men.  Heck, even on this thread, you're already seeing the bros come on an judge others (fat people shouldn't have Pinarellos, etc.) because so much of this sport's culture is men in lycra who believe all cyclists should be judged against their standard of men in lycra racing or training to race - all others are ridiculed, unwelcome.\n\nIf you want to ride, then ride.  Ignore the BS as best you can.  Help point it out when you have the energy, just be prepared for the blowback.",
                "I have experienced this too, and I won't spend my money in shops where they talk down to me, but I've more often than not experienced a lot of enthusiasm and encouragement from bike shop guys (I honestly can think of one woman and she was mean) from the time I was a beginner. It's a totally male-dominated sport, but also filled with a lot of open-minded and kind guys, especially in shops. Many really like to see more women riding.\n\nMaybe the difference is that you are going in with your boyfriend? Honestly in that case I think they believe that they are selling him the bike. If you were going into a running shop for new shoes with a boyfriend who was a runner, getting you into the sport, you might encounter the same. Yes, it's sexist, but the way to get away from that is to go in on your own, and talk to them about what you want.\n\nIf this attitude persists, as it does with some people, in that case try a different shop. I always bought bikes for myself on my own, so I was the one asking questions and the one they had to pitch. If I didn't understand the value of x over y, I made them explain it. On the whole I prefer lower-key local shops, I tend to have the best experiences there. \n\nI do a lot of my own bike repairs now and the guys at my local shop are never condescending when I go in looking for parts or asking questions - this has been a common experience for me across bike shops, with a few notable exceptions. On the whole it's much better once you build enough base knowledge to talk shop and suddenly you are just another bike person.",
                "This is exactly why my wife hates bringing her car in for absolutely anything. For the most mundane and simple procedure, the store assistants will treat her like an absolute idiot.\n\nI think this is just one of those things where men can't shake the stereotype that women are dumb and uninformed when it comes to their hobby which, in their minds, is a very masculine area. \n\nNot much you can do about it other, other than perhaps calling it out when it happens to you. But I can assure you that there are many men out there (not typically working in those stores though) who definitely respect you for riding a bike.",
                "From my experience yes - cycling is a male dominated sports. Especially when you look at races.\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for me too, that man at the bike store explain things to me in a simplified way or that the guys in the group ride think I won\u2019t be able to keep up. When something\u2019s broken on my bike I get told that my boyfriend will fix it. Oh and the comments I get when I perform better than them. (This is of course not the case for all men and I really don\u2019t think they do this on purpose.)\n\n\nGood thing is, there are still a lot of woman who ride (and are very good at it) and we are becoming more and more. I personally believe we should do our best to make cycling as inclusive as possible. And until that is the case, let\u2019s show the guys that we are capable of repairing our bike and pushing hard too. Leave the fun of cycling to the men? Duh - no!",

They've been in the sport since they could pedal and moved to places with world class riding (and skiing) and they get \"mansplained\" to CONSTANTLY about cycling (and skiing) stuff.\n\nWhen my one kid moved to Vancouver, she immediately started building a Whistler DH bike.  Try being \"just a girl\" shopping for a 200mm fork.  Painful.",
                "This is definitely very common, but not universal. I am extremely loyal to my bike shop specifically because they are not like this, and I try to order through them whenever possible because I need them to stay in business. I have found a loose correlation between shops that are extremely focused on brand new road bikes and this attitude. My favorite bike shop specializes in vintage bikes and their general laid back, find the right bike, for the right purpose, for the right person vibe also seems to translate to perhaps less-rigid gender ideas.",
                "In short yes, cycling has done a terrible job incorporating women.\n\nIt is one of the most tech heavy sports, so it attracts a bunch of tech geeks which are typically guys. \n\nThe sports roots are based in Europe which has historically lagged the US in incorporating women.  \n\nIt is so heavily male dominated that there is yet a women's grand tour. So right now the female version of Lance Armstrong has no way of racing other then trying to joint a men's team....",
                "I'm male, so I can't speak for your perspective. I just want to point out that bicycles were absolutely instrumental in early women's equality movements in the early 20th century.  The freedom of movement allowed women to go out and participate in society without a husband to drive them. It's doing the same in parts of the world where women aren't allowed to drive today.\n\nSo I would not say cycling is designed for men at all. Maybe the sporting aspect is a bit male dominayed, but there are female cycling groups as well. The practical side of cycling is extremely femenist.",
                "Ugghh... so sorry to hear this, but your experience is not uncommon. \n\nI don't want to say that cycling is male-centric, but the fact that there is so much expensive gear and that there's a little bit of inherent competition in everything brings out some of the very outsized douchebag personalities. There's a whole lotta mainsplaining going on out there!!\n\nDo some research in your area and see if there are any clubs or teams with a large number of women on the roster. In general, if a group can attract and maintain a decent-sized membership of women, then the male component of the group is likely far less douchey.\n\nI'm male, but when I went looking for a racing team this year I zeroed in on the one in town that has a very active women's squad. Compared to the other teams I contacted this ended up being a fun group with relatively little testosterone-fueled drama.",

It's a fucking pink tax on bikes.\n\nI've got to be on my tippy toes not to have my top tube jammed up in my junk and I can't even use the fancy bento box that came with my bike as result, my seat is so slammed I can't get bottles under it and my fitter had to do something janky to even get it that low, I had to custom order cranks even smaller than the small custom cranks that the \"we're really good at customization\" bike company offered, and even with a 48cm frame the handlebars seem to be average width.\n\nPeople who say you never stand over your bike don't have standover height problems.",

There is certainly a bro culture, and the broiest of bros seem to love sucking up bike shop jobs. \n\nCycling is a big tent though. What I\u2019ve found as a dad who rides with daughters is that the more spandex there is, the more elitist and bro-ish the culture is. Mountain biking tends to be more inclusive than road, for example. Mostly, I\u2019ve found that riding enjoyment comes down to who you ride with, and I\u2019ve always found it possible to find inclusive groups for me and my girls without too much hassle.

                "Cycling doesn\u2019t have to be a male dominated sport but it is in part due to societal pressures that keep women more attached to the home. \n\nBroadly, women and particularly women with children are more likely to have hobbies that can involve kids, support the household through domestic labor, or be squeezed in. Cycling can be an time intensive activity and requires coordination with a partner to allow someone with a kid to go on long rides. It is also much more challenging to bring a small child along. \n\nI\u2019m not saying any of this is okay, but it is broadly why we see less women in sports like cycling, golf, adult sport leagues. In theory, this will improve as more men take an equal role in domestic and mental labor in households. \n\nhttps://people.acciona.com/diversity-and-inclusion/gender-inequality-leisure/?_adin=02021864894\n\nhttps://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2013/06/10/another-gender-gap-men-spend-more-time-in-leisure-activities/\n\nhttps://revisesociology.com/2018/05/18/gender-inequality-leisure-time/\n\nhttps://www.bamae.com/blogs/mindful-thoughts/the-gender-hobby-gap-why-do-women-have-less-time-to-themselves-than-men\n\n(I\u2019m not saying these are all peer reviews studies but it\u2019s a good jumping off point)\n\nI deeply hate that everything marketed towards women in cycling is titled \u201clady\u201d or \u201cgirls\u201d but finding local Facebook groups specific to women and sites like Girls Gone Gravel has made me feel like I have a community. \n\nhttps://www.girlsgonegravel.com/blog/2021/4/1/making-space-for-women",

                "I've been in the industry since the 80's.  Cycling, undoubtedly, *is* a male dominated sport.  I noticed that long ago.  We could get into the why's, but that's another conversation.   The good news is there has been a push to include females for the past 20 years, notably since Specialized & Trek started their \"women's specific\" line of bikes and clothing.   Historically, as I understand it, women were at the forefront of cycling and enjoyed the liberation the sport brought them.  Maybe, somewhere along the line, they dropped off.  IDK.... \n\nThere are some booming inner-city shops that have a good proportion of female staff, sales and mechanics alike.  Those shops should provide a more equitable shopping experience for you.  Compared to running, it's a technical, gear-intensive sport.  Some people **really** get caught up in the technical side.  So much so, that's how they communicate what to buy.  Understanding the jargon and references takes experience and knowledge.  Finding *your* salesperson, or *your* shop, takes some luck and some shopping around.\n\nPersonally, I have noticed many more women enjoying mountain biking more the past 10 years.  Road biking, not so much. My guess is men have a higher risk-tolerance than women and are more comfortable on the open road.  I wouldn't let that stop you though, road biking is foundational to all other cycling and, when the roads are nice, it's a great way to go.",

I'm not 100% sure why it's got a male-intensive flavor after almost two centuries of pretty serious involvement by women, but I think it does.\n\nThat said, there *is* heavy involvement by women. Some of the best cyclists (regardless of gender) have been women, and there are lots and lots of women cycling. If the local bike store gives you a weird vibe, find another one (if that's an option where you live) and leave a google review with your experiences in it.

After a wet dirty road ride on hills I managed to mess up my indexing and got a lot of grit in my drive train and my wife and I were headed out of town and I just did not have enough time to do a deep clean.  So I called up the owner and asked if he could squeeze in a deep cleaning and adjustment if I dropped the bike off on the way to work so I could pick it up on the way home before throwing the bike on the car and heading off.  He said sure.\n\nI showed up just as they were opening up and the owner was occupied with a rental group so I engaged with the MTB bro who immediately tried to upsell me to a full 20 point full tear down tune up.\n\nI just kept saying \u201cNo, I want just what I asked for.\u201d  The kid even tried to sell be a new chain to replace my 500km old chain.\n\nFinally the owner overheard what was going on and said, \u201cDude, here\u2019s a tip on customer relations.

On the racing end where I am, it is very much dedicated to men. But I wouldn't say it's designed specifically for men, there are just a lot of bike shop bros/race organizers who kind of ruin it all. Your experience in the bike shop is something Ive experienced a lot. For example, I brought my bike in to get some tubeless wheels setup since I dont have the equipment or space to do it effectively (though I do all other maintenance and have built, from frame up, every single bike). They did a simple look-over as part of the process and tried to tell me I needed $500 worth of bike maintenance done. I told them no, it doesn't need that. But they tried to keep giving BS reasons why it was needed and I just told them no. \n\nWith group rides, due to my experiences with men/Co-ed rides, I actively seek out women's only groups cause it is such a breath of fresh air. There is no ego fest going on, no sexist jokes, and no other uncomfortableness. It really makes me enjoy the sport so much more than when I did ride with Co-ed groups. The sisterhood really shines and you feel like you're actually a part of something. \n\nThe women's side (as well as POC) of cycling is gaining LOTS of traction which is so awesome. There are still things that need improved but we are in a slightly better spot than we were say 10 years ago. There are many women owned brands designing things for women by women with women in mind.

But you can definitely find division even within the general cycling community between people who bike for transportation and people who bike as a competitive sport or strictly a fitness activity. There's jargon, there's snobbery, on both sides, and there's definitely a gender bias, and I think maybe the gender bias is more pronounced on the sport/fitness side of things.\n\nSo maybe the shop folks are focusing on the man, but maybe they are also focusing on the more experienced cyclist, the one who already speaks their language. Hard to say. There is nothing inherently \"male\" about cycling, but there is not as much female representation, and while it shouldn't be the case, there may be people who assume you are less serious or less knowledgeable because of your gender.\n\nBut find the right riding group, and I think you're good to go. Depending on how populated of an area you're in, there's probably a group for every riding style and mindset. You just need to find your people.

You being a \"bright individual\" with degrees and a good job means very little. You're new to the sport. The bike shop employees can likely see it clear as day, and what you perceive as \"being spoken down to\" is maybe just them giving you the ELI5 treatment because, again, you are clearly new to the sport. \n\nPlus, the first time it sounds like you had to bring it up to your boyfriend after the fact, suggesting he didn't perceive that anything was off in the moment, and you mention that these perceived negative interactions happen in every shop that you go.

Unfortunately while there is nothing inherent to cycling making it a men's sport, the reality is that (especially compared to running) there are simply a lot fewer women cyclists, especially at the competitive level. In our area women who race regional races may find there are only a handful of competitors when every age and ability category for men has dozens of entries (or more!)\n\nAs noted, bike shops especially tend to be dominated by male employees. Additionally, those jobs tend to be low wage and most shops provide little or no job training. I agree that you should continue to look for another shop. I would also suggest you maybe try shopping without your boyfriend so they have no choice but to address you directly. One way of looking at it that isn't quite so negative is that the employees either recognize your boyfriend from riding, or he is giving other signals that he is experienced and you are not (even unintentionally) and so the employees tend to want to direct their comments to him.\n\nGood luck, and I hope you can find an entry point that makes you feel welcome!",

That's a complicated answer. 20 years ago you could ask the same question about comic books.

I may get scoffs and sneers whenever I go shopping for a new road bike in these places (\"Do you even know how to ride drop bars?

                "In response to your main question, no cycling is for everyone.\n\nTo give the sales guys the benefit of the doubt, most of the time it's males that will be interested in the technical details of mechanical things. I can talk bike tech with my non-biking male friends (chain waxing efficiency, tire rolling resistance, aero positioning, etc.) and they will be actively interested in it and engaged in the conversation. By contrast, my SIL, who has an engineering degree, is a rehab specialist personal trainer and is super sporty and into cycling and mountain climbing and the like... has very little interest in talking bike tech. When I have tried to talk with her about it she just refers me to her husband who 'takes care of bike stuff'.\n\nSales guys should be way more conscious of how they treat people and not make assumptions about which part of a couple is the decision maker. However if 85+% of your conversations go one way (I.e. the F doesn't care and the M super cares) it can be easy to fall into the routine. Good sales/service people learn to read the group and find the decision maker, bad ones don't.\n\nI did technical inspections of race cars for awhile, and although there were more female drivers than you would expect (~40%) the person 'responsible' for the technical details of the car was usually a male, like 95% of the time. I made a couple mis-steps early on in assuming when a M/F pair rolled up the M was the one to approach, to then be directed to the F (while feeling like an idiot). I learned pretty quick to not assume and ask who was responsible for the car, it was usually the M but not always, and when the F driver was the one, I dealt with them and only them. \n\n\nThe value for a sales guy in not making that assumption about M/F is the one that treats you equally is the one you will buy from/go back to. \n\n\nI hope you can develop a love for cycling, and if you ever want to talk bike tech nerdy details I'm game no matter who you are.",

I'm sure many women have gone with their husband to buy a new car and have the exact same type of interaction. This social dichotomy has nothing to do with the sport of cycling specifically.\n\nI think, as with nearly any sporting endeavor, there are more males than females participating in cycling, but I think that comes down to the reality that men are more likely to choose a sport as a hobby vs. what most women would choose. I don't see in any way how cycling is inherently discriminatory towards women in any particular way.",

Especially the \"high performance road bike\" market, as opposed to the \"commuter/hybrid/replaced posture\" market, I'd imagine.\n\nI don't know if those shop assistants are just too accustomed to women getting dragged by their SOs to get them a bike, or being less responsive to the promise of really expensive marginal upgrades? Regardless, it's the same result of a shitty customer experience for you. I hope the industry will pick up sooner rather than later, on the fact they're largely ignoring a potential market.

I went in on a day off after gardening, driving my ancient work Jeep, and no one had a clue I was a professional, yet she approached me and helped so much.\n\nShe is my biking role model.

I say this not to segregate you, but to get you to folks with whom you can commiserate and have suggestions for LBS that treat all genders equally (or more equally). The LBS I use has a couple of female mechanics (also, they\u2019re racers), which reduces boys will boys behavior.\n\nI also encourage you to watch some YouTube videos or take some local maintenance classes (they\u2019re often free). Being able to work on your own bike and fix minor issues goes a long way towards brushing back others\u2019 subconscious misogyny.\n\nI feel strongly that everyone should know how to do basic maintenance on their bicycle, for safety reasons alone.

Their cycling group was specifically a female cycling group and while they never invited me to their group, they would make separate ride times for me to join them and get dropped \ud83d\ude02\n\nMy suggestion would be to find a lady's cycling group and that might make it a little easier for you. I'm part of an online cycling group (I say online cause we're all across the US and some abroad) that does cycling challenges via strava. While the group is primarily male, there is a decent amount of females who are active. The cycling leadership has a good amount of female staff and they regularly hold events/challenges for females only. Some members do local meet ups or travel on weekends to meet up and ride. I'm based out of California and while there are a good amount of local meet ups, it looks like a majority of the females are based out of the east coast (for our online cycling group).\n\nLet me know if you're interested, and I can put you in contact with the cycling group or the female staff.

Our local group rides can be 25-50 men and there will be at most 3 women in that group. More specifically where I live it seems like a lot of the women who ride in that group, end up moving away to ride on pro teams based somewhere near mountains so they don\u2019t stick around long if they are really good and younger.

                "These guys work in a bike shop. Regardless of what is going on with their egos, they are not scientists or even engineers. People often mistake lack of knowledge for inability to understand/lack of aptitude. If you don't want dummies to read women not doing stuff for not being *able* to do stuff you have to break this cycle. Politely call the sales guy out on their behavior. Break the cycle of letting your man handle the situation. It's not rocket surgery, read a little bit and ask some questions.",
                "I would just like to make a point when it comes to the oversimplification business.\n\nI have worked in IT for about the last 20 years, quite a bit customer/employee facing, I often have to explain topics of varying degree of difficulty to a variety of audiences.\n\na person really has a fine line to walk, and it takes a little bit of time to read the education of the audience. when a person is in doubt about how much their audience knows they often default to oversimplifying things because they have often been called out for not keeping it simple enough.\n\nwhile I even as a male have experienced heeps of elitism at bike shops. even when my wife was bike shopping and the LBS suggested a bike totally different than what she wanted, for a reasonable amount more money. my wife, to a point justifiably so got quite made about it. until I explained that I am sure they feel part of their job is to help steer you towards a good bike for your use, and I think they did so, it costs more, but its a much better bike. she bought it, even mentioned a year later she is glad she it bought it and not what she wanted.\n\nkinda like I said, I don't know what happened at the shop for you, but maybe this helps explain why you may have had some of the experiences you did.",
                "Cycling is cliquey and there are lots of pockets of misogyny. It's honestly one of the reasons I'm largely a solo rider.\n\nEven so, there are also lots of great folks in cycling and seeking them out is worthwhile. I would look for bike shops that host women/femme-only group rides, have women staff, or otherwise reach out to female (and minority) riders. You can also learn a lot about shop reputation from local cycling forums, and from local riders once you're more plugged in.\n\nOnce you have the bike and know how to do basic maintenance, you will rarely have to deal with salespeople, who can be the worst for a whole variety of reasons. If you can find a shop with community-minded staff, great, take the bike to them for work. It doesn't need to be the shop you bought it from.\n\nThe other thing is women get cat-called on bikes, but as a runner you'd already have an idea how bad your area is for that sort of thing.",
                "The patriarchy is everywhere. However, I had a completely different experience at my local bike shops (one to look, one for help with some new parts I was installing). The guys at both were great and could see I was the cyclist and my husband was just along for the ride, so to speak. The repair shop guys even said that I am not alone in needing help with installs. I think it just takes finding the right shop. \n\nAs to riding, I rarely see women on the road here, but I live in a rural area. I have no idea if my experience is representative.",
                "Come in april to the Netherlands, cycle the Amstel Gold Race. You will be surprised how many women are cycling here.",
                "The numbers of women riders has grown tremendously. Please keep riding you are welcomed on the road! Comment by old man who wishes there had been women riders decades ago.",
                "Lol, I am a Dutchie and I had the most baffling experience 5 - 6 years ago. I was cycling, but my chain fell off, so I had to fix it at the side of the road. A group of middle aged men passed by on their road bikes and I heard someone shouting with the most sincere open-mouthed voice I heard in a long time  \u201cA GIRL!?!?!!!!!\u201d *silence* \u2026. \u201cYou never see those.\u201d \nI really felt like a special alien breed.\n\nMind you that our country had some very successful woman olympic champions at the time, but recreational cycling (on road bikes) was mainly done by guys. I think because it\u2019s an equipment sport, and road bikes have the same special attraction to men as expensive cars have for example (trying not to generalise, just a theory).\n\nHowever! Everything changed with lockdown. In lockdown everybody really got into outdoor sports such as cycling and mountainbiking. Since then I almost see as much woman cycling as guys and the anecdote I wrote is absolutely unthinkable now. Main point; there is absolutely hope that it will become a more inclusive sport at your place as well. Cycling is absolutely fantastic. You can discover wonderful places by going on adventure and doing a workout at the same time. Almost everybody can do it at absolutely every level of fitness. It really changed me. I\u2019d recommend it to everybody. Don\u2019t let you discourage by the fact that\u2019s a male dominated sport. The sport needs women to encourage other women!",
                "Did a century ride a week ago, hundreds of participants,80% at least were male",
                "Like with any aspect of life cycling is more oriented towards men. However, I know just as many strong and fast women cyclists like I know men! I'm cycling as a woman for a few years now and I don't think I've experienced sexism. The only thing you have to be careful about is repair shops, if they see you are a woman they might think you have no idea, so be careful, best is to go with a man or show them you have some knowledge!\n\nOff topic, I have a few Yoga videos especially for cyclists if you are interested look at my YouTube channel in my profile."

Make a slightly bad pass that leads to the other team scoring, get ready for the media to talk non stop about your mistake for the next 2 days until you play again. Fan base is the same way. Take a stupid penalty , you better believe the fan base is calling for you to be traded that second. \n\nBut whenever a player plays well, sure it\u2019s always acknowledged but never to the same degree as their mistakes. Media will comment on how well an individual player played but immediately try to shift their talking points to someone else who might not have had the best game. \n\nI fully expect in the next couple of years for Canadian teams to overpay some of their lesser known (bottom six) players in order to keep them on the team.

States began adopting lotteries to satisfy gambling fixes, and Native American casinos began appearing outside of Las Vegas and New Jersey. \n\n* Professional Jai Alai players were (and are) predominantly Basque. As the Basque region grew and standards of living rose, the low salaries Jai Alai players were making wasn\u2019t enough. \n\n* To protest against low wages (combined in-part with some very complex socio-political issues), Jai Alai players staged the longest strike in sports history.

                "I say we should walk away. We have already overspent on Caicedo, I don\u2019t think we should overspend on Lavia as well. Let\u2019s make do with what we have in Santos and Ugochukwu. We are only in 3 comps this season, one of which doesn\u2019t start until January. I think we will be fine. Next season we should have Casadei back so our numbers for next season will be fine.",
                "Damn here I was reading the pool fans said they obviously didn\u2019t rate him at 45m so they backed out",
                "No we need him to complete dream trio, and to ruin pools season \ud83d\ude02",
                "The winners in this saga are Soton and Brighton.\n\nThey asked 50m and 100m for their players and got (potentially) 60m and 115m instead.\n\nLiverpool should have stayed on their lane and we would both get our no 1 target at better price.",
                "I don\u2019t think we need him",
                "We have Lesley and Andre and Gallagod. If he declines we should move on.",
                "We made them overpay on Lavia after they made us overpay for Caicedo. \n\nLet them have Lavia, we\u2019ve got Ugochukwu, Santos and Gallagher.",
                "Please save 60m+ now and sign some offensive players.\n\nWe have enough players in midfield.\nEnzo, Caicedo, Gallagher, lasley and Santos.\n\nIs Lavia twice the player of our bench player?",
                "Interesting",
                "That's fine. Made them pay 10 million more.",
                "This is the outcome i predicted & im happy with it. He has great potential but he is surplus to our requirements.",
                "We don't need him, but if he rejects Liverpool as well, it would be absolutely hilarious.",
                "This is caicedo round 2 lmao let's go",
                "Fuck it. Just get it done. Liverpool disaster class! Let the boy be a blue",
                "I honestly think that Liverpool are now in desperation mode, and will go higher for Lavia, so with that in mind, we should raise our bid. Make them pay Bellingham numbers for Lavia.",
                "it\u2019s fine get olise and stick with gallagher santos and lesley as backups",
                "I think Lavia will go to Liverpool and that is another 1-1 draw in transfers lol\n\nPlease Liverpool get him. We have enough players now with Caicedo and many other potential growing talents.\n\nBoehly please zip your wallet",
                "Doesn't make sense to get Lavia too.\n\nWe will end up being incredibly bloated in the midfield for the coming years.\n\nEnzo, Caicedo, Lavia, Ugochukwu, Hall, Casadei, Santos.\n\n7 players competing for potentially 2 positions?",
                "Bluff them more please, they're already 15m off their own Lavia valuation.",
                "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02this is worse than over paying for caicedo",
                "We're making them pay 15m more than they wanted to.",
                "This is fine. We don't *need* Lavia, so fucking Liverpool over like they fucked us over is enough for me.",
                "No disrespect to Lavia but I\u2019m not so concerned about missing out on him, plus Gallagher deserves a chance in this squad.\n\nAs long as we get Caicedo, that\u2019s all that matters imo.",
                "After the game yesterday, I'd rather keep Gallagher than spending another \u00a360m on Lavia. Yes, he's a good player with world class potential. But we need to sort out other areas first. We need a RW/AM and a GK. Unless someone came in and offer \u00a350m+ for Gallagher then I'll go for Lavia.",
                "60 mil is a fraud tbh.",
                "let the poor kid have one..  haha",
                "fantastic, use the money for lucas gourma instead",
                "Don\u2019t know which reports are true or not as I don\u2019t believe what a lot of other journalists say, just waiting what fabrizio or ornstein will say. My guess he\u2019ll probably go to Liverpool as he\u2019s guaranteed to start every game for them.",
                "If we get him for the agreed amount then fine, if we have to beat Liverpools bid then leave it I think. We have made them pay more just like they did to us for Caicedo",
                "We dont need lavia",
                "I\u2019m not getting why we are going after lavia , we already have santos ,gallagher, ugochukwu. Either of these 3 players can act as cover for caicedo ,even if ugochukwu goes out on loan then still we\u2019ll have santos and gallagher . If lavia comes and gallagher also stays then I think it\u2019ll be hard for santos to get game time this season considering the reduced number of games we get to play.",
                "It would be so funny if Lavia reject them aswell.",
                "He should go there and we should use the money for a goal keeper",
                "I wish we could get a 'Lavia only wants Chelsea' for this one. But unlikely. Absolute idiocy from Liverpool recruiters, costing both clubs 15m more.",
                "Liverpool played us but also played themselves even more\n\nGood job, we both end up paying 15m more",
                "Lavias price up by 15m \n\nCaicedos price up by 15m\n\nBrighton and Soton only winners from a billionaire dick swinging contest",
                "Please don't pay more now.\n\nBoth clubs are stupid to ruin each other transfers.\n\nLiverpool could have got Lavia for 50M.\nAnd we could have got Caicedo for 90 to 100M but nah.\n\nNow both clubs are overpaying from there asking price.",
                "I think he\u2019s going to Liverpool as probably think\u2019s he\u2019ll get more consistent game time there. They need a DM just as much as we did and he\u2019ll be their starting 6. He would have been a nice to have for us but not essential, though I do think he\u2019s gonna develop into an absolute monster in a few years.",
                "Fake news",
                "Wasn't his release clause \u00a350m?",
                "Not really bothered about him now we\u2019ve got Caicedo tbh. Would be a bit overkill.",
                "Honestly would rather keep Gallagher",
                "Spend the lavia money on Olise and a keeper",
                "Just fucking bid 60m at this point. We have nothing to lose. Liverpool will either increase their bid or backout",
                "We\u2019ll survive if we don\u2019t get him. \n\nOn the other hand, could you imagine if another CM rejects Liverpool for us in the same window \ud83d\udc80",
                "Don't want him for that amount, he is far from a finished product.",
                "Caicedo to Chelsea, Lavia to Liverpool as it was always gonna happening this way but Liverpool tried for Caicedo seeing nothing was agreed between us and Brighton. Hence Caicedo even to them was someone they were willing to fight for and spend a fortune on.",
                "Thank fuck. We overpayed for Caicedo which is fine because we needed him. Absolutely no point overpaying for someone who won't even start for us. Especially when they'd be taking minutes from the other young talent we have and have spent on. We've taken a big risk buying all these young players with future funds and tying them down to long contracts, it's important they develop and don't flop. And that means giving them gametime, integrating them into the first team more and more over time and not signing someone better blocking their opportunities.\n\nCaicedo-Enzo is an awesome partnership but Poch has more than enough to work with using Gallagher and Santos as backups. Especially with the likes of Ugochukwue in the future aswell after he's gained some experience.\n\nBetter still that Liverpool initially wanted Lavia for \u00a335m and weren't willing to pay more than \u00a345m until we came in for him. This whole saga's worked out great for us because we've ended up with the better player and they'll probably overpay by the same % on the player's value.\n\nIf Caicedo is valued at \u00a3100m, \u00a3115m is a 15% overpay. If Lavia is valued at \u00a350m, \u00a360m is a 20% overpay.\n\nEven if you used the buyer's valuations Liverpool are overpaying more. If we value Caicedo at \u00a380m, \u00a3115m is a 45% overpay. If Liverpool value Lavia at \u00a335m, \u00a360m is a 70% overpay.\n\nWe've ended up with the better player, who's further along in his development and they might end up overpaying even more for their player in relative terms. People are kicking up a fuss about Caicedo but Lavia is nowhere near a \u00a360m player that's bonkers.",
                "Am I the only one that is fine with this if it means we keep Gallagher?",
                "At this point I'd leave Lavia, I don't see him starting with Caicedo now here. Would rather give Santos the minutes Lavia would've got but I guess he'd probably go on loan if Lavia came in. I just don't see why we'd pay this much for a bench player",
                "Who needs Lavia when we already have Andrey and Ugochukwu",
                "Who cares about the money. We'd be taking him from a rival. It's worth it.",
                "If Liverpool does end up signing Lavia, I don't think that's an issue. As I have always maintained, I would much rather overpay for Caicedo than Lavia,",
                "What people forget is Southampton is more friendlier to Chelsea as they need our academy as well for their future prospects - other than Lavia knowing Joe Shields. Plus, if I am the player and they tell me about the midfield team that they are building, I'm going to be sold to the idea of playing with Caicedo and Enzo after watching us play yesterday.",
                "For us he would be a backup and 60m is too much for that, let them have him",
                "Labia",
                "I kind of hope we don\u2019t sign him. We should develop Santos and also Conor showed yesterday he can play that role.",
                "It\u2019s a no for me, let him go to Liverpool. We can play with all three of Caicedo Enzo and Lavia in a 433 but what happens when Nkunku comes back?\n\nI agree we need quality depth but we\u2019re in a rebuild, no europe, it\u2019s the young guns job like Lesley and Santos to provide the depth and prove to us they\u2019re ready.\n\nFor all we know in this crazy market, someone like Lesley with his frame and tech ability might be worth 60m next summer if he\u2019s given time to develop behind our starting pivot",
                "He\u2019d be silly to come to us now we\u2019ve got caicedo",
                "Honestly, I don't understand why we need to get Lavia. We have Caicedo now. 60mil for Lavia to play second fiddle to Caicedo makes no sense, unless of course it is to just jack up the price. I would rather focus on supporting Nico Jackson and maybe a GK considering Kepa is off this season. The depth in that position is poor. \n\nAlso, maybe I am wrong. We do have many wingers but for some reason they aren't convincing enough. Mudyk and Madueke are too raw, Sterling isn't up there since the end of last season. We have great CBs, full backs, midfield and CF. If only the wings were as good, it would be fantastic.",
                "Liverpools transfer guy must feel like John mcclain in die hard 2 \"how can the same shit happen to the same guy twice\"",
                "All jokes aside, why would Lavia choose us over Liverpool considering they have champions league football and he\u2019ll probably start for them week in week out?",
                "As a Chelsea fan, I don't understand how many players does it take to create a team and how many seasons are enough for a squad refresh. Bought half a squad last year, bought another half in Jan. Already had a bloated squad.\n\nBuy youngsters, cause they are talented. Buy experience, cause we want quality. But we already have an academy and players but, what the hell, let's buy some more. Why not. \n\n\nWhat's sad is, for fans, no Chelsea academy player is good enough once the club gets linked to a youngster. No player is good enough. Replace them next year. \n\nGet linked to a defender and Colwilll be up for sale. Get a defensive midfielder and sell Connor. Both these player, their only fault.... They are free and so they don't have any talent.\n\nBefore, the manager was a revolving door, now the entire team is revolving door. We sold the entire team that one UCL two years ago and we want more."

            "selftext": "Before I start, let me just clarify, Piracy IS a part of star citizen and a gameplay loop some enjoy. It brings an element to Star Citizen that a lot enjoy and it should remain. However, sport killing for fun is becoming too common and forcing people out of the game.\n\nSo yes, piracy is part of the game and pvp is part of the game but we are not playing call of duty here where everyone is spawning in to pvp the first person they see to up their frag count and KDA. PVE is also part of the game as well which some people would like to play. PVE is becoming incredibly impossible to play with the over abundance of people just looking to go out and blow up other ships to try and flex. \n\nConsideration to other players: not everyone is playing the game as you see it, and you are not playing the game as other people see it. Just because you want to play it in a PVP hardcore game mode, doesn't mean everyone else does. While I think Star Citizen would help correct this by limiting PVP to certain areas, maybe high value areas etc, there needs to be places in the game where people can PVE without Joe Blow being able to come blow up a ship that just took someone an hour to load up and get ready for their game. \n\nThis weekend during free fly, I sat and watched so many new freefly players getting picked off leaving places such as Everus Harbor and Port Tressler and never even getting to go experience the game due to more seasoned players sitting there picking them off as soon as they left the station, over and over again. At some points the new players actually quit playing and logged off because their attempt to even try the game was completely ruined at the start. I wanted to view this from a new player perspective so I spawned my little 100i that i haven't used in years and headed out to all the space stations. Arriving at Port Tressler i was immediately met with a Gladius and an Arrow that attacked me immediately. Luckily i got out of the ship and eva to the station before they blew it up. And, these were not new players. Next, i went back to Everus Harbor, Met by a Glaive and a Talon, and I was obliterated in seconds after arriving. Lastly i went to Arc Corp and landed at Baijini no problem, so i thought. As i was leaving i got hit by a Eclipse Torp.. since i had set spawn there, i respawned and tried to leave again, Eclipse Torp. \n\nNot wanting to try it again, i reset my spawn to New Babbage and just went back home. From here, I thought I would try some new player style box running missions and bunkers. I was instructed to pick up a box and drop it off at facility on MT, getting the box was no issue, however arriving at he MT mining facility to turn it in, i was met with 2 scorpius (again, in my 100i). They both approached me and said I could safely land and leave again if I paid them 400k!, while this is closer to the game play i would expect to see from real piracy, 400k from new players that start with 25k? cmon. I said i was new and only have 15k left. Shot down... I was so frustrated at this point, I just quit trying to play the new player experience and went back to beacons and bounties. Very sad experience. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPiracy is and will always be a part of the game, as it should. But not everyone wants to just PVP you all the time. If you want be a pirate, go camp shipping lanes, drug houses, breaker yard etc. Be a pirate, sport killing players for the fun of it (especially new potential backers to help fund the development of the game) and ruining their experience just to make yourself feel like a better pilot is not piracy.

I think Mount might cook for United and Onana will be decent but I think H\u00f8jlund is a massive overpay\n\nLiverpool has made good investments in Szoboszlai and MacAllister but even Pool fans know they still have injury concerns and a too thin a squad. They are trying to sign Lavia but he\u2019s as much a signing for future potential for them as he would have been for us.\n\nAll of this compared to us, who have invested in the best GK depth, signed Rice, Timber and Havertz, who have all looked at minimum decent and realistically I do expect all 3 will cook. \n\nThere\u2019s very few spots where I honestly think we need improvement (A good striker sub for Jesus and a sub for Saka, and an eventual replacement for Partey once Rice has settled into the 6 role)\n\nWith the depth and level of signings we have, it would be quite surprising for us to finish less than 2nd and the only risk is us playing CL games this season, which may add to injury and fatigue",

He's talked and douched his way into a lot of good situations because of his whole act so don't be surprised and cry when it's working.

                "J'\u00e9tais obese, je ne le suis plus voici mes conseils \n\n- Le sport C'est super, \u00e7a peut que t'aider. Mais le nerf de la guerre C'est l'alimentation. Je te conseillerai de viser \u00e0 avoir une meilleure alimentation. \u00c9vite un changement trop brutal que tu risques de pas tenir sur la dur\u00e9e. Identifie des mauvaises habitudes dans ton alimentation, et consacre toi \u00e0 r\u00e9duire \u00e7a, et une fois que ce n'est plus difficile, cherche autre chose. \u00c7a peut \u00eatre plusieurs choses, grignotage, alcool, trop de resto ou de livraisons etc\n\n\n-- niveau sport, \u00e9vite dans un premier temps les trucs agressifs sur les genoux (corde \u00e0 sauter ou course \u00e0 rythme rapide par exemple) tu risques de te blesser. Quand tu auras perdu un peu de poids ce sera moins risqu\u00e9\n\n\n-- essaye de faire un peu d'exercice tous les jours. Une heure de marche par ex. C'est bon pour le moral en plus !\n\n\n-- ne te prend pas la t\u00eate \u00e0 la salle. J'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 chez basic fit et chez fitness park, globalement les gens s'en foutent total de ce que tu fais. Fais tes trucs, te prend pas la t\u00eate. \n\n\n-- si tu sais pas quoi faire \u00e0 la salle, de la marche rapide sur tapis et du renforcement musculaire peut que aider. Prendre en muscle va influer sur ta consommation passive de calories, C'est tout bon pour toi\n\n\n-- p\u00e8se toi (m\u00eame si tu as l'air de le faire d\u00e9j\u00e0) une fois par semaine C'est bien. \u00c7a \u00e9vite de tomber dans la psychose mais tu peux mesurer tes progr\u00e8s. Attention, la balance ne fait pas tout, surtout si tu fais de la musculation. Envisage de prendre des photos pour visualiser tes progr\u00e8s. Ca aide quand la balance bouge moins \u00e0 rester motiver  (on est tous pass\u00e9 par un plateau \u00e0 un moment). Tu es au d\u00e9but, la perte est en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral assez rapide, mais \u00e7a va ralentir. C'est \u00e0 ce moment qu'il ne faut pas se d\u00e9courager et pers\u00e9v\u00e9rer \n\n\n\nJe pense que j'ai mis l'essentiel. Surtout ne te demotive pas, C'est un marathon pas un sprint. J'ai pris 2 ans pour perdre tout ce que je voulais. C'\u00e9tait long mais maintenant \u00e7a fait trois ans et mon poids est globalement stable proche de mon objectif. \n\nBonne chance et h\u00e9site pas \u00e0 mp si t'as des questions !\n\n\u00c9dit : j'ai relu et j'ai vu que tu faisais WW. C'est bien, mais il faut aussi que tu penses \u00e0 ta vie quand tu arr\u00eateras. Beaucoup de gens font ce genre de programmes et retournent ensuite dans leurs mauvaises habitudes ensuite et reprennent du poids. Il faudra sans doute que tu apprennes \u00e0 bien proportionner tes portions et tes macros (et peut \u00eatre compter tes calories)",
                "Pour \u00eatre un go muscu depuis des ann\u00e9es je peux te dire que je respecte jamais autant une personne comme toi. Vraiment, gros respect pour ta d\u00e9marche \n\nNiveau exo je ne peux que te conseiller de commencer par du rameur ( tu vas tout taffer , faire du cardio avec les avantages du sport port\u00e9.).  Pour choper le mouvement, internet est ton ami.\n\nEnsuite la cl\u00e9 c'est la r\u00e9gularit\u00e9 !\n\nUne fois que tu te seras un peu ragaillardi, vise de la muscu \"de daron\". J'entends par l\u00e0 des exercices en poids libre. N'h\u00e9site pas \u00e0 te faire accompagner d'un coach pour \u00e9viter les blessures b\u00eates.\n\nEt si t'as pas les sous pour \u00e7a. Va a la salle t\u00f4t le matin, vas voir le mec le plus bal\u00e8ze et il se fera le plus grand plaisir de t'aider. ;)",
                "En salle tu auras 90% de gens qui seront compl\u00e8tement indiff\u00e9rent \u00e0 ta pr\u00e9sence, 9% de gens qui auront plus de respect pour le s\u00e9rieux de ta d\u00e9marche que pour l'\u00e9tape a laquelle tu en es et 1% de d\u00e9biles \u00e9gocentriques que tout le monde d\u00e9teste de toute facon, tu auras aucun mal \u00e0 te sentir du bon c\u00f4t\u00e9.",
                "A priori, le seul conseil au d\u00e9but, c'est de ne pas trop viser des trucs qui sollicitent les genoux, parce que c'est la partie fragile quand on a du poids en trop.\n\nSinon, commence l\u00e9ger, regarde 2-3 vid\u00e9os pour d\u00e9butants pour avoir quelques id\u00e9es d'exercice (l'important \u00e9tant de faire quelque chose et que \u00e7a t'amuse, pas de le faire \u00e0 fond ou extr\u00eamement bien quand tu d\u00e9butes) et ignore la pr\u00e9sence des autres gens, ils devraient faire pareil \u00e0 ton encontre.",
                "Je pense honn\u00eatement que tu devrais demander \u00e0 \u00eatre accompagn\u00e9 par des professionnels.\n\nC'est tr\u00e8s facile de se blesser (sur-entrainement, mauvaises postures pendant les exercices, mauvaise ex\u00e9cution des exercices), m\u00eame pour des personnes qui s'entrainent depuis longtemps.",
                "Un \"gros\" \u00e0 la salle de sport ne devrait g\u00e9ner personne.\n\nJustement c'est quelqu'un qui se prend en main et s'en sort par la force de sa volont\u00e9. Donc ne t'en fais pas pour \u00e7a, pense plut\u00f4t \u00e0 ta sant\u00e9 et ne te fais pas mal pour rien !\n\nLa vraie difficult\u00e9 c'est d'\u00eatre suffisamment disciplin\u00e9 et d'y aller r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement. Vaut mieux en faire un petit peu que rien du tout",
                "L'alimentation c'est le seul truc qui compte r\u00e9ellement. Tu pourras p\u00e9daler autant que tu veux \u00e7a marchera jamais si l'alimentation ne suit pas. Faut boire beaucoup d'eau aussi et c'est un bon coupe-faim. Je conseille de voir un di\u00e9t\u00e9ticien.\n\nLa patience. Attend 1 ans minimum pour voir des effets appara\u00eetre apr\u00e8s vu ton poids \u00e7a sera s\u00fbrement plus rapide.\n\nLa d\u00e9ception. Il y aura des moments o\u00f9 tu en aura marre mais c'est normal.\n\nLe changement d'attitude des gens. J'\u00e9tais en surpoids mais prendre un peu de muscle et perdre du ventre a eu un effet spectaculaire sur comment les gens me consid\u00e8rent. Cependant il faut garder \u00e0 l'esprit que les gens auront toujours quelque chose \u00e0 dire, donc fait le pour ta propre estime. Tu serais supris que les plus baraqu\u00e9s sont parfois les plus complex\u00e9s sur leurs corps donc faut pas se comparer.\n\nS'il y a une bonne ambiance les gens t'encourageront, il y a pas de raison.\n\nPour finir, du courage et tu y arriveras \ud83d\udcaa",
                "Mon seul conseil serait d'observer davantage ta silhouette que ta balance, si tu commences le sport tu vas prendre du muscle or le muscle \u00e7a p\u00e8se, et souvent on prend de la masse (on perd moins en graisse qu'on gagne en muscle). Mais sur la silhouette c'est impossible \u00e0 rater.\n\nEt comme \u00e7a a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 dit, fais gaffe aux genoux.",
                "Franchement les salles basent leur busines sur de la vente d'abonnement qui ne sera que peu utilis\u00e9. Le sport c'est tr\u00e8s bien, mais comme disent les am\u00e9ricains : \"You can't outrun your fork\"\n\n Sinon ce qui marche pour le sport c'est de trouver un groupe de personnes motiv\u00e9s avec un niveau comparable. Quite \u00e0 \u00eatre l'organisateur toi m\u00eame. Du v\u00e9lo c'est bien pour d\u00e9buter, pas trop traumatisant (enfin si au d\u00e9but pour les fesses). Un groupe qui va \u00e0 la salle de muscu ca marche aussi :)",
                "T'inqui\u00e8te, \u00e0 la salle y a des gros y a des maigres et y a des baraques. Mais les baraques si ils sont baraques c'est qu'ils ont beaucoup boss\u00e9 pour y arriver, donc ils connaissent la valeur de l'effort et te respecteront pour \u00e7a. Puis la plupart des baraques c'\u00e9tait des maigres ou des gros avant.",
                "Avec ton poids, le plus simple pour commencer c'est juste de marcher, exercice simple mais qui va te faire travailler le cardio. Bon courage !",
                "Mollo sur les genoux c'est le meilleur conseil qu'on puisse te donner.\n\nFaut voir ta taille \u00e9galement mais en d\u00e9marrant calmement et en adaptant ton alimentation tu devrais r\u00e9ussir.\n\nUne pes\u00e9e par semaine pas plus, tu peux faire toutes les 2 semaines si l'envie te prend.\n\nPar contre dis-toi que c'est pas un sprint, c'est plut\u00f4t un marathon, \u00e7a prendra le temps qu'il faut mais l'important c'est le mental, c'est \u00e7a qui te fera tenir sur la dur\u00e9e, la perte de poids au d\u00e9but est facile mais faut la maintenir, le muscle p\u00e8se l\u00e9g\u00e8rement plus que le gras mais dans un volume moindre donc m\u00eame si t'as perdu peu sur une semaine en poids t'auras peut \u00eatre perdu du volume.\n\nN'h\u00e9site pas \u00e0 participer au r\u00e9union WW de temps en temps, c'est un boost moral tr\u00e8s souvent. \n\nBon courage.",

                "Pour perdre du poids d'une mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale par contre, c'est pas le sport qui va te faire perdre. Le cardio peut \u00eatre tr\u00e8s efficace si tu en fais 1h par jour mais ce qu'il faut c'est une alimentation correcte. Pas forc\u00e9ment besoin de faire des trucs de fou mais je te conseille de regarder les calories de ce que tu manges et combien de calories tu as besoin (\u00e7a devrait tourner autour des 2000/jour). D'ailleurs pour info, les gens avec des abdos visibles sont soit dop\u00e9s soit ils ont une alimentation ultra carr\u00e9. Il y a moyen que leurs abdos soient solides aussi mais l'alimentation fait genre 80% du boulot \n\nTkt que pour la plupart des gens qui vont r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement \u00e0 la salle, on se moque pas des autres qui viennent pour s'am\u00e9liorer. Ceux qui font de la merde c'est une autre histoire. Apr\u00e8s comme \u00e7a je dirais qu'au vu de ton poids, il serait int\u00e9ressant que tu aies des conseils de m\u00e9decin et que comme l'objectif ici c'est surtout perdre du poids, j'encourage le cardio plus qu'autre chose. Pour le cardio j'encourage le v\u00e9lo ou de l'elliptique pour pr\u00e9server tes genoux. La natation serait encore mieux mais perso j'aime pas trop et je peux comprendre que tu n'aies pas envie de te montrer de la sorte. Ensuite je te dirai comme \u00e7a de commencer tout doux avec peut-\u00eatre surtout du cardio et quand tu commenceras vraiment \u00e0 faire des exo pour d\u00e9velopper les muscles, tu auras des courbatures m\u00e9ga longues pendant les premi\u00e8res semaines mais faut pas se d\u00e9courager pour \u00e7a parce que normalement en 3-4 semaines les s\u00e9ances ne font plus trop de courbatures. \n\nSinon basic fit c'est ok, comme la plupart des salles il vaut mieux y aller \u00e0 des heures o\u00f9 c'est tranquille. Avant 12h apr\u00e8s 14h avant 17h et apr\u00e8s 21h je dirais que ce sont les meilleures heures. Apr\u00e8s c'est pas pratique en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral donc pas facile d'aller \u00e0 des heures comme \u00e7a",
                "Bravo pour ta motivation, je te souhaite le meilleur ! Il faut savoir que le sport en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral (cardio muscu ou autre) ne fait pas vraiment perdre de poids ou de graisse. \u00c7a contribue \u00e9videmment mais la perte de graisses passe avant tout par une changement d\u2019alimentation et une diminution drastique des sucres et glucides. Il faut que tu puisses \u00eatre en d\u00e9ficit calorique tout le temps et que tu coupes quasi compl\u00e8tement les sucres. (\u00c9viter les sodas, g\u00e2teaux, etc, r\u00e9duire fortement les choses \u00e0 bases de grains raffin\u00e9s. Donc pr\u00e9f\u00e9rer le pain complet, riz complet etc). Les fruits c\u2019est \u00e9videmment OK.\n\nPour le sport (minimum 5h par semaine) essaye de t\u2019entra\u00eener avec le poids du corps (callisthenie) pour tonifier, gagner en force et travailler de multiples muscles \u00e0 la fois), squats, fentes, gainage\u2026 \n\nBeaucoup ont conseill\u00e9 un kin\u00e9, \u00e7a parait \u00eatre une bonne id\u00e9e pour une \u00e9valuation et commencer le renforcement musculaire.

Si t'es dans une zone sympa et pas en milieu ultra urbain ca peut etre le bon plan, ca fait balade en meme temps, y a pas de chocs et tu prends vite le pli. En terme de calorie / effort c'est pas mal car tu peux tenir des heures, sachant que tu peux juste ralentir quand tu fatigues (c'est plus dur de ralentir en natation et course)\n\n\nLa marche c'est bien aussi mais moins efficace mais ca reste de la cardio et sinon la rando\n\nMets toi un podcast ou un audio book, ne force pas trop sinon tu vas etre cram\u00e9 en 5mn et joins l'utile \u00e0 l'agreable\n\n\nEn plus c'est utile, si jamais tu dois faire des trajets \u00e0 v\u00e9lo, tu pourras les faire beaucoup plus facilement si tu as l'habitude de faire du velo, et pareil tu pourras faire des marches / rando sans \u00eatre vite fatigu\u00e9 si besoin. Et tu peux trouver des gens pour le faire avec toi, personne est contre la cardio et c'est plus motivant \u00e0 plusieur. Sachant qu'en velo / marche y a moyen de discuter\n\nLe plus dur ca va rester la bouffe, surtout si tu vruels de la calorie a cot\u00e9, car tu vas avoir tr\u00e8s envie de manger",

Mais bon, j\u2019ajoute le mien quand m\u00eame : je f\u00eate aujourd\u2019hui mon 20eme kilo perdu. Et ma salle c\u2019est Gigafit. :)\n\nPour la salle : Gigafit c\u2019est d\u00e9cent. J\u2019ai fait 3 cha\u00eenes diff\u00e9rentes ces 2 derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, et ma perception c\u2019est que les cha\u00eenes de ce type sont toutes quasi \u00e9quivalentes, et tout \u00e0 fait adapt\u00e9es aux d\u00e9butants. Et comme d\u2019autres l\u2019ont dit, absolument personne ne va relever ta pr\u00e9sence, et il y a vraiment tous les physiques dans la plupart des salles. \n\nComme d\u2019autres l\u2019ont \u00e9galement dit, c\u2019est l\u2019alimentation le nerf de la guerre. Au d\u00e9but, en 30 longues minutes de cardio tu vas br\u00fbler quelque chose comme 300 calories. Ne pas manger un pain au chocolat, c\u2019est 300 calories aussi et \u00e7a prend z\u00e9ro secondes. La salle, c\u2019est que du bonus, ca remplacera pas le changement d\u2019alimentation.\n\nCela dit \u00e7a reste une SUPER id\u00e9e de d\u00e9velopper une routine o\u00f9 tu y vas r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement. \u00c7a concr\u00e9tise tes efforts, \u00e7a va te faire te sentir mieux \u00e0 moyen terme ce qui rend le r\u00e9gime plus facile, \u00e7a aide \u00e0 mieux dormir qui aide aussi pour le r\u00e9gime\u2026 les b\u00e9n\u00e9fices sont ouf. Et un jour, tu vas atteindre le poids o\u00f9 la salle peut faire une vraie diff, et tu auras d\u00e9j\u00e0 toutes des habitudes. \n\nJe serais toi je me fixerai un objectif de cardio tr\u00e8s raisonnable. 20-30 minutes de marche rapide sur le tapis ou l\u2019elliptique, deux fois par semaine. \u00c7a va te permettre de voir ce que c\u2019est la salle et de prendre tes marques, et si tu te prends au jeu, assez rapidement \u00e7a deviendra trop facile, et tu auras envie de renforcer. \n\nMais honn\u00eatement, le mieux serait quelques rendez-vous avec un pro (nutritionniste ou autre) qui pourra te guider avec plus d\u2019exp\u00e9rience que Reddit. \n\nEnfin, ce qui a tout chang\u00e9 pour moi : compter les calories. Pas forc\u00e9ment tout le temps, mais au moins pendant un petit moment. \n\nCalcule ton apport recommand\u00e9, et d\u00e9cide quel d\u00e9ficit calorique tu veux (le site Eat This Much a un calculateur simple et efficace pour \u00e7a). Et pendant une ou deux semaines, utilise une app type MyFitnessPal (et une petite balance de table \u00e0 15 balles si besoin) pour logger tout ce que tu manges du mieux que tu peux (essaye de pas trop bouffer dehors/en livraison ces deux semaines l\u00e0,  car c\u2019est plus dur d\u2019estimer). Tu vas apprendre PLEIN de choses super utiles. Tu vas d\u00e9couvrir qu\u2019un truc que tu aimes bien mais ne mange pas souvent est 2 fois moins caloriques qu\u2019un truc que tu manges souvent et que tu n\u2019appr\u00e9cies m\u00eame pas. \u00c7a va devenir beaucoup plus facile de choisir comment manger, d\u2019\u00eatre en d\u00e9ficit calorique et de voir du progr\u00e8s sur la balance. \n\nEn tout cas, bravo de t\u2019\u00eatre lanc\u00e9 sur ce chemin, et je te souhaite le meilleur !",

Le club ou je vais est ouvert depuis longtemps, donc y'a des habitu\u00e9s, quand tu d\u00e9butes c'est bien parcequ'ils vont t'aider naturellement, mais h\u00e9site pas \u00e0 demander.\n\nEnsuite le probl\u00e8me de la salle : tu peux \u00eatre motiv\u00e9 au d\u00e9but, mais si \u00e7a te pla\u00eet pas, d\u00e9velopper la discipline d'y aller peut \u00eatre dur.\n\nPour les s\u00e9ances, deux \u00e9coles, quand tu d\u00e9butes tu peux faire du full body, mais je suis pas fan et d'autres coms en parleront, o\u00f9 directement suivre un split, genre push (pecs triceps \u00e9paules) pull (biceps dos) et legs. Quoi que tu fasses, d\u00e9passe pas les 3 s\u00e9ances, tu risques de te blesser, et \u00e9vite les exercices intenses pour les genoux, et si tu te sens de les faire, fais-les au poids du corps.\n\nQuand tu vas progresser, perdre du poids et prendre du muscle, tu risques d'avoir de la peau qui pendouille, mais faut pas que \u00e7a te d\u00e9courage, bien que ce soit pas tr\u00e8s plaisant. MAIS \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 t'auras plein de b\u00e9n\u00e9fices, meilleur sommeil, plus de confiance en soi, plus apte physiquement etc.\n\nEt le plus important : la bouffe. Je pensais 60kg pour 1m87, donc je peux pas t'aider, mais \u00e7a peut \u00eatre utile de prendre rdv chez une nutritionniste ou un sp\u00e9cialiste du style, pour que tu puisses manger des trucs bons, sans te priver de tout, et pas d\u00e9velopper de TCA.\n\nTL DR : La salle c'est cool, 95% des gens sont l\u00e0 pour travailler sur eux m\u00eames et pas dans le jugement, pose des questions, regarde des vid\u00e9os, garde le mental, c'est important, et fait gaffe \u00e0 ton alimentation.\n\nAh oui et le cardio c'est bien, fait en avant chaque s\u00e9ance si tu veux perdre bcp de poids",
                "Hello, comme d'autres, grand respect pour la d\u00e9marche, il ne faut pas h\u00e9siter. Le sport est le meilleur m\u00e9dicament pour la tete et pour le corps.\n\nLe pi\u00e8ge du d\u00e9part c'est la blessure, et aussi de vouloir aller trop vite, trop fort dans les exos.\nJe vais prendre mon petit fr\u00e8re qu avait eu la meme demarche que toi, avec le meme point de depart. Il faisait une \u00e9norme s\u00e9ance de 1h30 par semaine, compl\u00e8te qui lui filait des courbatures pendant 4 jours.\nDonc fais toi un programme de depart l\u00e9ger, avec des seances de 20 \u00e0 30 minutes. Travaille par groupe musculaire, le lundi les bras et les pecs et le dos, le mercredi les jambes, et le vendredi fais cardio : soit du rameur (c'est dur le rameur) ou du v\u00e9lo ou un peu de course \u00e0 pied ou de marche rapide en exterieur. Tu as aussi les seances de work out (les methodes hiit) sur youtube.\nPetit \u00e0 petit augmente la dur\u00e9e des s\u00e9ances pour etre sur de ne pas te blesser et aussi de pouvoir petit \u00e0 petit couvrir l'ensemble des muscles et ne pas te cr\u00e9er des desequilibres ou des tendinites.\n\nD\u00e9j\u00e0 h\u00e9site pas \u00e0 prendre un coach, va voir ceux de la salle, mais si ce n'est pas \u00e0 ton gout prends un coach \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur.\nDe plus, il ne faut pas perdre de vue que tu as un objectif sp\u00e9cifique. Donc ne fais pas que de la muscu, varie tes exercices, fais du cardio, et des abdos, car tu veux avoir des r\u00e9sultats visibles sur to  corps. Et c'est tr\u00e8s important d'avoir une carotte et de voir le chemin parcouru dans la glace.\n\nConcernant le regard des autres, il y aura toujours un ou deux d\u00e9biles, mais je trouve que c'est un peu comme les sports de combats, il y a une sorte d'humilit\u00e9 en muscu car personne n'est body builder pro \u00e0 basic fit. Donc on est tous log\u00e9s \u00e0 la meme enseigne et il y aura tjs un mec plus fort.\n\nTu peux aussi faire en complement des methodes poids du corps (methode Lafay), que tu peux faire \u00e0 la salle et qui peuvent permettre de varier.\n\nCar, globalement, le sport sans aspect ludique c'est chiant. Donc se faire des variations c'est bien, pas tout le temps, car le corps trouvent rapidement une aisance \u00e0 r\u00e9p\u00e9ter un mouvement et des fois c'est confortable de laisser le corps travailler tout seul.",

Avril 2020, 27 ans je faisais 165kg, j\u2019ai profit\u00e9 du confinement pour me prendre en main, j\u2019ai d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de me fixer 1200kcal/jour sur deux repas de 600kcal, en optimisant pour le minimum de kcal/100g de nourriture, en mangeant vari\u00e9, avec un cheat-meal par semaine, sans activit\u00e9 sportive, pes\u00e9e journali\u00e8re, et photo progression tous les -10kg. \u00c7a s\u2019est tr\u00e8s bien pass\u00e9 et c\u2019\u00e9tait plut\u00f4t facile. Je suis pass\u00e9 \u00e0 103kg en avril 2021, les analyses de sangs r\u00e9guli\u00e8res n\u2019ont montr\u00e9es aucune carence. Ensuite, j\u2019ai commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 faire du sport, je me suis stabilis\u00e9 quelques temps \u00e0 110kg (d\u00e9cembre 2021). \u00c0 ce stade je faisais des tractions et des pompes tous les jours mais arrive une premi\u00e8re blessure au sport (\u00e9paule) + premi\u00e8re p\u00e9riode de gros stress au boulot => premi\u00e8re prise de poids, je ne l\u2019acceptais pas, donc j\u2019ai arr\u00eat\u00e9 de me peser, perte de motivation. Juin 2022, 125kg, je d\u00e9cide enfin \u00e0 reprendre le sport, et j\u2019atteins petit \u00e0 petit le rythme de 15h de sport/j (dont 10h de muscu en salle), avec un r\u00e9gime hyperprotein\u00e9, je continue \u00e0 prendre du poids mais visuellement je ne grossis pas. Fin ao\u00fbt 2022 je fais 135kg environ mais je suis plut\u00f4t muscl\u00e9. Le stress au boulot augmente \u00e0 nouveau petit \u00e0 petit, la motivation baisse, la motivation baisse, je me blesse \u00e0 la salle. D\u00e9cembre 2022, j\u2019arr\u00eate \u00e0 nouveau le sport. Mai 2023 je vais chez le m\u00e9decin, il me p\u00e8se. 158kg. C\u2019est le choc, m\u00eame si je m\u2019en doutais, vu qu\u2019il fallait que je me rach\u00e8te des v\u00eatements tous les deux mois. Je d\u00e9cide de prendre rendez-vous chez un chirurgien pour une op\u00e9ration bariatrique. Depuis fin juin, je me p\u00e8se \u00e0 nouveau tous les jours et j\u2019ai essay\u00e9 de faire un peu plus attention \u00e0 ce que je mange, mon poids ne bougeait plus (apr\u00e8s presque +500g/semaine c\u2019est d\u00e9j\u00e0 une petite victoire). J\u2019ai vu une di\u00e9t\u00e9ticienne le 27 juillet, j\u2019ai commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 suivre ses conseils (4 repas par jour au lieu de deux), et j\u2019essaye de me tenir \u00e0 2000kcal/j et le week-end c\u2019est no-limit (plus simple quand on voit du monde), et j\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 perdu 2kg.\nEn conclusion, l\u2019ob\u00e9sit\u00e9 c\u2019est une maladie, il y a du g\u00e9n\u00e9tique et de l\u2019environnemental. Tu vas tr\u00e8s certainement \u00e0 moyen terme reprendre tout le poids que tu vas perdre (et c\u2019est pas rare de m\u00eame reprendre plus). Je serai toi, je prendrais rdv avec un chirurgien tout de suite (plusieurs mois de d\u00e9marches compliqu\u00e9es), commencer \u00e0 te faire suivre, et commencer \u00e0 faire un peu attention en attendant. Pour le sport, \u00e0 ce stade tu risques surtout de te blesser, et dans mon cas \u00e7a me fait manger de mani\u00e8re disproportionn\u00e9e.",
                "Le conseil le plus important qui me vienne \u00e0 l\u2019esprit : concentre toi sur les sports de type cardio. Ce sont les seuls qui vont te permettre d\u2019am\u00e9liorer ton m\u00e9tabolisme (en d\u00e9veloppant tes fibres de type I) et t\u2019accompagner dans ta perte de poids.

                "Le sport, quand on est en surpoids, faut faire attention, d'un pdv articulations et cardiaque. Faut d'abord passer par l'alimentation, perdre bien, et ensuite commencer \u00e0 faire du sport r\u00e9ellement. L\u00e0 certes il faut bouger quand m\u00eame, mais tout doux. Je te conseillerais de voir un nutritionniste, il sera plus \u00e0 m\u00eame de t'aider pour tout r\u00e9\u00e9quilibrer et que \u00e7a dure dans le temps, en plus c'est un m\u00e9decin.\n\nBon courage et chapeau \u00e0 toi !",

                "Bien, tout d'abord je te f\u00e9licite que tu a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de faire quelque-chose contre l'obesit\u00e9. Je ne suis pas coach professionel ni dieticien mais comme WW a l'air de t'aider, continue cela. Retiens juste qu'un bon r\u00e9gime en est un que tu peux continer a suivre. Cela ne servira a rien si, apres avoir atteint ton poids id\u00e9al, tu recommences a bouffer n'importe comment.\n\nQuestion salle de sport, je ne peux que te dire ce que moi je fais et ce que je voudrais te conseiller: j'\u00e9tais maigrichon avant. 1m91, 65 kilos. Maintenant je pese 85 kilos et je suis relativement muscl\u00e9.\n\nDans ton cas, en premier temps, j'eviterais les trucs genre impact sur les articulations: jogging, corde a sauter, etc c'est pas ideal quand on a du surpoids. L'aviron par contre, je conseille. Ca brule des calories, c'est doux sur les articulations et c'est chouette a faire.\n\nJe suis membre Basic-Fit et perso, j'aime bien. Mais ne t'attends pas a du coaching personnel. C'est, comme le nom l'indique, assez basic. Cela dit, faut pas \u00eatre sorcier pour faire un peu de muscu, et faire de la muscu, m\u00eame si on veut perdre de la graisse, c'est conseill\u00e9. Les muscles, ca brule des calories m\u00eame sans \u00eatre utilis\u00e9 donc je te conseille le cardio, mais aussi les poids (libres).\n\nEn principe, un d\u00e9butant peut se contenter des exercices dits \"Le Grand 5\":\n\n* Bench press\n* Squat\n* Deadlift\n* Overhead press\n* Chin up\n\nMais il est conseill\u00e9 de commencer avec des poids legers. Si tu arrives a faire 3 series de 8-10 r\u00e9petitions (avec 2-3 minutes de repos entre chaque s\u00e9rie) tu peux augmenter le poids. Mais vaut mieux commencer petit, voir meme avec une barre vide, que d'y aller trop lourd et de se blesser. Je te conseille de rechercher quelques videos Youtube qui expliquent comment faire ces exercices correctement. C'est pas tres compliqu\u00e9, mais faut le faire correctement.\n\nPour le chin-up tu risques de ne pas y arriver au debut car tu es peut etre trop lourd et pas encore assez fort. N'aie crainte: il existe [une machine a chin-up assist\u00e9](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntVYkpoKRMQ) qui mets du contre-poids. Dans chaque Basic-fit que j'ai visit\u00e9, il y avait une machine pareille. Plus tu deviens fort, plus tu peux diminuer le contre-poids.\n\nEn ce qui concerne te sentir mal a l'aise parce que tu es gros et debutant: je peux t'assurer que la vaste majorit\u00e9 en a rien \u00e0 cirer. On est la pour faire nos exercises puis se casser. On s'en fout pas mal de ce que font les autres autour de nous puis on a tous \u00e9t\u00e9 debutants :-)\n\nAu contraire, je crois que la majorit\u00e9 se dira m\u00eame que c'est bien que tu d\u00e9cides de te prendre en main. Donc ne t'inquiete pas, vas-y et comme l'a dit un autre redditeur dans ce post: la regularit\u00e9, c'est la cl\u00e9. Si tu vas a la salle genre une fois tous les 36 du mois, tu n'acheveras pas grand chose ;-)",

Pas de mono pour te dire quoi faire ou si tu fais pas bien quelque-chose.\n\nJ'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 plus gros qu'aujourd'hui, BMI dans l'ob\u00e9sit\u00e9, et si j'arr\u00eate de faire de l'exercice j'y retombe, donc je pense que mon feedback pourrait en effet te concerner.\n\nDonc, avant tout, LE conseil fondamental : faire de l'exercice c'est tr\u00e8s important, mais plus encore, si ton objectif #1 est la perte de poids, c'est le volume de ce que tu bouffes qu'il te faut r\u00e9duire. Fuck le sucre, et am\u00e9liore la proportion de ci ou de \u00e7a. Le gras n'est PAS super-Satan, ce sont les carbohydrates qu'il faut le plus r\u00e9duire, et le sucre qu'il faut sucrer (j'attends mes lauriers pour le jeu de mot.)\n\nEnsuite, quoi faire en salle de muscu. R\u00e9ponse : de la cardio. Davantage de cardio. Et encore un peu de cardio pour varier. Mais comme m\u00e9rites de te sentir bien dans ta peau et de flexer tes muscles chez toi en souriant parce que tu *vois* l'am\u00e9lioration, un peu de muscu aussi.\n\nCardio : s\u00e9rieux, on n'a jamais faut mieux que le rameur. Tu es assis, tu pousses avec tes jambes, tu tires avec les bras et tu contr\u00f4les et tires avec le dos. Aucun exercice de cardio ne fait travailler autant de muscles de tant de divers endroits \u00e0 la fois, \u00e7a r\u00e9duit le risque d'\u00e9puiser une zone pr\u00e9cise en lui demandant de tout faire.   \n   Ensuite, un autre machin comme le v\u00e9lo ou le v\u00e9lo elliptique (un marcheur en fait, jamais su pourquoi on le nommait \"v\u00e9lo\" O_o).\n   Quel temps y passer: au d\u00e9but, 20 minutes, tu croiras mourir, donc c'est d\u00e9j\u00e0 bien. Rajoute cinq minutes la fois suivante, et encore cinq minutes... Id\u00e9alement, une bonne s\u00e9ance de cardio pour gros qui veut suer sa graisse (pas d'attaque perso, je connais trop bien la position), c'est au moins 50 minutes de rameur et autant de v\u00e9lo que tu supportes derri\u00e8re, allez, 30 minutes.    \n\nTon objectif, c'est l'\u00e9tat o\u00f9 tu as \u00e9puis\u00e9 toutes tes r\u00e9serves de sucres faciles \u00e0 appeler \u00e0 l'aide, et ton corps n'a plus le choix, il tape dans les r\u00e9serves durables, dans tes bourrelets de graisse, qui fondront un gramme \u00e0 la fois. Au bout de 20-30 minutes, tu vas te mettre \u00e0 suer beaucoup plus qu'avant, et en m\u00eame temps que ton corps adopte un rythme de croisi\u00e8re o\u00f9 tu as l'impression que tu peux finalement durer plus longtemps que pr\u00e9vu. C'est cet \u00e9tat-l\u00e0 que tu veux faire durer, o\u00f9 la cardio te fait le max de bien. Si tu as du bol, ton cerveau se mettra \u00e0 te doper aux endorphines et tu te sentiras super bien.    \n   Emphasis sur cette dur\u00e9e minimale, une cardio de moins de 30 minutes ne fait pas vraiment fondre tes graisses en fait.\n\nMuscu pour te sentir bien : l'id\u00e9e n'est pas de bench presser des poids comme un pro, mais de t'aider \u00e0 te sentir mieux dans ta peau, en choisissant et/ou des exercices utiles, et/ou des exercices produisant rapidement des r\u00e9sultats visibles.      \n      Exercices utiles: 3 \u00e0 5 s\u00e9ries de 20 abdos du devant, et autant d'abdos lat\u00e9raux, suivis de deux machines pour travailler les muscles du dos (je n'ai pas de noms, et ce ne sont pas toujours les m\u00eames machines dans tous les basic fit, checke la description des muscles travaill\u00e9s sur le c\u00f4t\u00e9 des machines et google le tout). Pourquoi : parce que ton corps a tellement peu l'habitude de l'exercice, que tu risques de trop solliciter des zones qui risquent de te le faire payer. Travaille le \"core\" et le dos, par pr\u00e9caution. Moins mal au dos, plus de r\u00e9sistance.   \n   Exercices aux r\u00e9sultats rapidement visibles pour te sentir mieux dans ta peau: biceps et triceps, et j'ai oubli\u00e9 leur nom, les muscles de la base des \u00e9paules. Selon la description des machines \u00e0 Basic Fit. 3 \u00e0 5 s\u00e9ries de 20 levers de poids, tu augmentes le poids d'une s\u00e9ance \u00e0 l'autre quand c'est devenu trop facile, \u00e7a doit \u00eatre dur la 1e s\u00e9rie, limite impossible la derni\u00e8re s\u00e9rie.    \n   Au bout d'un mois tu verras \u00e0 l'oeil nu tes progr\u00e8s, et \u00e7a te fera super du bien te de dire que m\u00eame si c'est cach\u00e9 sous le gras, ta cardio produit les m\u00eames r\u00e9sultats ailleurs, et si tu bosses d'autres machines de muscu, les r\u00e9sultats arriveront aussi (mais plus lentement pour l'oeil, d\u00e9sol\u00e9 \\^\\^).\n\nBasic-fit, note rapide, tu n'improvises pas ta visite. Un sac \u00e0 dos avec, en plus des habits de sport, 2 serviettes (exercices, douche), un sachet plastique pour le savon/gel douche et des sous-v\u00eatements de rechange, chaussures (de gr\u00e2ce, pas les m\u00eames shoes qu'\u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur, quoi), des oreillettes bluetooth (filaire, laisse tomber, \u00e7a bouge trop), et lors de ta premi\u00e8re visite si tu n'en as pas d\u00e9j\u00e0 tu ach\u00e8teras un petit cadenas (pense \u00e0 pr\u00e9voir qu'il te faudra un coin o\u00f9 en stocker la cl\u00e9, s'il n'est pas \u00e0 code.)\n\nBon courage gars, c'est pas facile mais \u00e7a en vaut le coup :)   \n   (Mais oublie pas, faut s'accrocher et bel et bien bouffer moins, en premier lieu)",

Pour moi la formule est simple :\n\n-\tcomme dit par beaucoup, \u00e7a passe par l\u2019alimentation. Mais la cl\u00e9 est de manger mieux, pas moins.

                "Salut.  \n\n\nJ'ai perdu 85 kg en 3 ans et demi. Je pesais 182 kg au confinement, aujourd'hui, j'en p\u00e8se environ 95-96. Parce que je crois que \u00e7a compte, je mesure 1m82. (Oui, en effet au maximum, c'est un peu cocasse, je faisais 182 kg pour 182 cm. lol, un vrai cube.)  \n\n\nBref, je n'ai pas fait une seule fois du sport \u00e0 proprement parler. J'ai juste continu\u00e9 \u00e0 vivre ma vie, juste en prenant un peu moins la bagnole, en marchant plus. J'ai juste commenc\u00e9 quelques petits exercices parce que ma peau pendouille un peu, ces derniers mois seulement.  \n\n\nPar contre j'ai arr\u00eat\u00e9 tous les aliments trop sucr\u00e9s. Le soda, out, c'est vraiment le premier truc qui m'a fait perdre. J'ai r\u00e9duit les portions de repas aussi. Par contre j'ai continu\u00e9 a manger des trucs que j'aimais, juste un peu moins. Et je me suis mis la r\u00e8gle de ne jamais me resservir.\n\nEt j'ai bien compris que m\u00eame si j'en avais envie, je ne pouvais pas me permettre de manger des aliments transform\u00e9s \u00e0 pratiquement tous les repas, parce que c'est malheureusement la dedans que se cachent pas mal d'ingr\u00e9dients de mauvaise qualit\u00e9 et/ou de trop grosses quantit\u00e9s de sucre/sel pour en cacher le go\u00fbt. Il a donc fallu cuisiner.  \n\n\nAujourd'hui je pense qu'il me sera impossible (on touche du bois, et je le dis car un \"ancien\" ob\u00e8se aura toujours cette petite peur dans le coin de la t\u00eate je suppose) que je retourne \u00e0 ces niveaux de poids, rien que parce que tout ce chemin m'a fait prendre conscience de toutes les mauvaises choses que je faisais ingurgiter \u00e0 mon corps.   \n\n\nBref, je ne te d\u00e9courage pas du tout de faire du sport, si tu en as envie, n'h\u00e9site pas, et suis les conseils de ce fil les plus pl\u00e9biscit\u00e9s, \u00e7a m'a l'air s\u00e9rieux.  \nJe voulais juste partager mon t\u00e9moignage parce que, bah, c'est un autre point de vue sur la perte de poids. Je suppose qu'il y a plein de mani\u00e8res d'en perdre. Et ma mani\u00e8re \u00e0 moi, c'est surtout d'avoir r\u00e9\u00e9quilibr\u00e9 mon alimentation (m\u00eame si je l'ai fait parfois \u00e0 l'exc\u00e8s \u00e0 certains moments, mais chacun son chemin). Je pense donc que cette id\u00e9e d'aller transpirer \u00e0 la salle pour se s\u00e9cher est surtout une construction de la culture populaire. Comme Homer qui se fait coacher par un acteur autrichien, et qui revient \u00e0 la maison 2 semaines plus tard et impressionne Marge avec son six-pack. J'ai l'orgueil de penser que la mani\u00e8re dont j'ai proc\u00e9d\u00e9 est plus durable dans le temps.  \n\n\nEn tous cas courage \u00e0 toi, l'essentiel est de pers\u00e9v\u00e9rer. A la fin tu auras pris de nouvelles habitudes et la contrainte sera pass\u00e9e, elle n'est la qu'au d\u00e9but.  \nEt le cr\u00e9dit social est assez fou.",
                "\u00c7a fait 10 ans que je vais \u00e0 la salle de sport, je suis assez sociable j'aime beaucoup tchatcher avec les gars l\u00e0 bas et je t'encourage \u00e0 faire pareil.\n\n Demande aux habitu\u00e9s de te couvrir durant les exercices un peu plus dangereux (d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 couch\u00e9, squat etc) tu peux leur demander des conseils pour bien effectuer les mouvements etc en + le lendemain quand tu les revois tu peux venir dire bonjour et tout le tralala \u00e7a fait toujours plaisir. \n\nTombe pas dans le pi\u00e8ge de blablater non-stop - fait tes exos en prio\n\nAutre point: tout le monde s'en fiche que tu fasses 70kg ou 160kg, vraiment.

C'est aussi pour \u00e7a qu'un travail et un accompagnement psy sera certainement n\u00e9cessaire.\n\nJe te souhaite \u00e9norm\u00e9ment de courage, et je pense qu'on est nombreux \u00e0 \u00eatre de tout coeur avec toi.",

Mais pour y arriver mon plus gros conseil c'est avoir de la patience avec soi m\u00eame ! Tu travailles avec ton corps et pas contre. \n\n\nChanger ses habitudes est tr\u00e8s difficile et le mieux est de le faire petit \u00e0 petit. Si tu as besoin de r\u00e9duire tes portions de nourriture, va graduellement vers la portion de nourriture id\u00e9ale pour ne pas choquer ton corps. Tu as faim dans la journ\u00e9e ? De l'eau et \u00e9ventuellement des fruits.\n\nPour le sport, se garder des jours de repos dans la semaine, et \u00e9couter son corps. Un petit peu de sport vaut mieux que pas de sport du tout, cela permet de maintenir la discipline et la motivation de faire la prochaine session de sport. Et si un jour en plein exercice tu sens que ton corps ne peut pas, tu as le droit d'arr\u00eater et de te dire que ce sera tout pour aujourd'hui.\n\nDernier conseil pour le sport, le plus dur c'est g\u00e9rer les courbatures au d\u00e9but. Les 2 premi\u00e8res semaines sont les plus difficiles parce qu'il faut continuer \u00e0 faire du sport avec des courbatures, mais il faut un peu se forcer (attention \u00e0 ne pas se faire volontairement mal non plus). Apr\u00e8s 2 semaines environ je n'avais plus ces probl\u00e8mes.\n\nEnfin dormir est tr\u00e8s important, tu br\u00fbles des calories pendant le sommeil d'o\u00f9 l'importance des 7-8h de sommeil par jour.\n\nPoint bonus sur la salle, je n'ai jamais crois\u00e9 qui que ce soit qui m'ai jug\u00e9 sur ma corpulence, au contraire les gens \u00e9taient plus \u00e0 m\u00eame de m'aider et me guider. C'est pas non plus un cercle social, mais si tu fais ton sport personne va te g\u00eaner/juger et...\n\nJ'esp\u00e8re que tu trouveras le rythme qu'il te faut avec les habitudes alimentaires qu'il te faut. Patience et discipline sont cl\u00e9s, il n'y a pas de recette miracle, le d\u00e9ficit calorique prime. Tu peux le faire, prends bien soin de toi et de ton corps !",

                "Contrairement \u00e0 ce qu'on peut penser, la salle de sport est rarement un rep\u00e8re de bullies. Les gens viennent faire leur truc et repartent chez eux. Si vraiment tu n'as pas envie d'y aller quand il y a trop de monde (ce que je peux comprendre, j'ai v\u00e9cu la m\u00eame) tu peux y aller t\u00f4t le matin, ou tard le soir. Il y a un environnement plut\u00f4t sympa \u00e0 ces heures l\u00e0, o\u00f9 personne ne jugera jamais ta performance : si tu fais parti des rares \u00e0 s'\u00eatre lev\u00e9 ce matin pour aller faire du sport, t'es d\u00e9j\u00e0 un bon!\n\nT\u00f4t le matin peut faire peur, mais c'est \u00e0 la fois grisant parce que tu d\u00e9marres la journ\u00e9e par une tr\u00e8s bonne action, tu te mets en forme d\u00e8s le matin, et en plus tu n'as plus rien \u00e0 faire le soir !

Attention toutefois \u00e0 ne pas d\u00e9sesp\u00e9rer si tu n'arrives pas \u00e0 te motiver pour y aller un matin, tu peux toujours y aller \u00e0 un autre moment.

Ce qui marche super bien pour la perte de poids c'est le tapis en marche rapide (en fonction de ton \u00e9tat physique : entre 4km/h \u00e0 5km/h) \u00e0 condition de mettre de la pente. Tu peux commencer l\u00e9ger avec 2 ou 3 degr\u00e9s, ou plus si tu pr\u00e9f\u00e8res alterner entre tapis plat et pente, l'id\u00e9e \u00e9tant d'augmenter cette pente petit \u00e0 petit. \n\nDans un premier temps, essaye de t'habituer au sport r\u00e9gulier. Dans un second temps essaye de d\u00e9passer tes limites un peu plus \u00e0 chaque fois. Augmente la pente du tapis pendant 1h30 de plusieurs degr\u00e9s. Augmente la r\u00e9sistance du v\u00e9lo pendant 1min de quelques points... La musculation va beaucoup t'aider \u00e9galement, le travail de musculation des jambes notamment permet un bien meilleur r\u00e9sultat et une plus grand facilit\u00e9 sur les machines de cardio.

Tu mangeras par faim, et plus pour \u00eatre \"rempli\", ce qui peut participer \u00e0 te donner une meilleure habitude alimentaire  \n\\- Tu te sentira mieux dans ton corps et surtout dans ta t\u00eate, plus en forme pour justement commencer \u00e0 surveiller ton alimentation de plus pr\u00eat, plus serein pour tenir sur la distance.    \n\\- Apr\u00e8s le sport, tu n'as vraiment, vraiment pas envie de te saborder et annihiler tous tes efforts avec de la malbouffe.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBon courage et amuse toi bien !

Supprime l'alcool. Fais le m\u00e9nage dans tes placards pour d\u00e9gager ces trucs. S'ils ne sont pas chez toi, tu ne vas pas les manger.\n\nTertio :  marche, marche, marche, tant que tu peux. Va au boulot en marchant. l\u00e8ve toi t\u00f4t le samedi et le dimanche et va marcher dans un parc (d'abord 20' et au fur et \u00e0 mesure, augmente jusqu'\u00e0 trois heures)....D\u00e9j\u00e0, tu vas mieux dormir, ensuite ton app\u00e9tit va se r\u00e9guler \u00e0 la baisse, et pour finir tu vas perdre du poids lentement mais surement, et celui-l\u00e0 tu auras du mal \u00e0 le reprendre. Et la marche, c'est facile et tu ne peux pas y \u00e9chapper....alors que dans la salle, entre le type qui va tailler la bavette, la difficult\u00e9 de faire effort pour garder sa motivation, les regards en biais faussement sympa, passer par les vestiaires \u00e0 l'entr\u00e9e et \u00e0 la sortie, les heures d'affluence o\u00f9 \u00e7a pue la sueur,etc.....bof....\n\nUne fois que t'es descendu \u00e0 un physique acceptable, va \u00e0 la salle pour faire du muscle si tu veux. Pour l'instant, tu peux largement t'en passer. Tu peux faire mieux et gratuit, simplement en  marchant. En sus, si tu veux te former ou t'informer, tu peux t'enregistrer des podcasts \u00e0 \u00e9couter pendant tes s\u00e9ances de marche.\n\nUne anecdote : Les parisiens n'ont jamais autant perdu de poids que pendant les gr\u00e8ves de m\u00e9tro.

Course ( mais tu risques de te faire mal aux ligaments avec ta corpulence actualle) , plutot v\u00e9lo, ski de fond, marche, ( sur une dur\u00e9e significative ), natation ou juste faire plouf a un endroit ou ta pas pied ( ca c'est le top ) enfin ce genre de trucs. La salle c'est peut etre cool si ils ont des eliptiques ou ce genre de trucs. \n\nRappelle toi un truc basique.  1h de course realivement intense c'est 650kcal. Parreil pour la natation ou 1h30 de velo intense. C'est dur. \n\nPour reference un bigmac (sandwich seul) c'est 540 kcal. Plus ou moins equivalent a ton heure de course intense. Quand tu comprends ca, le calcul est vite fait.\n\nJe pense que ton meilleur paris pour perdre du poid, c'est surtout de moins manger. Il faut faire un peu de sport (l\u00e9ger, sinon tu va souffrir et t'es pas la pour ca) pour stimuler ton corps de mani\u00e8re r\u00e9guli\u00e8re. Il faut mieux aller marcher un peu chaque jour plutot que de faire 1 session violente ou 2 par semaine.\n\nEt ensuite il faut surtout modifier compl\u00e9tement ton alimentation. Diminuer les quantit\u00e9s de tout ce que tu manges et trouver des paliatifs quand ta faim. ( moi je bois du th\u00e9,  ca remplis ton ventre et te donne le sentiment de satsi\u00e9t\u00e9 si tu en bois tout au long de ta journ\u00e9e, mais a chacun de trouver son truc.) \nPour la quantit\u00e9 et ce que tu dois manger,  je dois avouer ne rien y connaitre.

MAIS le meilleur conseil que je puisse te donner c\u2019est d\u2019arr\u00eater alcool et boissons gazeuses.\n\nEnfin (vrai dernier conseil) : le poid ne veut rien dire, tu peux faire 100kg et \u00eatre muscl\u00e9 comme 80 et \u00eatre flasque / gros.

                "Herendi Porcelain Manufactory will once again produce the shattered victory trophy of Hungarian Grand Prix winner Max Verstappen, the company's CEO announced in the studio of M4 Sport.\n\nThe victory trophy was damaged during the prize-giving ceremony, when second-placed Lando Norris, in his traditional celebratory gesture, slammed his champagne bottle against the podium, opening it.\n\nHe did the same thing two weeks ago at Silverstone, knocking over a trophy, but at the Hungarian Grand Prix he caused serious damage with his special method, as the winner Max Verstappen's trophy fell and broke into several pieces.\n\n\"It is with great regret that we learned yesterday that the beautiful Herendi trophy, a handmade work of art, was damaged. It is the result of almost six months of work by more than 30 people and we were very sorry to see this happen to our artwork. But we believe, and Herendi Porcelain Manufactory is a company that plays a key role in building the country's image, that we will replace the trophy for the first place winner, and while the teams decide who was at fault and who was not, we will take on the joyful and heavy burden of this\", said Attila Simon, CEO of Herendi Porcelain Manufactory Zrt.\n\nSimon emphasised that all their creations are guaranteed to be replaced in perpetuity, which is why the sample collection also includes a duplicate of the Hungarian Grand Prix trophies. Production of the bodywork has already begun, so the original six-month production process will now be shortened and the two-time world champion Red Bull will receive the trophy in a few weeks.\n\nTranslated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version)",

How many times has time stopped for a magical move by Neymar, and how many thrills have I felt every time Verratti came out of the press like nothing. The history of football is made up of great teams that lose. This team was great at some time, but it had become sad. I'm upset to see them go, but the reality is that it was no longer viable, it was no longer beautiful, this team had become hard to follow.

It's time to move on, but thank you Neymar, thank you Verratti. The little prince of the Parc will always be at home in Paris.",

Recherche oblige, mes camarades de labos et moi sommes\u2026 s\u00e9dentaires (9-19 heures dans un bureau au sous-sol et j\u2019ai 10 minutes de marche pour aller au bureau). Et bon, m\u00eame si j\u2019essaie au maximum de manger sain et de faire 10k pas par jours, on retombe tous dans le grignotage devant l\u2019ordinateur \u00e0 minuit et demi quand les r\u00e9sultats de nos exp\u00e9riences sont foireuses, ou que le rapport qu\u2019on a \u00e9crit est renvoy\u00e9 pour la sixi\u00e8me fois parce que notre superviseur trouvent nos graphes pourris.\n\nBref vivre sainement c\u2019est compliqu\u00e9, et ma condition physique n\u2019est franchement pas terrible. Je fais 1m69 (rendez-moi mon dernier centim\u00e8tre !!) pour 71kg ce qui fais de moi une personne un peu chubby comme disent les Anglais, ou un peu enrob\u00e9e selon Ob\u00e9lix. Je me suis donc mise au d\u00e9fi, avec les 6 autres membres de mon laboratoire de recherche de participer \u00e0 un 5k inflatable run (course gonflable cela fait moins classe quand m\u00eame) un peu \u00e0 la Mud run \u2013 une course avec des obstacles divers qui font bien monter le rythme cardiaque en montant des structures gonflables en tout genre et les moments de repos sont la course jusqu\u2019au prochain obstacle \u2013 mais moins salissant. Donc pour le 14 octobre, il faut que j\u2019arrive \u00e0 courir 5k en 30 minutes. Cela ne va pas \u00eatre la tarte parce que je suis la fille qui ressemble \u00e0 un croisement entre une loutre asthmatique et une tomate bien mure d\u00e8s qu\u2019il faut faire un effort physique un peu soutenu. Mais voil\u00e0, pour la premi\u00e8re fois de ma vie, je suis motiv\u00e9e \u00e0 faire du sport, avec un objectif r\u00e9alisable et une m\u00e9daille \u00e0 la cl\u00e9.\n\nJ\u2019\u00e9cris ce poste apr\u00e8s \u00eatre rentr\u00e9e de mon premier entrainement de ces deux mois. J\u2019utilise une application anglaise s\u2019appelant couch to 5k : du canap\u00e9 aux 5 kilom\u00e8tres ; c\u2019est une initiative de la BBC qui a pour objectif de te faire courir 5k en trente minutes apr\u00e8s neuf semaines d\u2019entrainement.

J'ai d\u00fb m'y r\u00e9soudre quand j'ai repris un poste 100% bureau il y a quelques ann\u00e9es.\n- fais gaffe, une course \u00e0 obstacle \u00e7a va \u00eatre bien plus dur qu'un 5km tranquille autour d'un lac, au niveau effort et rythme. Garde \u00e7a en t\u00eate. Par contre t'auras la motivation du truc et tu vas te surpasser ce jour l\u00e0, et te dire \"ha je sais faire \u00e7a ? Ha bon.\"\n- pour les obstacles \u00e0 grimper va falloir du muscle. Essaie de faire quelques (le plus que tu peux hein) pompes et quelques squats si c'est pas inclus dans tes entra\u00eenements.\n\nDans tous les cas bravo pour te lancer l\u00e0 dedans.

A titre d'exemple pour mes 31 ans, mes 5 zones sont les suivantes :\nZone 1 Echauffement : 96-114 bpm\nZone 2 Facile : 115-133 bpm \nZone 3 a\u00e9robie : 134-153 bpm\nZone 4 seuil : 154-172 bpm\nZone 5 maximum : 172 - limite de ton c\u0153ur\n\nAvant je ne r\u00e9fl\u00e9chissais pas et tout le long du run j'\u00e9tais directement dans la zone 4 voire 5 et mon corps me l\u00e2chait rapidement.\nSi tu ne vises aucune performance alors je te conseille vivement pendant ton run de rester en zone 2 et 3.

Si je peux donner un conseil c'est d'essayer de courir dans des endroits \"mous\" (for\u00eat c'est bien mais attention aux racines) pendant ton entrainement parce que vu ton gabarit et ton pass\u00e9 sportif \u00e7a peut vite \u00eatre traumatisant pour tes articulations. Le b\u00e9ton c'est pas ouf m\u00eame si c'est la surface sur laquelle tu courras le plus vite, c'est bien de pas trop en faire, id\u00e9alement faut varier le plus possible les terrains et h\u00e9site pas \u00e0 courir sur l'herbe au lieu du trottoir (c'est pas pour rien qu'on voit souvent des personnes \u00e2g\u00e9es le faire). Je dis \u00e7a parce que 5kms en 30 minutes \u00e7a me para\u00eet assez ambitieux (sans vouloir d\u00e9courager, c'est important des objectifs qui challenge un peu) quand m\u00eame et donc peut \u00eatre un peu brutal pour un d\u00e9but mais tant que t'y prends du plaisir je suppose qu'il y a pas lieu de s'inqui\u00e9ter, juste bien faire la diff\u00e9rence entre courbatures et douleurs (t'auras toujours des petites douleurs mais si \u00e7a empire l\u00e0 faut changer quelque chose) Bonne chance et on esp\u00e8re des mises \u00e0 jour positives !",

                "Savoir courir 5km, si tu t'y mets maintenant, \u00e9tant jeune, tu y arriveras sans souci particulier. Commence \u00e0 petit rythme (au dessus de 6min/km si il faut) 2,3 fois par semaine, jusqu'\u00e0 ce que tu sois fatigu\u00e9e, quite \u00e0 revenir en marchant, c'est pas grave. Si tu arrives d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e0 faire 3 km \u00e0 5:30 d'ici fin aout, fin septembre, les 5km sont dans la poche.\n\nPar contre, oui, pense \u00e0 te muscler un peu le haut du corps, si il y a des obstacles, \u00e7a peut servir.",
                "Courir 5k en 30 minutes, sans obstacle, c'est un bel exploit qui prend plusieurs semaines voire plusieurs mois \u00e0 quelqu'un de sportif qui se met \u00e0 la course \u00e0 pieds en partant de z\u00e9ro. Vu la description que tu fais, c'est un objectif extr\u00eamement ambitieux, encore plus sur une course d'obstacles. Peut-\u00eatre relever un peu la barre ? Rien que parvenir \u00e0 courir 5k, sans pause ni interruption (marche), c'est d\u00e9ja un objectif plus r\u00e9aliste et un bel accomplissement.",

Il me semble que la moyenne de vitesse de marche d'un humain normal est de 5km/ h donc arriver \u00e0 10 km/ h c''est pas le P\u00e9rou, encore plus si tu suis un programme serieux.\nEt sois constante: un peu de course ou alors 1/2 h de marche par jour tous les jours.

I\u2019ve ridden from Oregon to Guatemala on a KLR, and while it was comfortable, it was too heavy, and surprisingly not a lot of Kawasaki dealerships in Mexico / Latin America. \n\nPriorities are simplicity, parts availability / affordability, and balanced on-off road capability. \n\nAlso, what would someone guess is a good amount to budget for a trip like this? On my 6 month Mexico journey I probably spent about $40 a day. So if I planned for this trip to take about 2 years, that would come out to around $30,000. Plus shipping, unexpected costs, etc, maybe another $5K? I\u2019m shooting from the hip here. \n\nAny advice / resources are well appreciated. Thanks!",

Royal Enfield has a decent network and adoption in South America as well and I met several people on them who all seemed like happy campers. BMW is reliable but *IF* something goes wrong it will be expensive and time consuming to fix. KTM, well... I met people using KTMs for similar trips but you have to really enjoy working on your bike yourself lol (and waiting for parts).\n\nIf you're taking 2 years to do it, I assume you'll be venturing far from that red line you drew.

Many long and very hard miles on a bike with luggage on the back could end up with a broken subframe. Not a big chance, but a very big problem if it does happen as it\u2019s not something fixable roadside with duct tape, zip ties, and a tool set.",

I own a KLR650 that I built for wild camping and adv around europe, but I'd never take that on a \"real\" globe ride. It's way too unweildy and heavy. \n\nA ride like this needs a bike you can pick up all day, every day, while up to your ankles in the mud, without unloading your gear. You won't need the top speed of a 650 (or even larger), because you (hopefully) won't be riding higways and A-roads. You won't need the power of a big bike, as you will only be able to get a fraction of it to the ground off the tarmac.     \nWith all this considered, probably something in the 300-450cc range. \n\nFor me personally, an engine I can field strip and rebuild at a rural gas station would be important. No fuel injection, no electronic ignition, no unnecessary body control modules, probably no ABS either. All these things can break in ways I can't easily diagnose and repair in the wild, so they need to not be there. I'd also want a kick start, if only as a fallback. \n\nThe bike should be built for the trip aswell. An in-depth mechanical service is part of it, a purpose-built luggage reciever for your kit is another. While servicing the bike, write down all the tools you need to get rasonably well into it, then put together a toolkit containing the smallest verwion of all these tools. Take the bike out on a few trips, multi-day with your prefered mode of accomodation over night, to see if what works and what doesn't. \n\nMy personal choice for a rtw baseline would probably be something  like an 80s or 90s DR400. Realistically, pretty much every bike *can* make a trip like these, it's mostly about giving *yourself* the best chances of succeeding with it.",

Harry on the other hand also was staying and ten hag happy to do so but again I\u2019ll rather sell him for 30-35+ anything.

The signing of the French central defender is a priority for the English management in the event of the departure of [**Harry Maguire**](https://rmcsport.bfmtv.com/football/premier-league/manchester-united-onana-se-justifie-et-assume-son-gros-coup-de-gueule-contre-maguire_AV-202308010301.html) this summer. Manchester has approached the entourage of the 23-year-old Frenchman with whom the discussions are considered constructive according to information from RMC Sport.\n\nThe Red Devils are still hoping for a Harry Maguire sale. Arrived in 2019 for a then record price of around 87 million euros, the 30-year-old Englishman is no longer in Erik ten Hag's plans in Manchester and West Ham has positioned itself to attract him. His designated successor appears to be Todibo, despite **recent interest from Juventus** .\n\n## Todibo not untransferable\n\nOn the Nice side, **Florent Ghisolfi** opened the door to a transfer from Jean-Clair Todibo. The C\u00f4te d'Azur sports director confirmed at the end of July that the international Espoirs defender was not untransferable this summer if the club was there.\n\n\"If all the parties can find themselves in a transfer, it can be done, assured the leader of the Aiglons about Jean-Clair Todibo and Kh\u00e9phren Thuram. But today, we want to keep them. In addition, we are in presence of two players and entourages very well in Nice and very respectful of the institution, which is increasingly strong and respected by the other clubs. If we can keep them, we will keep them.\"\n\n## Todibo a framework in Nice, a solution for the future at the Blues\n\nTrained in Toulouse then left to try his luck at FC Barcelona, \u200b\u200bJean-Clair Todibo has since gained experience at Schalke 04 and Benfica Lisbon. Arrived in Nice in 2021, the central quickly became essential there. Taulier of the three-man defense with Dante, the Frenchman remains on two big seasons with the Riviera club where **Christophe Galtier** , Lucien Favre and Didier Digard have made him an indisputable holder. In 2022-2023, the 23-year-old defender played 46 games in all competitions with OGC Nice.\n\nA sure bet in Ligue 1, **Jean-Clair Todibo** even discovered the France team during the month of March. If the Nice defender did not come into play against the Netherlands and Ireland, he convinced Didier Deschamps to select him from the Blues and summon him to Clairefontaine. An arrival in the Premier League would only underline his rise to power. This would allow it to change dimension in the short term.\n\nCASE :\n\n## RMC Sport exclusive information\n\n[https://rmcsport.bfmtv.com/football/transferts/mercato-manchester-united-cible-le-nicois-todibo\\_AV-202308080371.html](https://rmcsport.bfmtv.com/football/transferts/mercato-manchester-united-cible-le-nicois-todibo_AV-202308080371.html)",

Motorsports are absolutely sports, and the drivers are thletes who risk their lives. That being said, I'm not really understanding why Formula 1 is considered to be the \"pinnacle of motorsports\".  I tried watching it and didn't get the hype, and I think the biggest reason why I didnt enjoy it was  an  uneven playing field.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSports are meant to be equal, with the compeition at hand being used to deceide the better team/athlete. The fact that Formula 1 is  significantly unequal, unlike any other sport on earth, defeats the sense of it being a true competition, and thus, the stakes are lowered. A lot of a driver's success is contingent upon the car they're using. Even F1 fans admit that it's more of an 'engineering\" competition as opposed to a drivers' competition. But even if you look at it as an engineering competition, it's unfair too considering the spending and money disaprity among teams.  This is why we're only seeing Red Bull and Mercedes dominating. Do you really think Verstappen and Hamilton could dominate in a Haas, Alfa Romeo, or Williams? Additionally, this creates a race that features very little overtaking or action in the relevent places, thus making it a bore to watch (at least to me).  Why would anyone want to watch a race that features little overtaking and action? F1 is never really framed as an engineering competition in its official marketing- the drivers championship is always emphasized.\n\nAdditionally, I think F1 is too focused with the idea of \"glitz and glamor\", as well as f1 being a brand first and motorsport league second. Sean Bratches, a former executvie of Liberty Media, a comapny which owns Formula One Group, said regarding f1, \"We're trying to pivot Formula One from a motorsport company to a media and entertainment brand. \" Does that sound like leadership that is passionate about motorsport? With this kind of attitude, you're not going to see true racing fans are races- you're going to see obnoxious clout-chasing influencers. Is that the culture you want in motorsports?",

This is why we're only seeing Red Bull and Mercedes dominating.\n\nI want to change your view on this specific point even though I agree that more competition would improve the sport. \n\nF1 implemented a spending cap recently to specifically address the ability for teams to buy wins. \n\nhttps://www.autosport.com/f1/news/formula-1-cost-cap-what-is-it-and-how-does-it-work/10379447/",
                "> Sports are meant to be equal, with the compeition at hand being used to deceide the better team/athlete.  \n\nSports are meant to be \"equal\".  \nIn every sport, competitors are exploiting anything they can to get the best performance, and the best results, whilst staying within the rules.  \n\nF1 is exactly the same, and there is a huge number of rules regulating what teams can do with the cars.  \nSure, the teams that spend more tend to do better, but a big part of Formula 1 is pushing the engineering side of motorsport, and you can't do that if you put massive limits on spending.  \n\nHowever, F1 has now implemented a spending cap to try to level the playing field for teams.  \nCompared to pretty much every team sport I can think of, thats already a big positive.  \n\nFootball is the most popular sport in the world, and teams spend tens of millions getting the best players, coaches, managers, physios etc.  \n\n&nbsp;  \n\n> Do you really think Verstappen and Hamilton could dominate in a Haas, Alfa Romeo, or Williams?\n\nThe reason these drivers are in the best cars, is because they are the best drivers.  \nSure, put Verstappen/Hamilton in the worst car on the grid, and they probably aren't going to dominate, but they would probably make the car look a lot better than it is.  \n\nYoung, talented drivers are regularly picked up from \"worse\" teams. Just because they aren't winning in a Williams doesn't mean their talent won't shine through, you just have to look at George Russell for a recent example.  \n\nAgain, football is the most popular sport in the world, but even Messi isn't going to carry the worst team in the premier league to victory.",
                "I've been an F1 fan since around 2010, to be honest most seasons usually have one person dominating. The only seasons I can recall since I started watching that had an actual championship fight were 2010, 2012, 2016 (Just between Merc), and 2021. That's just how this sport works. It's been particularly bad this year, but I like to just look at it from a historical perspective. People don't talk about how \"bad\" F1 was in 1988 when McClaren won nearly every race or the 2000s when Ferrari and Schumacher won everything. We are currently watching history be made in this sport. The true enjoyment in watching F1 is following the storylines of drivers in the midfield. New rookies, their careers. Who is the next Max Verstappen? The fastest drivers end up in the fastest cars, is the argument you'll hear a lot about drivers dominating with the best car.\n\n\"Pinnacle of motorsports\" is really just a catch phrase. Most of us recognize that there are fantastic drivers of equal level all across the world everywhere from Rally to Indycar. It's referred to as the pinnacle because F1 drivers are probably the most famous and highly paid, so for many drivers it's their ultimate goal, especially if they race open wheel. They're also the fastest race series in the world, if you care about that. \n\nThere are other motorsports where people are in equal machinery. And they can be great. Even F2 and F3 are like that. But constructors being able to manufacture their own cars is part of the soul of F1 and that will never change. But also for me there is something missing. I don't enjoy spec series, because I love the engineering side of the sport that really only  F1 has.\n\nBudget cap addresses your concerns about spending, more or less. In fact it's made the competition arguably worse, because when one team nails the regulations (Red Bull) nobody else can dump money into catching up to them.\n\nYour concerns about liberty media are valid and I'm not going to argue with them. I do think the current \"spike\" in F1 popularity from DTS will ultimately lead to a degradation of the sport, but at some point that will fall apart and it'll revitalize itself. I don't think F1 will go away anytime soon.\n\nA bit of a ramble but to your original argument of \"overrated\", that's totally subjective. Are people ranting and raving about it and you just don't see the hype? Fair. But there are a ton of F1 fans that love a lot about this sport, even during the slow seasons. Even if I know Max is going to win in Spa I show up to see the other stories. Can Max set a new race streak record for the ages? Will Lewis win again before he retires? Same for Alonso? Will Danny Ric perform well and threaten Checo's seat at RB next season? Will Piastri be able to get a podium or even a win as a rookie? Is Alpine going to continue to fall apart? There's so much going on beyond just who wins the race.",

The problem is not actually the F1, it's the FIA that needs to calm down with the strict regulations. Back then, if you painted all cars in black, you could still distinguish one model from another, today, it's almost impossible! \n\nBut still, we must highlight something here, without the F1, lots of everyday features would not exist.

                "I think overall, when you examine other sports, F1 isn't necessarily a standout when it comes to a lack of competition and focus. It's just that you're seeing the negatives on the surface, whereas other sports may hide them a bit more\n\n> Sports are meant to be equal\n\nFirst off, I agree, sports are meant to be equal. However, a lot of popular sports *leagues* are entertainment first, competition second. We, the viewer, love to see top athletes compete at a regulated game. Owners and the leagues, love to see the dollar signs that come from that. \n\nIn this sense, a lot of teams are *not* competing on equal terms due to their owners willingness to spend money. Teams within a league are simply not competing because they do not want to, creating a sense of unequal competition.\n\nLet's look at the MLB and stick with money. Some teams spend ~$60-$70 million, while others field rosters of $350m, and it's generally about whether or not the owner is willing to fork over the cash. Doesn't that seem unfair though? Some teams have far fewer options to be competitive than the others, just because their owners are willing to spend more or less.\n\nThis is applicable to other sports as well, though not as extreme due to the MLBs lack of a salary floor. Some NBA owners are willing to pay luxury tax to make a good team, whereas other teams are happy to keep collecting their share of the revenue. Let's not even get into European Football and how contracts and spending work there.\n\nEach team in a league is generally not working on equal footing financially, giving some teams more flexibility than others. Isn't that the same as F1 teams choosing to spend more or less on their cars and engineering?\n\n> \"We're trying to pivot Formula One from a motorsport company to a media and entertainment brand. \" Does that sound like leadership that is passionate about motorsport?\n\nSecond and similarly, many teams in some leagues *aren't* trying to be competitive. While some owners may not outright say \"we aren't competing\", some aim to play the cheapest possible roster and rake in the dough of owning a sports team. Teams like the Rays and aforementioned As roll out cheap teams and could care less whether they're competitive or not.\n\nFinally, consider how divisions and conferences work in some leagues. In the MLB, you get a playoff spot for winning your division, and yet divisions are by no means equal competitively; The last place Yankees would be first in the Al Central and play more of their games against strong teams in the AL East. The same can be said of the NFL.\n\nSome teams are making it to the playoffs and getting a chance at a ring over better teams, simply because they're competition is easier (which as we discussed above, may be due to teams not trying). Some playoffs formats aren't designed to get the best teams to face off, but to get the ones in the best situations",
                "What do you mean by overrated? Many people enjoy watching it, so it generates a lot of news and ads; and, those ads are perfectly correlated with the sports popularity due to market forces. \n\nWhat if it is a sport more about engineering? \n\nI think your claim is skewed, because it seems you are arguing that people dont understand Formula 1, AND its overrated. \n\nId agree with you that much of its popularity comes from blind brand recognition and basic enjoyment of sights and sounds, *like most sports.*\n\nSports arent about logic. They are about being tribal and rooting for a side based essentially on faith. That faith binds people together and makes something exciting. \n\nYour criticisms of Formula 1 as a motorsport seem fair, but that doesnt make it overrated in the market, and people\u2019s misperception of driver skill doesn mean that they shouldnt root for the driver. \n\nSports are about stories and tribes, based on, yes, a \u201cfair\u201d competition. But look at basketball for a quite obvious example of that \u201cfairness\u201d coming into question. \n\nSports are fundamentally primal, not logical.

                "While I agree in general with many, many, MANY of the points you make, and this comes after decades of motorsports fandom, here are some counterpoints.\n\n1) Formula 1 is not a sport. Motorsports are a sport. Formula 1 might not be your category, but the good news is that there are A LOT of motorsports out there. \n\nIf you want to like F1, but want more competition, check out IndyCar. It's the same style of car, but put in more tricky situations. The schedule contains road courses, similar to F1, temporary street circuits, which are absolutely raw compared to F1, and ovals, which feature the fastest circuit racing on Earth every year.\n\nIf you want a bit more fender-banging and racecraft, check the Aussie SuperCars.\n\nIf you like the European circuits and vibe, check out WEC.\n\nSuper Formula, IMSA, Formula e, NASCAR, Moto GP, WRC... there's a lot going on out there!\n\nFormula 1 is not the only category of motorsport, and like you said, it's not the pinnacle as it advertises.\n\n2) While I agree that the marketing is off, both in terms of not featuring the engineering, and the outright lie that it's the \"pinnacle of motorsports\", that doesn't dismiss two facts: 1) It is the highest level of racing engineering in the world (most of the time) and 2) it is the destination-of-choice for drivers because of the high salary amounts, and lack-of-danger faced in other categories. As such, the drivers that are there are guaranteed to be at a minimum competent.\n\n3) I think a lot of the misunderstanding comes from the success of Drive to Survive. That show has portrayed a less-than-accurate view of the racing action and what goes on in real life. F1 has always had its euro-elitism up front, but it always felt like most fans knew what it was, other than some euro-supremacist types. \n\nWith DTS, it painted a picture of F1 looking like a knock down, drag out driver's fight race in and race out. It made F1's on-track action look like IndyCar's. And in 2021, it somewhat was that. Which lead to even more false expectations from the new crowd.\n\nAnd it's that crowd that's really hyping it up. I have always been a diehard racing fan. I grew up a hardcore CART fan. Friends I had for years who never cared about racing, suddenly are talking to me about how great F1 is. Because of that show.\n\nConclusion: You're right, F1 is overrated. But you're wrong that it's not competitive, or a sport, or not worth your time. Take it on its actual terms. And go watch some other stuff too!",
                "Formula 1 is not just a driver's sport. It is also an engineering sport. The championship is about who can come up with the best combination of car, driver, strategy and execution.\n\nAll teams have differing cars and sometimes even the same team has both cars set up differently. Each driver has a different driving style. And yet, on a majority of tracks, most cars are within 1 second.\n\nTeams are unequal but in the same way as any other sport. The big teams are able to attract the best drivers and the best engineers because that is where they can show their talent the best and earn big money. Why would Verstappen or Newey want to be in Haas instead of Red Bull? It's the same way as Pep Guardiola or Haaland choosing Manchester City.\n\nHowever , despite the disparity, the teams don't stay where they are. They keep rising and falling. If you look at 2020, Mercedes had a car as strong as any and were far ahead of the field. Behind them, Verstappen maximized his results and finished just 9 points behind Bottas despite being in an inferior car. His teammate Albon on the other hand was much behind. Similarly, Racing Point could not keep up with Red Bull despite having the Pink Mercedes. But then what happens in 2021 - Red Bull come up with a  car that can match Mercedes and we get the best championship fight in recent history, Racing Point rebadge as Aston Martin and turn into backmarkers and Ferrari turn into a strong team again after a dismal 2020. In 2022, with the new regulations, Red Bull and Ferrari turn out to be the strongest teams but Ferrari are unable to strategize and execute well and they fall behind. McLaren and Aston Martin meanwhile are nowhere. At the start of this year, Aston Martin make a big jump and are able to compete with Mercedes and Ferrari but in the mid season development, they make bad decisions and fall behind while McLaren come up with an update that makes them equal to Mercedes and Ferrari.\n\nHowever, the engineering and strategy part of the sport is hard to market since it is not something that many people can comprehend. Also, it is a big group of people in an engineering team while a single driver is easier to glamorize and put on a pedestal. As for the brand first and sport second, unfortunately almost all sports are moving in that direction. Most of the EPL clubs have owners who only care about the profits and not the sport. It's just a bit worse with Liberty media for two reasons. One is that \"cars go vroom\" is already bringing in a lot of glitz and the other reason being that Liberty Media panders to the big money that comes from the US and the Middle East and both these places have more interest in the show than the sport, but that is for most sports in these places",
                "Every sport has teams that are able to spend more and therefore dominate. At least in F1 a big factor of the ability to spend more is recent past success, not just what market you happen to be in. The LA Lakers will always have more financial resources than the Utah Jazz, regardless of how well the Jazz do. The dynasty teams in other sports are those with the biggest markets.  In F1, any given year any given team could come up with the right combo of engineering and driver. Witness Brawn in 2009. And everybody thought Hamilton was crazy for jumping from McLaren to Mercedes, but that brought in era of Mercedes Dominance. \n\nIt\u2019s not just an engineering competition. If it was, you\u2019d see much more competition between Verstappen and Perez. Or Hamilton and Bottas when Hamilton was dominant. It\u2019s truly a team sport where a lot of pieces have to come together to produce a winning team. Strategy and execution got Ferrari last year, even though they may have had a good enough car and driver to challenge Red Bull, at least early in the year. And yes, it\u2019s quite possible that Max or Lewis in a Haas could challenge for a championship both because they are clearly elite drivers, and because as such, they could help the engineers develop a car suited for them and they\u2019d have the clout to shake up the personnel in those team if necessary. Obviously, if a team doesn\u2019t have good enough engineering and strategy/execution talent, they are going to suffer even with a good driver, but a great driver and a great engineering team complement each other.\n\nF1 is exciting to follow over the years, seeing how technology and the teams adapt, gain prominence, and lose prominence. Watching drivers come into the sport, and seeing when the right driver lands with the right team and magic is made. And when that happens, even though on any given race weekend, or even a season, it may not be nail-biting exciting as to outcome at the top, it\u2019s fun to enjoy the magic of a rare elite driver in a rare elite car in a team that is executing amazingly. \n\nPlus, it\u2019s superficial to only care about who wins and write off a whole sport due to it. Watching what teams are improving, or not, and what drivers are out performing their cars is very exciting. Much more so than, say, the contrived restrictor plate racing that turned NASCAR into WWF.\n\nF1 is the pinnacle of motorsport because of the shear performance involved. No other cars can accelerate, brake, and corner as fast. They are truly at the limits of what a human driver can endure, especially the braking forces and lateral forces in some turns. And the cars are on the absolute limit of breaking loose much of the time. It\u2019s actually pretty impressive that a driver like Alex Albon can do as well as he does in a car that has the worst aerodynamics. There\u2019s so much to pay attention to every race and every season that writing it off because right now Max and Red Bull are being amazing is pretty silly.\n\nAnd, court side of every Lakers game, and sky boxes of every Rams game has just as many, if not more, glitz and glamor folks there just to be seen and not follow the sport as any F1 race.",
                "Why do you need your view changed? People like different sports who cares?",
                "Sports are not meant to be equal. The entire premise of sport is that there are inequalities amongst participants resulting in winners and losers. \n\nThink about whatever sport you enjoy watching. Now think about the best team in that league facing off against the worst team. There are going to be very clear inequalities which could be driven by financial resources like Red Bull and Mercedes or by talent of the individual like Max Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton. To address your argument, if you put Max Verstappen in a Haas, he\u2019s not going to have the same results, but to the same argument, if you put Latifi in a Red Bull, he\u2019ll still finish 21st. Max this year has repeatedly shown that he\u2019s a much more talented driver than teammate Sergio Perez and consistently outperforms him week over week. \n\nAnd yes, the entire of premise is an overblown science experiment for automotive manufacturers that the FIA has turned into a revenue generating sport. No one is doubting that. Things like active suspension, paddle shifting, carbon fibre and active power train were all first demonstrated in F1 before making it to consumer vehicles. There\u2019s a reason the Constructors Cup exists. And because of that, it costs a damn lot of money to fund. \n\nF1 certainly has its faults but I don\u2019t see how it\u2019s more \u201coverrated\u201d than any other major sport in the world.",

Mercedes dominance has been broken and it\u2019s nice seeing Lewis racing hard and taking points.  Mclarens story this season has been a rollercoaster but seeing piastri leading the sprint as a rookie was exciting.  \n\nI\u2019d argue sister teams hold the sport back more.  Alpha tauri being the Red Bull reserve team you know won\u2019t beat Red Bull in the constructors\u2026ever.  Meanwhile other teams are asked to pay hundreds of millions to join.\n\nWhat is happening in f1 right now is the combination of an incredible engineer for red bull and a record breaking driver in Verstappen.  Checo is in the same car but barely has been competitive barring todays race.\n\nI could go on and on if you want to know more.  At the end of the day F1 is a team sport.

If people were half as interested in their own lives and skills the world would be significantly more interesting. I would rather a grandma tell me why and how she knits than a man tell me why he is obsessed with another man, hearing a gay man talk about his love interest would also be way more interesting. Sports and other competitive games are just outlets for the inherent tribalness of humanity, to me seeing them play out is a kin to watching animals fight but they aren't allowed to actually tear each other throats out, so like a nature documentary but way less interesting. I personally despise people who get obsessed with people centric things it makes no sense to me and it bores the f%ck out of me to hear them run their mouths about nothing for hours on end. I do think that I am weird for that but so many people are just so flat in terms of personality and it feels like they just get flatter as they find their \"people\" (aka a group to assimilate to washing over all that makes you unique). Talking to people has become routine and uninspired, I can tell what cloth a person is cut from in general and Its the same cheapo blend of threads that everyone else is cause being your own person is just too much to ask in this day and age. \n\nI dislike things that homogenize people as well as the people who are homogenized, you can be what ever you you like, and I certainly don't have a say, but the advent of internet and hyperconnectedness has made the flavors of people to choose from small and the good flavors don't really stay their own flavor. They often dilute and become more of the same at a gradual but steady pace. \n\nSometimes it feels like people fall into a mold of what they think it is to be human without really thinking that much, and at the end of their journey they become this individual that is more a result of copying others than internalizing experiences through their own lens. They become as a cliche rather than an individual that they can call their own.",

It will take longer to reach the full potential for performance but at least its possible for lower teams, they will just take longer to catch up.\n\nAs for the glitz and glamour angle. Yes that's a bit annoying, but I imagine the teams already run at a loss right, they spend a ton of money on this so I'm guessing they need the sport to reach as many people as possible to widen the available market. Pivoting it into more of an event than a sport is a good move from that perspective. \n\nIts also more inclusive and might get women and new people more interested in the sport.

Even more granularly, it varies by sector.  So one car may be great in sector 1 because their car is designed for speed, whereas it\u2019s slow in sector 2 because that\u2019s all low speed corners.  Add in the further complexity of tire degradation varying widely based on compound, usage in qualifying, race strategy, design of the car, & setup that day for the car.  Also, the skill level of the drivers seemingly varies pretty widely & each has their own strengths/weaknesses.  Then there\u2019s ERS, the onboard battery, & DRS which works like \u201ccatch up mode\u201d on certain straights.  The points structure also makes even 10th place battles interesting.

                "> I'm not really understanding why Formula 1 is considered to be the \"pinnacle of motorsports\". I tried watching it and didn't get the hype\n\nIt's the pinnacle of motorsport because they're the fastest race cars period, there's a lot of regulatory and safety stuff but they'd be even faster without it probably. It's not called the pinnacle because it has the most exciting racing, you might find that elsewhere.\n\n> I think the biggest reason why I didnt enjoy it was an uneven playing field\n\nThis is just inherent to almost all racing, some types of cars allow for closer racing all things considered but the fact is that's part of the racing, can AlphaTauri manage to squeeze a point out of the race in 10th place? That's like a win for them. I wasn't very into F1 until last year and used to think the same way, but now I find it to be another part of the sport, seeing teams like McLaren add new upgrades to their car and turn their season around from finishing in the bottom 5 some races to getting podiums.\n\n> Sports are meant to be equal\n\nSays who? Racing competitions have always been both a driver and car/engineer competition, again it's just part of the sport, if you don't like that, that's fine but it doesn't mean it's not a real sport because it's \"meant to be equal\".\n\n> this creates a race that features very little overtaking or action in the relevent places, thus making it a bore to watch (at least to me). Why would anyone want to watch a race that features little overtaking and action?\n\nNot necessarily, it depends on the track, I'm sure other racing series have closer racing but there is a decent amount of overtaking, ideally there would be more sure but there's still a lot of other things that factor into the enjoyment of races like changing conditions, strategy calls, how fast are the pit stops, crashes resulting in safety cars, bunching the field back up and becoming an advantage for some and disadvantage for others, some might argue that's not real racing but it's just part of the modern sport.\n\n> \"We're trying to pivot Formula One from a motorsport company to a media and entertainment brand. \" Does that sound like leadership that is passionate about motorsport?\n\nIt doesn't and some of the FIA decisions are questionable, but as of now at least I don't think it's a detriment to the sport.",
                "I think the critical flaw in your argument is you see F1 as a sport between drivers, with teams as just the support staff. However, F1 is truly a sport between entire teams, with two players  of the team (drivers) delivering the final result.\n\nIf you take the F1 analogy to baseball for example, is the chief sports psychologist of Manchester United FC part of why they win? They're are able to spend on a better nutritionist, better coach, get a better practice field, and get better training equipment and facilities in all aspects. From this perspective, soccer is actually lesser of a sport than F1, because there's no cost cap involved. Same with baseball, basketball and every other team sport you could think of, so where do we draw the line?\n\nF1 is a weird sport where most work happens off the field, and the cumulative effects of the recently introduced cost cap haven't shown their full effect. In fact, with the current state of rules, the winner actually gets FEWER resources in comparison to the lower teams (less wind tunnel time), which balances it even further. The only major difference is that teams with a stronger legacy attract better talent, which remains true for every team sport.\n\ntl:dr; - F1 is a sport between teams, not drivers.

Sure the engineers building the cars have more ability to influence the season as the car is definitely more important than the driver but you have to just accept that some seasons will be like this one but that makes the years of Prost vs Senna or Hamilton vs Verstappen all the more worth watching when they do come about. If you want to watch a series where the driver is more important than the machinery I'd suggest indycar but the drivers there are certainly generally a lower standard than F1 and the tracks they race at aren't as good.

There are plenty of world class athletes that have come from Australia male and female and suggesting that more funds should be put into female sports than male sports doesn't make sense at the moment. You don't seem familiar with sports but there already is a massive centre called the AIS that takes Australia's top young athletes male and female and develop their skills and prep them for the top leagues in a lot of sports, which explains why we Excell much better in female sports due to Australia already having things in place for top young female athletes. Other countries focus are either through massive academy's in their perspective sports (which I imagine until recently weren't seen as profitable for women) or other countries with similar programs such as the AIS."

                "Personally, I feel if you were already a male athlete in the same sport, then transition into the women's league. That person's body has a huge advantage over the female born athletes. Their bodies have muscle memory and capability that can't be unlearned after transition. But I don't play sports and have no ties to sports. It's not my place to judge what someone's capable of.",
                "It blows my mind that people can seemingly seriously state there's no evidence that transwomen who transitioned post puberty have an advantage.

                "I wish everyone a happy and fulfilled life and that they can be how they want to be. It shouldn't be at the expense of others, though. So while I think someone born male wanting to live as a woman, they should be able to do so, I draw the line at sports. Since they are different to persons who were born female with regard to their body, they can't compete in women's sports because they have an unfair advantage. Wanting to live as a woman AND wanting to compete in women's sports would mean living the live they want to live at the expense of others. It would be wildly unfair to female born athletes. That's why I would draw a line here. You can't always get everything you want in live and you should be willing to make your peace with it in order not to hurt others, who also have the right to a fair competition. I also think that trans women who want to compete in women's sports not only hurt their competitors but also other trans women, who just want to go about their life and face an imcredible backlash because of the egoistic wishes of a few trans athletes.",

You have a right to participate in sports and compete as a trans athlete \u2014 fine. I have a right to compete in a fair competition as a cis athlete. The solution is to give us separate opportunities, not to _take away my opportunities and give them to you._ There are not finite categories: we create the categories and we can add whatever we need. \n\nWhere I\u2019m mad, is that instead of advocating to have their own, they wanted to take over the category which we fought so hard for. I think that\u2019s wrong and I can\u2019t believe they thought it was okay to try to guilt and shame everybody into going along with it when it\u2019s so obviously wrong.",

It\u2019s unfair to biological women. \n\nVice versa for men who were biologically born as women. There should def be a different \u2018section\u2019 where everyone competes without being categorised.",
                "The physical advantage that men have over women isn\u2019t just because of testosterone and the advantages don\u2019t disappear if a man takes estrogen. \n\nEven after years of taking hormones, transwomen still have bigger hands and feet(to that of a women the same size), a different skeletal shape, greater heart and lung capacity, more muscle strength. \n\nThey also lack the hormone cycle and the ability to get pregnant which can interfere with training. Keep in mind that all *healthy* adult premenopausal women have a hormone cycle and can get pregnant and most women do get pregnant.\n\nI\u2019ve often heard the argument that \u201cnatural athletes have a physical advantage anyways\u201d but female athletes only have a natural physical advantage over *other females*. Males, athletic or not, have a natural physical advantage over all females, even athletic ones. \n\nAnd no, transwomen aren\u2019t smashing world records left and right, but given that there\u2019s so few transwomen athletes, the list of how many times a transwoman has placed ahead in a competition is fairly long. Go to shewon.org to see a list of women, but not all women, who\u2019ve lost a place to a transwoman at a sporting event.",
                "Such a tough question, but I currently think that until we know more, it\u2019s unfair to biological women for trans women to compete alongside them. \n\nI was a pretty good athlete, trained 50 miles a week, got some accolades, etc etc. I can also tell you my younger brother (who ran like 1 mile a year) dusted my PR time at 13 years old in a pair of vans.  You can\u2019t say biology isn\u2019t real - athletes (especially female ones) know this more than anyone. \n\nIt ain\u2019t fair but we need to know more or we\u2019re going backwards on women\u2019s progress.",

                "As an athlete I do not want biological male's competing in my sport. I absolutely do believe trans-women and trans-men should have the opportunity to play sports. I'm just not sure how to accommodate that. I don't know if there are enough trans-athletes to justify a league, but that is my only solution at this point. I am pro-lgbtq+ all the way, but there just are biological differences that make competition unfair.",
                "It frustrates me. Women worked hard to have our own dedicated areas. Im not against Trans rights at all, but those rights should not be allowed to infringe upon the rights of another marginalized group. I feel the same about women's shelters.",
                "It's a tricky subject but also a very obvious one. A trans woman that transitioned *after* their body reach puberty as a male *will* have a *very* stark advantages over AFAB. It's simple biology that can't be denied. AFAB can't ever hope to compete with AMAB trans women. They just can't. \n\nAnother really bad one that recently happened was a trans woman swimmer showering together with other women atheletes. Everything sounds fine *until* the detail about how said trans woman is...quite well endowed down there. She has the body and genitalia of a male. It's extremely uncomfortable. Obviously they destroyed other women athlete during the competition too. It's very unfair and shitty situation all around.",
                "This is where I'm on the fence to be honest. I'm still reading into it, looking for the hard facts and it's hard to find those because usually studies etc do tend to skew in a pro/contra direction.\n\nSo far, it seems a lot depends on how long ago the person transitioned, what age they were and if they were already performing the sport when they were still male.\n\nIn conclusion: still researching but it's a tricky subject for sure.",
                "I do. \nI like sports and allowing opportunity. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair for a cis woman to be disqualified from a sport because she naturally has slightly higher than a recommended amount of testosterone (PCOS) but someone not born a woman is allowed to play in the sport. \n\nI feel like trans athletes need a category for trans women, especially because they are taking funding, schooling and more opportunities from the people they were intended for. \n\nI don\u2019t necessarily have an issue with trans people but their bodies are different. It\u2019s an unfair advantage and it\u2019s not only muscle mass that\u2019s the issue.",
                "Somewhat uncomfortable, but not too much, because I'm far from the sports world. Anyway, I think males and females shouldn't compete against each other in sports, that's not a fair competition.",
                "I find it extremely dismissive and unfair to the cis women in sports. A lot of women are commenting that they \u201cdon\u2019t care\u201d because they aren\u2019t personally invested in sports, and want trans women to feel included. But it\u2019s a weak cop out of an answer. It matters to the women who\u2019ve dedicated their lives to competing, but they aren\u2019t a popular category to defend so suddenly no one cares about feelings anymore when it comes to them.",
                "I don\u2019t think trans women should be able to compete against biological women in female sports. There is a clear physical advantage of biological men over biological women. If there needs to be an open category, then that\u2019s fine with me but it\u2019s unfair to put everyone in the same category.",
                "I'm a queer woman that supports trans people and understand why trans women want to compete in female sports but I draw a line in this category. I'm personally not into sports but some friends are into fitness and sports even in a competitive setting and I can't imagen their frustration after working and training so hard and losing to a trans woman because of their biological and physical advantages, specially if they have gone through puberty. The male and female body IS different, there's no denying that, and there are things that not even a hormone treatment is gonna completely change. I think there should be a way to accommodate trans people into sports, maybe with a unisex category? but letting them compete with cis women is not fair.",
                "I do not see trans women as women. As much as it is their right to believe that they are women, there is my right to believe that they are not women, and why should their beliefs  be superior to mine? I have nothing against trans women, the ones I have been lucky to meet in my life have all been good people and I respect them and their life stories, but in my eyes they are men who want/need to be women, and they shouldn't be allowed to compete together with biological women, unless it's either for fun or for a good cause. World Championships, Olympics, etc - hell no.",

                "Transwomen should not compete in the same category as women, I did some research before and as far there is biological differences depending on age when transistioned ect ect so as in that aspect it's not fair to the rest of the women. I make exceptions for those born the same gender with slight differences those are out of your control in my opinion. Boxing and wrestling I know there have been issues here it just won't work you know it is so even if some want it another way.",

( because they don't stand a chance )\n\nIts insane and unfair. And if this continues it will destroy womens sports.",
                "I'm pro-trans but I *absolutely* believe that sports should be limited to the gender you're born in. It might not be fair to the people who have transitioned but then, the opposite is unfair to people who *haven't* transitioned. \n\nThe way that we're doing it in the UK is the fairest way. Women's sports are open to anyone born as a woman. Men's sports are open to anyone.",
                "Honestly, I don't think I know enough about the topic to make a secure decision, I think this should be left to unbiased doctors or scientists who have a much deeper comprehension of the topic. \n\nWith that said, from what I know, trans women that go through gender affirming care that includes hormones will have muscles that are within the normal parameter for cis women. The trans women that are breaking records are probably long-time athletes who have worked very hard, so it's not unusual that they would break some records. \n\nLike your girlfriend, I'm not that much into sports, so the truth is this isn't something I'm particularly passionate or worried about though.

Biological, women are build different than men in term of muscle. Women have naturally higher fat percentage, men have natural testosterone to help them build more muscle. You cannot easily change that after a dude chop of his dick. \n\nThe sport should not be \u201cman\u201d and \u201cnot man\u201d gender. We like it because it challenges our biological barriers. That is why Olympic has so much restrictions on drugs use because it is considered \u201cnot nature\u201c then how is transgender not an \u201cnot nature\u201d is beyond me. \n\nAlso, if the goal is promote right of of Trans athletes, why not have its own category?

If a person is trans and competing, they are not setting a new record for women, they are setting an inaugural record for trans. They should place beside whoever crosses the finish line after them and essentially share that place. It sucks that this issue mostly seems to affect women\u2019s sports, but we need to find a way to make things fair.",
                "It's a complicated conversation to have honestly, but definitely one worth having. I personally believe that if a transwoman *hasn't* gone through male puberty, then I don't see a problem with them competing with cis women. If they have, then I think there *can* be a difference in performance and they shouldn't compete. An additional unisex league would be the easiest workaround imo, but that would probably require a lot more people be interested enough in a sport to start something along those lines.\n\n\n\nThat being said, I still believe transwomen should be treated socially as women, as treating someone properly has nothing to do with what sports team they should be on.",
                "I'm not really into sports and I have no problems with trans people. I'm also not very well read on this matter. \nHowever, don't men and women compete separately for a reason? Someone here said something about having a third category, \"unisex\". Feels like that would be the way to go.\nWomen with higher levels of testosterone and men with lower levels could go in that category too.",
                "To me the whole sports competition culture is super weird to start with. Is it \"fair\" that tall people have advantages in basketball and light people have advantages in gymnastics and rock climbing or people with certain genetics produce less lactic acid letting them excel in long sprints? 95-99% of people, even really driven people just don't have something that it requires to become elite athletes. More don't have the opportunity to train or study in a way that could get them to that level. One small advantage among a host of other uncontrollable advantages really doesn't bother me.\n\nFurther, there aren't really a large number of transgender athletes \"crushing\" women's records. For example, the transgender swimmer Lia Thomas is good, but not dominating women's swimming by any means. From Wikipedia (because I can't be assed to spend more than 30s on this internet debate) \n\n>\"According to the swimming data website Swimcloud, Thomas is ranked 36th among female college swimmers in the United States for the 2021\u20132022 season, and 46th among women swimmers nationally.\"\n\nThis may get her to the Olympics, with emphasis on may, but it's not like she's guaranteed  a podium placement let alone gold.",

                "I find this always a hard question to answer. But for me it would not matter, there are also women (born female) in sports that have high level of testosteron wich could help build muscle. In a way you can say that is not fair either. So what would be the deffintion for a person to compeet in womens sports? \nSo i don't care if someone compeet in de womens sports events, as long as they love the sport and are passioned about it.",

                "I really don\u2019t care.",
                "My only thought on this is : they should have their own Olympic/category (idk which one of those words is actually used in English to describe it without it being a big event), just like men has their category, just like women had fought and struggle to have their own category, kids have their own category, animals have their own category and lastly just like people with an handicap have their own category as well.\n\nYes, by now I do get it trans are men/women, we all get it, yet things will not reach a resolution point by keeping on being like this, it is not because they can have their own category that it will make them less of a trans woman/man and it will actually get them an easier support from those who does and protect them a bit more from those who don\u2019t + brings better awareness to it because people will internationally start being more used to, type of thing.\n\nBut then besides that I personally don\u2019t give a single fucks cause it don\u2019t impact my life in any shape or form so people do whatever they want I couldn\u2019t care less, whether there\u2019s a trans category or trans people merging with biological people\u2019s category.",

Make a new category, don't gender the categories, just bracket them by some other factor. Have more than 2-3 categories. I don't know enough about sports to tell you how to do that. I do know enough about life to tell you that it's possible.",
                "Not trans, but it doesn't bother me one bit. \n\nAlso, those articles like to mention they transitioned after puberty, but fail to mention that for these trans women to compete with women that they have to have been on their hormone treatments for a certain amount of time, and their levels are checked. They aren't just allowed to join *most* of the time, it's a process.",
                "I\u2019m not too interested in sports so my thinking on this isn\u2019t that well thought out but honestly I don\u2019t care - Simone Biles is predisposed to being brilliant at gymnastics because of the way her body is built - should she not compete because it\u2019s unfair on others? I think it\u2019s a stupid dog whistle that encourages what the right and TERFs would call the culture war. Trans people aren\u2019t trans to fuck over cis people.",
                "I actually don\u2019t care. I just hate the stupid arguments that ppl make about biological advantages. Too many cis black women in sports are crucified for their biological advantages over other cis women for me to not think something more sinister is afoot.",
                "Jesus Christ, this again.\n\nFirst of all: Most trans athletes do not break records. They just participate like everyone else does, and sometimes they win. Because, you know, they trained for it.\n\nSecondly: The biological advantages a trans woman *might* have decline over time, as she takes estrogen.\n\nThirdly: Biological advantages are what makes winners in all super high level sports. Think about Michael Phelps - he got all his medals because he basically is a freak of nature. Is it cheating that his body works differently than others? Or is it just expected that at the level our top athletes perform today wins aren't just decided by talent, but also by how far our human bodies can physically go?\n\nAnd fourthly: Banning trans athletes harms all women. There is a runner, I think her name is Caster Semenya, who is an olympic medal level athlete. She produces a lot of testosterone, and was forced to undergo sex testing and was banned from some races because of it. She was also forced to take hormone blockers, which made her sick, if she wanted to participate in races. And this is all with official findings still ruling that there is not enough evidence to even say that high testosterone is an advantage. And high testosterone does not make her less of a woman.\n\nAnd lastly: I am happy for any woman who achieves her dreams and pushes new records. I don't give a flying fuck if they are cis or trans.",

What people don't know, and what the news doesn't bother to report on, is that the hormones therapy causes them to loose that muscle mass and bio-male strength and stamina. After a few years on estrogen,  they're even at risk for osteoporosis,  just like the rest of us. Yeah, even their bones become less dense! \n\nA simple rule that you have to be on HRT for at least a couple of years would do the trick. Most places already have that rule.\n\nAlso: trans women are less than 1% of the human population,  and they don't all play competitive sports. We're talking about a tiny fraction of a tiny fraction. \n\nThis is mostly a strawman argument,  right wing propaganda designed to make you hate queer people.

I don\u2019t like the narrative that \u201cmen want an easy win so they will pretend to be women\u201d like I guess it\u2019s possible but I just can\u2019t see that happening much.\n\nThe solution imo is to separate by ability/skill level rather than gender. Do some kind of fitness test at the beginning of the season and get placed appropriately. Im not much of a sports person so Im not sure how well that would work.",
                "I think blanket bans are the wrong choice because there will always be people who fall through the cracks. Trans athletes gave a variety of unique circumstances that should be weighed on an individual basis until now data is collected about longitudinal affects of hrt in athletics. Furthermore, not all trans individuals go through puberty in their biological sex body. There is a big difference between a trans woman that started hrt at 20 and one that took puberty blockers until she was 16 and then started hrt directly.",
                "I'm concerned but also know there are a *lot* of factors and situations to consider in a nuanced view. There are also other related issues that I want to see solved and that should maybe be considered together, like, how do we want to handle cis women who naturally produce more testosterone than is considered normal and are subsuqently disqualified? Should this be viewed the same way as other nautral variations? Also, what the heckity do we want to do with intersex individuals? If more people get genetic testing, more people may know they're intersex that haven't had apparent problems. I also think it's interesting that despite all the contorversy I barely see trans athletes sweeping the board and getting first.  I admit this could be a bias in what I am exposed to, but based on what little I have seen, the stories are about placing or even simply participating, not winning every competition. This sort of diminishes my concern that the differences are actually significant. An interesting thing about differences is that there can be a statisitical significance between two variables but that does not necessarily mean there is a *practical* significance (how the results impact the real world). We don't even have good research that quantified what these differences may be. So again, I have some concern but don't claim to know everything there is to consider or have the most nuanced view. A lot of people make dramatic claims (in either direction) that we simply don't have the research to support.",

                "I simply want a coed category in sports that is divided by skill level rather than gender. I am AFAB and nonbinary and I have always wished the sports I played were not segregated. \n\nFor one, I'm tired of the idea that no woman could ever beat any man at any physical sport. Sex-based physical characteristics are on a spectrum, and on average men are stronger than women, but that isn't true across the board. There certainly are women who can best many men in a given sport. I want, and have always wanted, the chance to try. I don't like being told what I can't do without even being given the opportunity to try. \n\nSecondly, it would solve this problem of transgender women in sports. I don't mind them competing in the female category personally, but I do hear people's concerns about physical advantages. \n\nBut thirdly, I think especially pre-puberty, there is no reason for sports to be segregated. I think it does, especially young boys, damage to not have to integrate and interact with girls in a casual environment. I think a coed category for sports would help kids develop social skills and help prevent some of the gender segregation that teaches kids fucked up gender roles. \n\nThat's just my 2 cents.",
                "I'm not into sports so I don't care. I think eventually there will be no women sports or there will have to be an other category. Most women cannot compete professionally against men. That was one of the many reasons for the split in men's and women's sport to begin with.",
                "'they biologically have an advantage' a SLIGHT one. Also there's a trans man (I forget his name) who is an undefeated boxer against ci's men. Once they start taking hormone replacements the 'advantage' is going to diminish. The belief that all amab people are better than afab people is  internalised misogyny. There is a slight advantage, I'm not denying that in some aspects cis men out perform cis women. However, if you're going to ban trans women from sport you might as well ban cis women who had athletic parents or some other advantage like that. It's demeaning to state that amab people are naturally stronger in all aspects than afab people.",
                "so, i\u2019m reading a lot of your comments and i hear you.\n\nhowever, i think we really need to change the way we think about sports. we started the olympics because we were sick of going to war and it satisfied our need for social interaction and physical touch. \n\nbut. we can just play cooperatively and build stuff together now. it doesn\u2019t have to be a competition.",
                "Trans women should be welcomed into women's sports.\n\nLet's look at Michael Phelps. He's proportioned in such a way that he has physical advantages over other cis men. Is he scrutinized for having such an enormous wingspan in comparison to other swimmers? Nope. That's just his biology. That's just how he was born.\n\nFrankly, nobody sends to care about women's sports until someone like Caster Semenya or Lia Thomas pops up. If you didn't care about the sport before, it's disingenuous at best and transphobic at worst to have strong feelings when someone who is trans or intersex competing.",
                "It bothers me yes, but I\u2018m not in sports so I don\u2019t think about it much. \n\nI think there should be a seperate league for people with an advantage like that. Just like there are leagues for people with disadvantages. \nThat would be a fair solution for everyone.",
                "This is not how the conversation would go, and it\u2019s kind of refreshing. \n\nImo, they should make a league like in the Olympics where there\u2019s a mix of women and men (co-ed) like the swimming relays they did with men and women on the same team. This way trans woman and trans men can be included. Also, it allows woman\u2019s sports to remain competitively fair (against biological females) and same for biological men (who run into less issues competitions against biological females)."

I actually want to start hunting once I relocate somewhere with more wildlife available. It's an active, rewarding, and overall healthier way to eat, and to me it gives each meal more value and meaning, since you have a more intimate and knowledgeable relationship with hunted meat unlike anything you can buy at the store. However, as I've been researching the practices and guidelines for hunting, or when I try to learn more about the prey species in a region, I keep seeing photo after photo of jolly, grinning hunters posed above their kills, and it always rubs me the wrong way.\n\nLook, I get it. Hunting is a rigorous, challenging activity at times, and requires a lot of skill and patience to pursue. However, i personally feel that having respect and decency for your quarry is the least we can do, since it's the animal's death that fuels our lives. Yet this culture that's grown around posing above a dead carcas as if you've opened a birthday present comes off as incredibly arrogant and disrespectful to the animal, treating it as a mere trophy rather than a being who lived, breathed, and died so you can eat. Killing another creature, even if you intend to use every inch of meat, bone or pelt, isn't something to boast or be too proud about.\n\nDoes anyone else feel similar here?",

So having industrial animal production and outsourcing all of the death and butchering is fine, because you don't see it? Absolute bullshit, to me.\n\nSuccessfully bagging a deer/antelope/elk/etc is difficult work. It's a lot of preparation, a lot of money, and a lot of skill. It's early mornings, it's a lot of walking, a lot of sitting still, etc. Yeah, I'm generally pretty proud of myself when I manage to snag an animal which I have a license and tag for that is an overpopulated animal in the first place (which is the only reason they issue tags).\n\nTo me, sinking your teeth into a hamburger at a cookout and being happy is the same thing as smiling when you get a buck. The difference is that one guy owns it and the other guy is a hypocrite who's outsourcing the morality quandary.\n\nEdit: and I upvoted this because while I disagree with your opinion I think it's a worthwhile topic and people can having different opinions.\n\nEdit2: and just realized he did it with an arrow.

Will I take a picture of the animal after I have it? Probably not, but I don't fault those who do. I think an animal is beautiful in the wild, and I'd rather have a photograph of it that way, but to each his own. People celebrate the beauty of nature in their own way. \n\nOn the flip side, if someone hunts just for the trophy with no respect for the animal or the food it provides, that's where I have an issue.",

I would happily talk for hours on the subject, including how it interacts with gun culture as well. \n\nFirst, from an ecology standpoint, killing a large, mature male of a deer species is less harmful than a female. They also tend to be the ones with large antlers, considered to be a \"trophy\". For those unaware, if you have 50 females and 15 males, 50 females are getting mated with. 50 females and 8 males, still the same situation. \n\nThat being said, I hunt for meat, and antlers don't taste good. \n\nI keep some skulls, and occasionally take a photo, if it's a hunt I have reasons to really want memories from. I show them to friends who ask, but I draw a line well before posting online. The same as if I am driving a carcass in the back of my truck, I cover it up, and I don't go into a gas station wearing bloody hunting clothes. Not everyone wants to see it, and I think it's disrespectful to force others to do so. I also don't pose with the animal, as that feels disrespectful to me. The pose that most hunters take is intentionally creating a foreshortening perspective to make the animal appear larger in comparison, which is pure ego. \n\nLong story short, I'm an avid hunter, try to keep my ego out of it, and don't force others to interact.",

Are you just as offended about [this picture](https://www.welcometocountry.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/1975112505.jpg)? Hunting takes time, skill, and a shit ton of effort. And when all that pays off and you get that dopamine release, you can't help but want to celebrate. \n\nNow, the rich assholes who pay thousands to fly half way around the world and go kill lions and other animals like that...

I weep when I kill it and reflect on what that means, the gravity of the moment and the harsh reality that is our existence. And I snap a picture like this so I'll never forget what that animal meant to me.\n\nSo while there are plenty of rich, tax evasion nepo-babies that do go out and kill for sport and take pictures, a lot of people that you may think are doing that, are not.\n\nAnd heck, even a lot of those douche bag sport hunters donate their harvest to feed the hungry, which, while I don't agree with it, is still a much more ethically produced meal than cheeseburgers from the grocery store.\n\nThe only times I'll hate on a sport hunter are if they are wasting the meat, not hunting ethically, or hunting endangered or at risk species.",

Why wouldn't you want to show your work? In fact we should say way way more of this and i will make my job to do so, since pretending that meat comes from space lasers is way more damaging to everything.   \n\n\nLastly, lots of people have ego, the healthier things that ego is tied to , the better.",

Bow hunting is very difficult and often many hours are spent freezing your ass off in a stand and months of tracking deer movements trying to shoot an animal in a very short time frame.  \n\nIf you do start hunting you will begin to understand how much energy goes into eventually taking a picture with an animal you just killed. It is an amazing moment and one that should be captured.",
                "I'd argue this guy isn't sport hunting. That's a lot of meat he's bagged. I detest sport hunting myself, but even I'll take pictures with challenging hunts to honor the experience and the memory of how much effort went into it. Photos of wankers with obviously elderly bull elephants and huge grizzlies with worn teeth (old, but impressively large animals), are a dead give away that the hunter was after the trophy, rather than the food... and that's lame. But cheesing homeboy with a nice buck? He's fine.",
                "I can guarantee you'll change your mind when(if) you actually start hunting. Even if it's soley for food, you'll understand the 'sport' behind it. It's a challenge, it takes skill, effort, tactics, planning and patience. When you get within shooting distance of your first deer, you'll understand the excitement of it, once the adreneline kicks in and you start shaking. When you get your first kill, secure a years worth of meat, and achieve the goal you set out to accomplish , you'll understand the happiness that comes with achieving the goals you worked so hard for. You'll understand why you want a picture to commemorate the big moment, and a memory to cherish and show off. When you take that picture you'll be smiling with pride. You'll gladly keep the antlers(trophy) and display them with pride, telling the story to your friends and family. You'll feel much more respect for the animal than you currently do, because you'll understand what it sacrificed in order for you to survive. You'll feel the strange mix of excitement and sadness that comes with taking a life. Your current sentiment is only held by people who have never hunted in their life. Someday You'll see, and only then will you understand. Someday you'll be explaining this exact thing to someone who is 'against sport and trophy hunting'.",

I do think the pro WTC stuff, and maybe even the Ironman World Champs now they have departed somewhat from Kona, should include a greater proportion of swimming.

An average swim would be 3.5 hours. That's a lot of time and a lot of danger in the water. Most triathlons related deaths are drawing. \n\nI get your point of distance not really even. But if you think about it, effort wise swimming 2.4 miles is already a hard and dangerous as it is. It may have started as the distance of different races in Hawaii, but I think organizers are cognizant of the swimming dangers. Not everyone is an Olympic level athlete capable of swimming 10k on open water. Moving the swimming distance to be 10k would make IM a much less accessible sport. If I were a betting person I would bet most people's less favorite thing to do is drowning during a triathlon.\n\nAnd all of this is on top of the amount of effort required to train to swim for 10k. That on itself it's a ridiculously hard thing, and now we are talking about racing ... nope",

Percent of participants participating at each distance? Amount of training time for a given pace and distance?\n\nYou'll get different answers for different people.\n\nOriginally coming from more of a cycling background, I thought it was strange how short the cycling distances were for shorter events (I'm not sure the 140.6 is the cycling version of a marathon either \u2014 see, e.g., the TdF). My guess is people coming from each discipline will see the distances as off with what they're familiar with.",
                "The swim is still a make or break discipline in pro triathlon races. Lionel Sanders would probably be a 2-3 time World Champion if he was a front group swimmer. Lucy Charles would probably be a mid pack pro if she wasn't such a great swimmer. I feel like if you are a great swimmer, you can transition better to triathlons and have better immediate results. If you are a terrible swimmer you pretty much have no chance in elite races. If the swim distance was longer, you would have the best swimmer winning every race",

It's still a significant risk.\n\nFrom a personal view, I enjoy the balance of an Olympic over a Quarter, and I'd like a HIM style with more swimming, perhaps everything double distance (so 3km for the swim)",

People mention you don't need to double sleeve your whole deck. This is true, but do keep in mind that in tournaments you either need to have it all double sleeved or not at all. If it's partially double sleeved, it's considered marking your cards. This likely won't apply to commander at all for you, but I figured I'd mention it just so you knew if it ever comes up.",

Wei\u00df nicht, wie es heute ist, aber fr\u00fcher konnte man \u00fcbers Sportlehramt auch ohne Abitur an Schulen Lehrer werden. Die hatten dann teilweise keine didaktische Ausbildung, usw. Da hat man dann wahlweise Fussball gespielt oder am Reck geturnt. Beides nicht meine beliebtesten Optionen. Und in beiden F\u00e4llen hat man nicht irgendwie trainiert, was ge\u00fcbt oder gelernt, sondern einfach 90 Minuten gemacht und dann war gut. Das und in Kombination damit, dass ich halt absolut kein Talent f\u00fcr Fussball habe oder in irgendeiner Form am Reck ne gute Figur mache, war ziemlich entt\u00e4uschend f\u00fcr mich. \n\nNach dem Abi hab ich dann mit American Football angefangen und am Ende sogar zwei Jahre in der GFL gespielt.",

Hatte sich in der Oberstufe, wo man mich mehr akzeptiert hatte, auch merklich gebessert. Da ist den Leuten auf einmal aufgefallen, dass ich zwar nicht besonders schnell oder stsrk bin, aber meine Ausdauer viel rausrei\u00dft.",

                "Mittlerweile gut. Ich verfolge viele Einzelsportarten: Schlittschuhlaufen, Inline Skaten, Fitness Studio, Laufsport, Bouldern. An Vereinssport kam ich bis auf Kampfsport nicht ran. Sport in Teams f\u00e4llt komplett flach. Ich habe und hatte einfach nie diesen Ehrgeiz irgendwas zu gewinnen. Bei Sportarten, denen ich zuschaue (Eishockey, Handball), empfinde ich auch kein Mifiebern. Das war damals in der Schule auch immer mein Problem: dass es mich einfach nicht interessierte, wer gewinnt oder welche Note ich bekomme. :D",
                "ich muss sagen, dass ich nur schlechte Erinnerungen an Schulsport habe, was aber nicht nur am zuletzt gew\u00e4hlten liegt, sondern auch an einer Sportlehrerin, die mich gemobbt hat. Das verfolgt mich bis heute (bin 30+) und heute w\u00fcrde man wohl dagegen vorgehen. Nunja. Ich hab vor 5 Jahren dennoch begonnen mich mit dem Thema Sport auseinander zu setzen, dass Sport nicht nur negativ ist, sondern gesund, und habe seitdem auch 30 kg abgenommen und mache 3-4x die Woche Sport, allerdings daheim mit Workouts und Laufband, weil ich mich immer noch unwohl f\u00fchle, sobald mir jemand dabei zusehen w\u00fcrde. Also gespalten, das Ganze. Ich glaube die Lehrer/innen wissen gar nicht, dass sie einem das Leben so versauen k\u00f6nnen.",

Ich wurde damals auch nicht unbedingt aus \"unbeliebtheitsgr\u00fcnden\" (mir f\u00e4llt kein besseres Wort ein) immer zuletzt gew\u00e4hlt sondern weil alle wussten dass ich eh nie richtig mitgemacht habe beim Sportunterricht. Sprich absichtlich abwerfen lassen, einfach nur rumgammeln, usw.\nZum Sport selbst hat sich die Beziehung nie ge\u00e4ndert.

                "Mach regelm\u00e4\u00dfig Sport und binde es gut in die Woche ein. Sonst wird mich keiner dazu zwingen, und fettleibig mit 110kg hatte ich auch kein gutes wohlgef\u00fchl mehr. Ich liebe essen! Jedoch esse ich nun mehr gesunde Sachen und bereite sie mir schmackhaft zu, damit ich davon satt werde. Ich g\u00f6nn mir auch Fastfood und ungesundes, jedoch jetzt seltener als wie vor 6 Jahren, wo es jeden Tag so war. Sport in der Schule dient lediglich dem Stressabbau von den jeweiligen Sch\u00fclern. Man sollte ihnen auch beibringen wie man es gut in die Woche einbringen kann, da die meisten so wie ich damals, nach dem Abschluss, kein bisschen Sport machen werden.",
                "Ich war damals ein Leistungssportler. Ich konnte nur nicht mit B\u00e4llen umgehen. Dh in der einen Woche wurde ich beim Volleyball als letztes gew\u00e4hlt.

Ich kann mich noch erinnern wie der Lehrer mir immer mahnend\nzu verstehen gab, dass ich die 4 nur aus Mitleid bekommen h\u00e4tte und es ihn immer genervt hatte f\u00fcr mich als Letzten im Ziel zu warten. Trotzdem war ich aufgrund meines Handicaps immer Stolz auf die 4.\n\nDamals war es mir peinlich mein Asthma zuzugeben, weil ich in der Sekundarstufe deswegen immer gemobbt wurde.

R\u00fcckblickend war das nat\u00fcrlich d\u00e4mlich aber damals hatte ich mich so damit arrangiert.\n\nMeine Beziehung zu Teamarbeit ist immernoch schlecht. Hatte mich nur angestrengt sofern es um Noten ging oder ich wirklich mal Bock hatte, was selten war.

Ergo hab ich mich auch nicht darum gerissen, mich da irgendwie aktiv zu beteiligen. Ich glaube, ab der 9.Klasse habe ich mich nicht mal mehr umgezogen. Wozu auch, ich sa\u00df ja eh die meiste Zeit auf der Bank.   \nNeben dem obligatorischen \"zuletzt ausgew\u00e4hlt werden\" gabs da noch ganz andere Sachen,die mich da im Sportunterricht immer gest\u00f6rt haben:  \n\n\na) das \"Sprungbrett\", das man z.B. zum Bockspringen benutzen sollte, war schon damals fast 40 Jahre alt und entsprechend ausgeleiert. Federwirkung Null.   \nb) Wenn irgendwelche Ger\u00e4te aufgebaut waren, dann blieben die f\u00fcr alle Altersklassen \u00fcber den Tag verteilt aufgebaut...in den selben Einstellungen. Und da die \u00e4lteren Jahrg\u00e4nge eher um die Mittagszeit bzw am fr\u00fchen Nachmittag Sportunterricht hatten, hie\u00df dass, dass Barren etc. fr\u00fchs schon von den Grundsch\u00fclern benutzt wurde und auf deren Gr\u00f6\u00dfe eingestellt war. Na toll, turne mal als 15- oder 16j\u00e4hriger an einem Barren, dessen Holme auf die H\u00fcftbreite eines Zweitkl\u00e4sslers eingestellt war. Gleiches gilt f\u00fcr die H\u00f6heneinstellung: mach mal einen H\u00fcftaufschwung, wenn du dich schon im Stehen fast ein St\u00fcck runterbeugen musst, um die Stange \u00fcberhaupt ber\u00fchren zu k\u00f6nnen.  \nc) Leichtathletik auf dem Schulsportplatz. Faktisch bestand das nur aus 2 Sportarten: 60m/1000m Lauf und Weitsprung. Geile Idee, den Klassenmoppel gegen das Sport-As der Klasse laufen zu lassen. Und um Weitsprung hat sich JEDER gedr\u00fcckt. Denn neben dem Sportplatz war eine Kleingartenanlage, deren Bewohner den Sandkasten gerne als Au\u00dfentoilette ihrer Hunde benutzten.\n\nPrivat habe ich damals nur eine Sportart betrieben: Kegeln. Da war ich auch richtig gut...aber nur,wenn ich es noch aus Spa\u00df machte. Wettbewerbe hingegen habe ich regelrecht gehasst. Dieser Wettkampfgedanke (der damals in der DDR noch deutlich ausgepr\u00e4gter war als heute) war mir stets zuwider, was auch meinen Leistungen anzumerken war. Irgendwann nach der Wende wurde der Kegelverein dann aufgel\u00f6st,weil die Kegelbahn abgebaut wurde. Die befand sich n\u00e4mlich in einer Holzbarracke, die fr\u00fcher mal eine H\u00e4ftlingsbarracke im nahegelegenen KZ war...und die KZ-Gedenkst\u00e4tte wollte diese gerne wiederhaben.\nJetzt bin ich 48 und Sport ist f\u00fcr mich....nunja...ich sag mal so: im TV habe ich Eurosport & Sport1 nicht mal in der Senderliste gespeichert, entsprechend mache ich auch selbst keinen.",

Dann wurde ich immer ins Abseits geschickt und von den Lehrern angebr\u00fcllt, warum ich nie mitmachen w\u00fcrde. Hatte zum Gl\u00fcck einen Klassenlehrer, der sich sehr f\u00fcr mich eingesetzt hat und daf\u00fcr gesorgt hat, dass ich wenigstens eine 4- f\u00fcrs nicht Verweigern bekomme; eigentlich wollte er wohl auch ansto\u00dfen, dass da mal ein Arzt drauf schaut, warum ich da so enorme Defizite habe und vllt einen Attest kriege, aber da waren meine Eltern komplett dagegen (\u201ekann ja nicht jeder eine Extrawurst gebraten kriegen\u201c).\n\nNach der Schule hab ich dann ein paar ungesunde Freundschaften und Beziehungen begonnen und daraufhin eine Essst\u00f6rung entwickelt. Ich hab dann eine Zeit sehr regelm\u00e4\u00dfig Sport gemacht - Individualsport, d.h. Cardio im Fitnessstudio -, aber gesund war das auch nicht, sondern eher eine Bestrafung f\u00fcr mich. Ich hab in der Zeit extrem wenig gegessen und eigentlich jeden Tag versucht, die aufgenommenen Kalorien zu verbrennen, und Bingeanf\u00e4lle \u201eauszugleichen\u201c, weil ich vollkommen \u00fcberzeugt davon war, abgrundtief fett und h\u00e4sslich zu sein.

Gruppensport ist wegen der Schule gar keine Option mehr, und Krafttraining interessiert mich nicht.

Assuming the Flash is allowed to use his powers (minus the outlier reality warping, just plain ol' super fast speed and other like abilities), I think most if not all contests that are physical are out of the question. Chess, archery, bowling, cards, etc., these are all things that can be covertly manipulated to his favor. He can access a chess bot, he can create wind and vortexes to alter trajectory, he can sneak cards in, etc.\n\n2. Thus that leaves us with something virtual. \n\n3. Now it would be unfair to just drop him into a game he's never played, so let's assume that in any game he's put in, he at least understands the fundamentals of the game.\n\n4. That would mean Fighting Games are out. If he can frame-perfect parry every hit, then even with fundamentals he could win. \n\n5. RTS is also out. Games like Starcraft, he can micro every unit to perfection.\n\n6. So if the Flash is capable of playing on a frame-by-frame level, then the only playing field that a non-superpowered human can actually match him in... is Speedrunning. Which already has players performing frame-perfect input. \n\n8. Even if the Flash understands the fundamentals of a speedrun, it's not enough to win. There are routes and optimization that only someone who's put in 40,000+ runs will understand. And in most speed runs, just being able to input faster gives no advantage. \n\n9.

He was a top-5 pitcher in the league for probably 7 years (which is a typical timeframe for evaluating HOF candidates) but he just doesn\u2019t have counting stats with his steep dropoff in his early 30s. I wish the hall wouldn\u2019t prioritize compilers over guys with actual elite production over a sustained peak of 7-10 years",
                "Felix was outstanding at a time when the Ms were awful. He wasn't appreciated enough for how good he was in his prime and his prime was over too soon to demonstrate longevity and curate the conversation around him as an all time great.

I'd have any guy in that position in the HOF, but then I'm a big hall guy, and I feel like that's often the minority view.",

                "As awesome as Felix was for 10 years, he clearly needed to learn to pitch differently his last few years. And TBH, at that point having the King's Court chanting K K K K K every time he got two strikes on a batter didn't help. Felix (and the fans) wanted him to be the pitcher he always was, but it wasn't what he needed to try to do.",

Plus Koufax had an injury that couldn't be treated causing him to retire early. Felix just got bad. He had 10 years of being the King but he sucked once he hit his 30s. We literally cut him from the team. And let's stop with the whole career in Seattle. He was signed and cut from other teams. If Felix was able to stay in the league and even be league average for his 30s then maybe. But he's got less than 200 Ws and less than 50 WAR. He has the peak of a hall of famer but doesn't have the career of one. It pains me to say but it's the truth.",

We will never see a 300 game winner again. Pitchers getting a complete game shutout are insanely rare these days. The voters will need to adjust or no pitcher on the fringes will be inducted again.",
                "I think the lack of playoff action hurts him.  Of course, it's not fair, as whether a team goes to the playoffs does not depend on a single pitcher (who only pitches once every five games or so).  However, I cannot think of a recent HOF player who has never gone to the playoffs.\n\nNote I'm talking about practically speaking if he's likely to go to HOF, not whether he deserves to."

                "The only reason why this would not be a good signing would be if Illing Jr was included in the deal as he is relatively old. As a standalone transfer it would be foolish to pass by if the terms are acceptable.\n\nBut to say he isn't Juventus quality is ludicrous. He's a exceptional, proven serie a player whose talent is limited by the team he's playing in - he is a great player that would complement very well Vlahovic and Chiesa. Doubters probably have never seen him play",

                "Please no Illing swap, please. Illing is talent and English also, we can sell him 50+ to epl clubs.",

                "I\u2019m probably in the minority but I\u2019d be thrilled. Berardi\u2019s never been reliant on speed or strength, so I see his game improving as he gets older. He\u2019s a creative/pass first winger. If there\u2019s any player to find dusan on a run behind the defense, it\u2019s Berardi. A chiesa, dusan, Berardi front 3 is incredibly balanced and each one of them has their own primary attacking threat which can give us a lot of flexibility breaking down any kind of defenses",
                "Berardi would be an amazing signing, would fit perfectly with the mediocrity of most of his teammates",
                "Not sure if I like this or not. It would really depend on the structure of the deal I would say. Berardi just turned 29, so not sure how many good years we can still expect from him. That being said, I see he was worth 20/30 goals+assists a season, which I think are great numbers. \nIf it doesn't cost us Iling, more then 25m or a contract of more then 3 years I think this is nice.",

Where is the younger version attacker that isn't as well known that comes maybe cheaper - those are the guys I thought we would be going for?  I'm not a fan of the player as I think he's a dick, but more importantly I absolutely don't like the price tag so if we are going to spend this amount spend it on someone that can still appreciate in value.

If we can get him cheap and we don\u2019t have to lose any promising talent like Illing then I would be more ok with it. At least it would give us another rotation player.",
                "I remember buying Berardi at the first fantacalcio when he got in Serie A and I bought him at 1 in two different leagues when nobody knew about him. I've always liked the guy.\n\nBut I don't know, I feel like since euro 2020 he basically topped and isn't showing signs of improvement, and his game overall does have a lot of limits at the moment. \n\nHopefully if he has the right kind of personality, a move to a more prestigious side as Juve could ignite in him the ambition to become a really good player once again.",
                "If we\u2019re not losing young player in exchange I don\u2019t see a downside. He\u2019s relatively high output winger, he\u2019s consistent, he has 10-15 goals per season in last 5-6 years. If he comes for 25m, great deal. I love this young players idea and I hope Giuntoli will continue with this but every team needs few older experienced players. And honestly, 29 it\u2019s not the old, he still has 3-4 strong seasons in front of him. Personally, I don\u2019t see a problem with this idea and I hope it will happen.",

Losses hurt his whole image because he\u2019s doing all this posturing for nothing and it stops it being believable. \n\nNow a mid card wrestler with a run of losses is just there to elevate other wrestlers so it\u2019s safe to assume their momentum is dead in the water for the time being and they quite close to being buried all together. Dana Brooke and Cedric Alexander are prime example of this. You don\u2019t see them any more.\n\nReally depends on the situation but wrestling is about momentum.

                "As others have said, the context of the loss matters.\n\nBut the other thing to keep in mind, and I guess I'll put a SPOILER ALERT here just in case - wrestling IS actually scripted.\n\nIn another sport, a loss just means that they weren't playing quite as well as the other guy/team on that particular night.  Take baseball, for example - it's extremely rare for a team to have an undefeated season, so even the best teams regularly lose some games.  It's also uncommon for a team to sweep the World series, which means that even the champion team is losing games right before they win the championship.  So someone losing any individual game doesn't really mean much.\n\nBut pro wrestling has a layer that baseball simply doesn't - storytelling.  And wins and losses do absolutely have an impact on the stories being told about different wrestlers.\n\nSomeone losing as part of an underdog story can HELP their career.\n\nSomeone losing because the odds keep getting stacked against them can be a sign that WWE has big plans for them.\n\nBut if a wrestler keeps losing and there's no real story being told, it just tells us that WWE doesn't seem to have any storyline plans for them.  \n\nAnd if you look at history, the losses we complain about the most are the ones that ruin a story.  Think about Goldberg being beaten by a single sledgehammer shot in the Chamber.  Think about the Fiend losing to Goldberg in Saudi.  \n\nWhat these losses suggest is that WWE isn't going to strike while the iron's hot, because someone else's story is more important.  And that hurts our ability to invest in the loser moving forward.",
                "It can go both ways. A superstar losing could mean they are putting over newer talent or they lose because it\u2019s apart of a storyline. They also have redemption stories where they go from losing every match to becoming a main eventer of some sort.",

                "One loss doesn\u2019t make someone look weak.  A string of several losses in a row, mixed with terrible  storyline booking, is what makes them look weak.",
                "It depends on how when and (sometimes) where they lose any and everybody can and will lose but if a wrestler is picking up incredible momentum and or is getting over with the crowd and them losing to someone with not as much as momentum or overness makes them look like the momentum they gained was really worth nothing or \"weak\"",
                "Really depends on the loss. But if a wrestler is built up to be some dominate and force but keeps losing then they aren\u2019t going to look like a dominate force. Pro Wrestling is telling a story while actual sports aren\u2019t. Because actual sports aren\u2019t scripted.\n\nAlso sport teams do look weak when they lose which is why certain sports teams have the reputation of sucking.",
                "And then some people have been pushed for so long they're bulletproof and can take a shock loss. A la Rock losing The Hurricane or Razor Ramon losing to 1 2 3 Kid. Like everyone else said, not all losses are equal.",
                "As most are saying, losing isn\u2019t bad, but HOW you lose, is the big factor.\n\nBig E lost the WWE title in a 5 way, with Brock being tacked on because Roman caught Covid. Big E never even got a rematch.\n\nYou as a TALENT can be exceptional, but when a company wants to paint you like you aren\u2019t worth a damn, you get people saying your reign \u201csucked.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s all in how you\u2019re presented, treated and booked. \n\nWhen a company wants someone like Roman/Cena at the top, that\u2019s the way it\u2019s going to be, likewise if you\u2019re a Daniel Bryan, Big E, Ziggler or Christian.\n\nLosses don\u2019t break talent, the attitude behind why they are a loss to begin with is another matter entirely.",
                "Mainly because some fans don't understand that losing in a storyline is not a big deal. However, sometimes it's how you lose and how often. If it looks like someone is being wasted and jobbed out, I can understand the mindset that it's bad. But if it's within a story or a way to start/transition into or from a story it can be beneficial. People forget how often Stone Cold Steve Austin lost during his height. He lost fairly often on TV and more than a few PPV's but it really only helped him. And losing to Bret Hart really started his rise. Triple H lost a ton of PPV matches, though a lot of people think he won all the time. Dusty Rhodes for most of his career was a fan favorite who lost big matches a lot. He used to book himself to lose fairly often, especially against Flair and the Horsemen. And when he finally won the title, each reign was very short and he would lose it back pretty quickly.",
                "Because the writing is bad",
                "I want to preface this by saying I don't hate the Detroit Lions at all.  \n\n\nLet's use the Detroit Lions as an example. They've been the laughing stock of the NFL for what, 20 years? Probably longer? Why is that? It's because they keep losing. In fact, they're one of three teams in NFL history to lose every game of the regular season. Historically, they are a bad franchise. (Last season, they seem to have turned it around and I'm excited to watch them this year, but that's a different topic altogether.)    \n\nSo because the Lions have such a long history of losing, nobody takes them seriously.

When he was in the team, they were some of the best years I've had in the Bar\u00e7a first team, we won everything. And, well, he's a very different player to all the others, I'm sure he would bring us a lot, but in the end I'm not the one who decides. So the decision-makers, whether he comes or not, will decide what is best for the club. What we want is to have the best possible team to compete for everything and to have the best players.\n\n>Q: You haven't sent him any WhatsApp so far, have you?\n\n>[Smiles] Well I have spoken to him.\n\n>Q: Have you?\n\n>Yes, yes.\n\n>Q: So what?\n\n>[Laughter].

                "I started powerlifting last year as a 66 year old woman, after a lifetime of exercise (running, yoga, dumbbell workouts). I was feeling frail and scrawny and wanted to change that. I had never touched a barbell before so I was starting from scratch.\n\nI went to a powerlifting/Oly gym to learn, and work with a very experienced coach 3x a week. I do the 3 lifts plus accessories. \n\n*I have never been stronger in my entire life.* I have put on some much-needed weight and actually built some muscle. I competed in a meet in July and had PRs on all 3 lifts: 110 lb squat, 71 lb benchpress, 173 lb deadlift. \n\nFor younger people these numbers might be laughable. But to me they are a testament to excellent coaching and my work ethic. I\u2019m damn proud of how far I have come in a year.\n\nThe huge eye opener for me is how fucking WEAK I was after after literal decades of exercise. That\u2019s because it was \u201cexercise\u201d, not a structured, challenging workout plan with progressive overload. \n\nAnd it is challenging. But powerlifting is hands down THE best thing I have ever done for myself from a health and fitness standpoint. I am so glad I pushed myself out of my comfort zone and got into this sport.\n\nNow I\u2019m 67. If I can do something like this at my age, just think of how much progress someone younger could make in whatever fitness activity they choose. Carpe diem. :-)",

I'm 40 now and having an absolute blast. It's easy to think of martial arts as a meat head hobby but it's super cerebral and you'll actually find a lot of nerds in these gyms  for that reason. \n\nI really love the martial arts community and my gym is my second home. People will check in with me if I haven't trained in a few days. It's just such a good/supportive/healthy community. Everything needs to be rooted in respect when you're simulating murder and there are no lies on the mats.\n\nI also started playing piano during the pandemic. I'm really enjoying these hobbies immensely. I used to switch to up my main hobbies every 5 years but I'm pretty sure I've found my forever hobbies.",

I was in the hospital for 4 days, and laid up for about a month. I had severe PTSD, night terrors, and the emotional stability of a crackhead on a seesaw. I decided I didn't want to die fat.\n\n I had lost weight with a very restrictive diet and a lot of cardio before COVID, but when gyms closed I put it all back on. When they opened again I decided I wanted to lift weights because I remember liking it in highschool. I started going 3 days a week, then 5, then 6 most weeks. Lifting worked way better than therapy. I found out I had low testosterone, got a prescription from my urologist, and started taking 120/wk. I just lifted to shut my brain off. Because I was in the gym at the same time every day, week in week out with complete unwavering consistency, I started to get to know all of the regulars that did the same. I gained an entirely new friend group, I lost 75 lb, gained a bunch of muscle, drastically reduced the impact of my PTSD. \n\nI fell into looking at too much fitness content for a while, but ended up bringing my nerdy passion to the science side of lifting, and my interest in pharmacology into how to achieve the goals I'd set for myself.\n\nI went from having lower back pain so bad I could barely get up in the morning to deadlifting 495lbs. I went from being a fat guy to a meat stick (a older coworker described me as a \"whole ass meat stick\" and I'll never let go of that compliment)  it completely changed my level of confidence and I think it genuinely made me a better person.",

Now, at 42, I bounce around between triathlon training, weightlifting (former competitive powerlifter), and just running. It's so nice to be able to adjust my exercise to what my time and body can handle - shoulder bothering me from lifting? Cut back on lifting and run more. Knees bothering me from running?

Lost 20 pounds of fat with almost no intentional change to my diet (I say intentional because I did change my diet a little bit but it was more because I started realizing that greasy foods and heavy carbs are a good way to feel like crap while lifting, and eating lots of protein and veggies for fiber with healthy fats is basically all I really want to eat after a workout. Because of this, I feel more full and satisfied, so I tend to eat less overall).",

I took only one beginners class and the rest I taught myself with books and YouTube. No I have not made it big or even close, but I definitely enjoy the practice and occasional play.

This summer for the first time I learned how to swim laps without stopping for about 45 min straight.

During the pandemic, I wanted to use the time to get fit and running was the cheapest and most accessible way to get fit at the time. I started out running a quarter mile and then every week I would add a quarter mile to my runs and I would work on speed too. My goal was a 5k in 30 minutes. In the end, I was unable to hit my 5k distance goal because of a knee injury, but my last longest run was 35 minutes. I stopped running long distances but by the end of my training period during that time, I had lost 25 lbs and was in the best shape of my life.

All good things to learn in life :)\n\n Weight lifting: I had never lifted weights in my life until I hit 30. After my running injury I wanted to try something else. I lived alone and wanted to be able to lift things in my house without needing help.

                "Not starting, but actually re-starting skiing is what kind of \"saved\" me earlier this year. Turned 41 at the end of the last year, was about 260 to start this year. I used to be a multi-sport athlete in high school and some of college, was generally pretty good about keeping up with the gym through my late 20s and early 30s, but my diet was trash. The older I got the better I did with diet, but the gym fell by the wayside, especially during Covid. Diet is probably the only reason I never got over 260. Skiing was one of my favorite sports when I was a kid and even into my early college years. I used to race NASTAR and was in multiple ski clubs in college to take advantage of discounted trips. We used to go on 3-4 day excursions and ski from open to night skiing close, shred it all day and just have an awesome time.\n\nLife and moving took me away from the northeast US and in my late 20s/early 30s skiing wasn't really affordable and it fell by the wayside. Then right before New Years my old college buddy calls me up and invites me to go skiing with his family in February of this year. I had about a month to try to get in some kind of \"skiing shape\" so I started walking hills, doing squats, working on core and doing some cardio to try to get ready. We go on the trip and I absolutely fall in love with skiing all over again, and it was like riding a bike from when I was much younger. That 3-day trip turned in to 2 more ski trips in February and March and I was totally hooked on it again. The only problem is that after skiing 2 days in a row my body was completely WRECKED. I had forgot how much of a total body workout it was and I was sore everywhere for days, had trouble walking around after the 2nd day in a row from the soreness and it was the wake up call I needed to get my butt back in the gym.\n\nI decided at that point I was going to start skiing again as much as possible since I could now afford the travel at this point in my life after 40 and it's something I really enjoyed and had missed for a long time. I got back from my last trip at the start of March and just said that when the season opened this November I was going to be back in lean mean ski shape like I was when I raced. I started a lifting program and put together a little home gym with a bench and some dumbbells, got a used spin bike on sale for cheap, and went to work. I was 260 and 26% body fat back in March(I'm 6-4) and as of this week I'm down to 236 and 21%. My goal was to hit 235 in 6 months so I'm a bit ahead of schedule. I walk/run 2-3 miles every day, got my 5k time down around 27 minutes(I think it was almost 40ish minutes the last time I ran one for a charity thing at work in my late 30s), and just feel so much better with a ton more energy every day. Much stronger now starting to now see some really good body comp changes as I get close to the end of 5 months. I feel like I'm in the best shape I've been in since I was 20 and running Cross Country and playing basketball in college. The best part is that since I've been taking it slow(going for 1-2 lbs. weight loss every 2 weeks) it's now become a permanent lifestyle change and I love working out/going to the gym again.",

These cars aren\u2019t designed to run on that for one, and regardless having a 10% ethanol blend automatically gives you less fuel economy and burns faster. It can also really gunk up your injectors, and spark plugs as well not giving you an even clean burn and having wasted fuel. They put that ethanol blend in to try and drop the price per gallon of fuel, even though they\u2019re still raising the prices and it\u2019s not even saving us any money what so ever, it\u2019s wasting it since it gets less miles per gallon and still paying more for it. If you find a station with non ethanol blend fuel, you will get better fuel economy and notice a pretty large increase likely 20-50 miles difference.. and you won\u2019t be damaging or gumming up your injectors and plugs. We even have a gas station in our town that their big sign in front of the station says \u201cNO ETHANOL! BETTER ECONOMY!\u201d",

Hei\u00dft du sagst zum Beispiel Montags mache ich nach der Arbeit das Geschirr (entweder abwaschen vom Wochenende oder Geschirrsp\u00fcler aus- und einr\u00e4umen), Dienstag ist Sport/Hobby dran, Mittwoch ist ein Flextag (suche mir eine Aufgabe aus dem Haushalt heraus nach Laune) usw. \n2. Es muss nicht alles immer fertigwerden. Vielleicht ist ein Donnerstag mal so stressig gewesen auf der Arbeit dass man es nicht mehr schafft sowohl W\u00e4sche reinzuschmei\u00dfen als auch die saubere abzuh\u00e4ngen und wegzur\u00e4umen. Dann macht man eben nur eins und am n\u00e4chsten Tag weiter \n3. Wenn man unter der Woche keine Zeit f\u00fcr Privatleben und Hobbies hat ist es gut die Priorit\u00e4t dort auf den Haushalt zu legen und am Wochenende dann auch wirklich sich die Zeit nehmen f\u00fcr andere Dinge die einem guttun \n4. Homeoffice und Gleitzeit nutzen wo\u2019s m\u00f6glich ist aber am besten mit Struktur, also festen Tagen. In Notf\u00e4llen (Termine bei \u00c4mtern, \u00c4rzten, Kind wird krank etc) kann man das ja anpassen \n5. Egal ob du um 00 Uhr schlafen gehst und um 8 aufstehst oder um 21 Uhr und um 5 raus musst: Niemals direkt nach Aufgabenerledigung ins Bett. Erst eine Stunde oder eine halbe Stunde runterkommen (Eine Folge der Lieblingsserie, noch bisschen ans Handy, einen Tee machen und auf dem Sofa kurz die Stille genie\u00dfen oder oder oder), dann schlafen legen \n6. Hilfe holen. Ich hab wenn es zu schlimm wurde mit einem Freund/einer Freundin oder Verwandten einmal richtig zusammen geputzt und aufger\u00e4umt. Das war mir anfangs so peinlich aber das hat mir am Ende immer eine Chance gegeben es nachher besser zu machen\n\nIch hoffe das hilft hier vielleicht auch noch jemand anderem. Nehmt euch den Druck raus ein perfekt aufger\u00e4umtes Haus haben zu m\u00fcssen oder 4 Mal die Woche zum Sport zu m\u00fcssen oder jedes Wochenende die Freunde treffen zu m\u00fcssen.

                "Eigentlich ganz gut. Ich hab eigentlich keine Zeitprobleme und der einzige Abstrich ist halt die Zeit in der Arbeit (und der Arbeitsweg). Aber irgendwo muss das Geld ja herkommen.\n\nIch steh um 5:20 Uhr auf, bin um 6:15 Uhr in der Arbeit und fahre (Mo.- Do.) um 15 Uhr nach Hause. Bin also gegen 15:45 Uhr entweder zu Hause oder im Gym. Da trainiere ich dann 2 Stunden (inkl. umziehen, aufw\u00e4rmen und duschen) und bin dann kurz vor 18 Uhr zu Hause. Wenn mal Vereinstraining ist, dreht sich Training/Essen vielleicht auch mal um.\n\nViele hier haben meines Erachtens einfach ein mieses Zeitmanagement. Da die wenigsten hier von Kindern oder ihrem Partner reden gehe ich mal davon aus, dass hier viele ebenfalls ein Leben als Single f\u00fchren. \n\nMeine Single Tipps zum Zeit sparen.\n\n* **Einmal in der Woche einkaufen**. Setzt nat\u00fcrlich eine gewisse Planung voraus f\u00fcr 5-7 Tage im Voraus einzukaufen. Und geht sicher auch nicht bei allen Lebensmitteln - bei den meisten allerdings schon.\n* **Gro\u00dfer K\u00fchlschrank**. Das Zeug muss ja auch irgendwo verstaut werden\n* **3 mal kochen** statt jeden Tag. Man kann durchaus an 2 Tagen hintereinander das Gleiche essen. Ist bei den Gr\u00f6\u00dfen, in denen man Lebensmittel einkaufen muss sowieso effizienter. So ein Auflauf schmeckt beim zweiten Mal fast noch besser und bei Gerichten wie H\u00e4hnchen-Curry ist 3 mal essen fast schlauer, weil z.B. 400ml Kokosmilch gef\u00fchlt 5000kcal haben.\n* **Meal-Prep**. Ist nicht nur was f\u00fcr Fitnessfreaks und Bodybuilder. Am Sonntag 1,5 Stunden investieren um sich f\u00fcr die n\u00e4chste Woche 4-5 Mittagessen vorzubereiten ist eine super Sache. Ein selbstgemachtes mariniertes Putenfilet mit Reis und gr\u00fcnen Bohnen schmeckt nicht nur besser als 5 mal Wurst-/K\u00e4sebrot oder der REWE Fertigsalat, es ist auch ges\u00fcnder. 4-5 Gerichte raussuchen und die im Wechsel zubereiten und selbst Ideen einbringen, dann ist auch immer wieder Abwechslung dabei. Ben\u00f6tigt allerdings auch wieder einen gr\u00f6\u00dferen K\u00fchl-/Gefrierschrank.\n* **Sp\u00fclmaschine nutzen**. Beste Erfindung seit dem Rad. Was man sich da an Zeit einspart, steht in keinerlei Relation zu den Kosten.\n\nWie hier schon geschrieben wurde, w\u00fcrde ich auch Freizeitbesch\u00e4ftigungen nach der Arbeit direkt anfahren und nicht erst nach Hause gehen. Sobald man sich auf die Couch setzt, ists vorbei und K\u00f6rper und Geist sind im Erholungsmodus. Zudem ist es ein v\u00f6llig unn\u00f6tiger doppelter Weg, der in der sp\u00e4rlichen Freizeit nur Zeit kostet. \n\nSich was vornehmen ist meines Erachtens auch ein wichtiger mentaler Punkt. Wenn ich am Morgen in die Arbeit fahre, geh ich im Auto schon das Training am Nachmittag im Kopf durch. Da wei\u00df das Unterbewusstsein sofort, um 15 Uhr ist heute noch nicht Schluss. \n\nWas das Thema Waschen/Putzen angeht, das ist dann recht individuell. Aber hier mal eine Auswahl an Dingen, die ich in den letzten 6 Monaten auf Reddit gelesen habe, die meines Erachtens nicht nur v\u00f6llig unn\u00f6tig sind, sie sind auch zeitraubend, Ressourcen verschwendend (so viel zum Thema Klimaschutz) und teilweise wahrscheinlich auch ungesund.\n\n* Jeden Tag den Pyjama wechseln\n* Jeden Tag Waschlappen/Handtuch wechseln\n* Jeden Tag duschen, im Sommer sogar zwei mal\n* Jeden Tag neue Klamotten, wenns warm ist sogar zweimal am Tag\n* Jede Woche die Bettw\u00e4sche wechseln (twl. sogar \u00f6fter)\n* Jede Woche die Wohnung feucht raus wischen bzw. jeden zweiten Tag Staubsaugen\n\nDa wundert mich nicht, dass man f\u00fcr sonst nichts Zeit hat, wenn man schon 5-10 Stunden in der Woche nur mit waschen / trocknen / b\u00fcgeln und putzen besch\u00e4ftigt ist, weil man bei jedem Staubkorn Schnappatmung bekommt. Man kann auch jeden Tag was anderes anhaben und trotzdem nur 2 T-Shirts brauchen (\u00fcberspitzt formuliert). Mal ganz davon abgesehen, dass ich in meiner Wohnung gar nicht gen\u00fcgend Platz h\u00e4tte das ganze Zeug \u00fcberhaupt zu verstauen, kostet dass ja Unmengen an Wasser, Shampoo, Waschmittel und Zeit. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIch halte es f\u00fcr ein bisschen schwierig zu sagen \"ich hab keine Freizeit\", wenn ich als Familie mit einem Kind pro Woche 25 Shirts, 20 Hosen, 25 Sets Unterw\u00e4sche, 3 Bettgarnituren, 20 Waschgarnituren bearbeiten, nebenbei den Haushund- / Katze versorgen muss w\u00e4hrend ich 3 mal pro Woche Staubsauge und jeden Tag was neues koche. Die Arbeit hab ich mir halt auch selbst eingebrockt und ist zu einem gro\u00dfen Teil vermeidbar.",
                "Gute Frage, harte Antwort.\n\nLangsam angefangen.\n\nSobald der Kleine im Bett ist, erst einmal die Woche Sport ca. 30 Minuten. Nach 2 Monaten war ich die Routine gewohnt und habe das dann in diesem Takt auf 3 mal die Woche 40 Minuten gesteigert.\n\nAbends habe ich suksessive Couch und PS gegen Couch und Buch und dann Couch und Lehr- und Sachb\u00fccher getauscht.\n\nParallel zum Sport haben meine Frau und ich einen Date Abend eingef\u00fchrt. Immer etwas mehr in die Richtung die wir wollen, aber noch lange nicht am Ziel.\n\nSchritt f\u00fcr Schritt.\nGeduld mit sich selbst und anderen.\n\nUnd sich daran gew\u00f6hnen das unter der Woche es einfach keine Freizeit gibt sondern nur Hausarbeit und sich selbst am Laufen halten.",
                "Mit Zeitmanagement. Ich habe zwar aktuell keinen Vollzeitjob, aber ich jongliere 24 Stunden Arbeit und Jura Studium nebeneinander, was mich manchmal mehr an meine Grenzen bringt als meine Ausbildung mit ihren 40 Stunden in der Woche. \n\nGrds. Muss man sich halt ganz explizit die Zeit schaffen und das dann aber auch einhalten. Ich habe zB. Jeden Tag von 14.30 bis 16.30 eine feste Pause un mit dem Hund spazieren zu gehen und etwas zu essen, bevor ich zur Arbeit muss. Ich habe ganz feste Zeiten und daran halten ich mich, genauso wie feste Putztage f\u00fcr den Haushalt und die W\u00e4sche. \n\nDann funktioniert das auch gut, ich kann zwar wenig bis kaum irgendwelchen zeitintensiven Hobbies nacheghen aktuell, aber ich schaffen es Mal was mit Freunden zu machen, einen Abend frei zu haben und nicht im Chaos zu versinken.",

Bahn statt Auto spart auch Zeit, weil man alles, was man online oder telefonisch erledigen kann dann auf dem Arbeitsweg abhaken kann. \nRegelm\u00e4\u00dfigkeit hilft auch.

McT is homegrown, a Scottish international, with EL and CL experience and has been a big part of a team that finished 3rd and 2nd consecutively. He\u2019s one of the few players we have who is on low wages and if you look at the prices in this market (especially Gallagher for 40m) there is no reason we should be accepting anything less than 40m for him. We could still get 30 for him next season if the move doesn\u2019t happen and we could use him for depth this season anyway. I get accepting something slightly lower for Maguire because he is so hard to move on with his wages but why not cash in on McT when we can?",
                "Well done - Let's get 70 AT LEAST.",
                "Makes sense. Scott\u2019s still a fine depth piece and while 30mil is decent money I think it\u2019s not enough to make it worth it to lose him and then find a replacement.",
                "yeah people love to clown on mctominay but the club\u2019s valuation is understandable \n\nhis contract doesn\u2019t run out until 2026, he\u2019s on low wages by our standards, is a serviceable squad player, home grown, performs well for his country, and i doubt he would kick up a fuss about leaving \n\ngiven fred and VDB are likely to leave, i\u2019d like to keep mctominay around even if we brought in amrabat \n\nshould definitely accept the maguire offer though lol",

                "People losing their minds over this and I can\u2019t understand why. City are obviously a much better run club than us but they sold a keeper with no prem apps, no international apps, no European apps for 20 mil. Why is it so insane we ask for more than that for established international players?",
                "I'm sure this will look like a brilliant decision this time next year when he's worth 15m",

                "I mean if your not into training physically like they do you can definitely learn more about strategy and technique from watching",
                "The only thing I've ever learned from the Tour was that I'd hate riding behind or adjacent to an internal combustion vehicle all the time.  I would get annoyed by the exhaust smell.",
                "If you like riding in groups sure.\n\nAs a solitary or casual cyclist  not much",
                "Sure there\u2019s some macro level takeaways like managing effort but the reality is, they get paid to ride. All the time, hours on hours.\n\nPractice suffering a lot for a lot of hours and you\u2019re good to go.",
                "I've learned race tactics from watching the tour. Watching how they win from the breakaway, time sprints, etc. have been useful for fast/competitive group rides and some of the team tactics have been useful to me in Zwift races.",
                "Watch when they make a move and how they don\u2019t hesitate. Breaking away in a bike race is one of the hardest things to master and tour riders are the best in the world.",
                "Yeah. A three week suffering and eating contest :-)",
                "Yes you are lucky there aren't a bunch of people running along side you shouting and waving a flag in your face.",
                "I\u2019ve learned a lot about nutrition from the tour. Fuel ever 20-30 min on hills. Definitely once an hour when riding slowly. 30-60g carbs at every fueling. Hydrate! Hydrate! And yes. Endure pain.",
                "Yes you can. Is not all about pain. You can learn a lot. \nYou can look at pedaling technic, getting out of the saddle, gears used, where to sit in the bunch\u2026..etc etc",
                "Cadence ... the cycling term for RPMs, revolutions per minute, of your pedaling. When pros are riding hard and fast on the flats, their cadence may be 85-95 RPMs, and their legs are fluid enough to pedal ROUND pedal strokes, not pushing up/down/up/down. This is a key thing to learn to produce constant power over distance.",
                "I believe the primary takeaway is that which is already understood. Endurance sports are extremely difficult, uncomfortable, if not painful and exhausting in the extreme. The strategies employed, team objectives, road etiquette, and the like most likely means nothing to a typical amateur.",
                "One thing not to mimic or learn is the position they ride their bikes in, they are very flexible with large power output and minimal upper body mass. Don\u2019t try and ride the long, low positions you see in the tour at best you probably be uncomfortable at worse you\u2019ll crash or get injured.",
                "You can learn a little about tactics and formations. I watched pro racing before I had joined any group rides and it helped me know basically where to keep myself, especially in crosswinds.",
                "Eating and drinking on the bike. Can\u2019t tell you how many people I ride with don\u2019t have that habit.",
                "I think anyone can look at Vingegaard and Pogacar and learn a lot about being an absolutely fierce competitor while also being a class act.",
                "One takeaway from TdF is how many calories you burn cycling day after day for 3 weeks and just how important on bike fueling is to prevent you from having a bad day. Or, not recovering well for the next day because you\u2019re in calorific deficit. \nIt also shows how missing your regular meals can lose you time when you need to do VO2 efforts or higher, like Pogacar in 2022 on the Telegraph and Le Col de Galibier.",
                "I think that the cyclists that participate in Tour de France are outliers. Recreational cyclists can learn a thing or two from them but we probably shouldn\u2019t or need to do many of the stuff tho pros are doing. Unless an amateur wants to work towards that level.",
                "You can learn that you are normal and the pros are freaks of nature. Apparently their pain receptors are almost nil.\n\nTim de Clerq, closest pro to my size and weight, hauls along on the lead out at 30+ mph for 40 to 50 miles at a time. I actually held that once for a few miles leading out a local group ride. Operative word here is once. Then fell off the back as I missed the end of the train. But, did have the best lead out time on that ride."

Really nice market i guess, i mean we need depth in the squad but no pure striker and also this midfield is just horrible compated to two years ago or even las year (hope im wrong)\n\nEdit: also Luka is a winger and now Alexis will have to play as defender if he stays cuz we bought way to many wingers",

                "When I bought my first bike, the owner had Dunlop front and Michelin rear. I've heard of people mix and matching tires and it doesn't seem to be a terrible problem, I'd just recommend doing your research first. Some tires are more evenly rounded curve from left to right, where others are more flat in the middle and some are almost \"pointy\" in the middle designed for really whipping into corners having a wider contact patch while cornering. \n\nSo it's not a problem, but it's probably best for you to identify what kind of riding you plan to do and shop accordingly. Both tires take abuse it different ways. Your rear is what powers you,  and the front takes the brunt of your braking. So I wouldn't cheap out on either tire personally.\n\nI'm running front and back Michelin Road 6, my bike is sport-touring and it's wet here 8 to 9 months of the year. That seems to be the best option for me and I'm pretty happy with it. So again, it all comes down to your riding style.",

The speed rating can be found on the side of the tire where the sizing information is. \n\nYou also should refrain from running a mix of radial and bias ply tires on a sport bike, but can in a pinch. Reason being, bias ply are usually stiffer than radial and provide differing amounts of traction.",

If you got a set of tires you really liked the front of but not the rear, you can get a different rear tire and keep the front brand. The reverse is also true.",

                "To elaborate on why it's bad to mix tires, certain tires have different profiles, which can be pointy (Pirelli Diablo Corsa) or round (Michelin Power 5/GP) while BOTH are sport tires made for the track.\n\nSo if you put 1 pointy up front and 1 round in the rear, that's going to mess up the dynamics of turning. \n\nWhy do tires have different profiles? If you want maximum grip while leaned over, you get pointy. But this means a sharp turn in, which is only ideal when you want to be balls out 100% of the time. If you want a gradual turn in and a gradual corner exit, like of you're on the street or encounter turns of carrying sharpness, then a round profile is better. I track my bike but run street, hard, so I ride round profile tires because I get longer life and more consistent turning, which means it's easier to adjust for shit in the road, mid turn, and it's easier for my suspension to work with the tire if I need to lean far over rough surfaces. \n\nIf you're a casual rider it likely doesn't matter, but it's akin to some random car driver who only drives in the sunshine on bald tires. It \"likely doesn't matter\" as long as driving conditions are ok. \n\nWill the tires make you crash? No. But you may have a bike that doesn't steer how it is designed to, which could be an issue down the road. \n\nI'd say to just run them until you need some new ones, keep the pressure where it needs to be, and when you buy new tires, buy sport touring tires that give long highway life while having sticky edges and good wet weather traction.",

                "Zenith",
                "I\u2019ll say Zenith by a mile, but that\u2019s because it would look terrific on a rally (or other) strap, while that\u2019s not possible with the GP, which is why I hate integrated bracelets. I do like the GP\u2019s dial design, though.",
                "Zenith for sure",
                "Zenith by a mile. Superior movement, history, love the tri-color dials, ceramic bezel. Watch is sick.",
                "Zenith. Absolutely the Zenith!",
                "I'd usually choose any GP three hander over a Zenith one (except if it had something unmatched like Zenith's cal. 135), but when it comes to chronographs it's Zenith any day of the week and twice on Sunday.\n\nThe GP has a modular chronograph movement (with the base GP3300 caliber) whereas the Zenith is an integrated construction. Add to that how many decades the El Primero movement has proven itself as robust/reliable and accurate, and its iconic status (and the fact that most of its history it's been the only 10bps integrated chronograph).\n\nGranted, the GP might have a tad better decoration and finish with the movement, but you're not going to see it anyway with the solid caseback.",
                "Zenith for me. I respect both watches but both are too inspired by others pieces for me to be a buyer \u2014 who am I to talk tho I own a bb58 haha. My pops has a zenith open and it\u2019s amazing so can vouch for zenith",

                "Idk man The Laureato is so freaking sweet",
                "The Zenith is hands down the best looking chrono I've seen, including this GP",
                "Zenith El Primero had great movement/history and the absolute ugliest subdials of any chrono I\u2019ve ever seen. Why they jam the subdials so close together I will never, ever understand.\n\nGet the Laureato.",
                "The one you can put on any strap, which is also the one giving the Daytona a tough run for its money",
                "I would choose the GP. If you would ask me about the zenith chronomaster original, I would say zenith, but I really don't like that chrono sport. It looks so much like a Daytona which I also really dislike.",
                "Zenith, obviously.",
                "Laureato hands down",
                "I like the chronomaster more. That GP is like any other watch nowadays. Chronomaster has great movement, character, more beautiful (imo) and the 1/10 is awesome",
                "Zenith. That\u2019s probably the best looking chrono dial I\u2019ve ever seen.",
                "Zenith all the way",
                "Zenith.",
                "I'd say zenith. I like the GP in the 3 hander. It has a sleek look and overall better design. Adding a chrono complication takes that away.",
                "I love the El Primero so that's always my choice",
                "Zenith no contest",
                "The GP at least has a useful chronograph function,  more elaborate dial and more legible subdials. Zenith's 10th of a second gimmick would've been ok for special models, not as a default chrono movement .  Zenith looks better tough",
                "Zenith all day",
                "I am in LOVE with that Zenith",
                "GP. \nLove the Zenith but the GP is a step above.",
                "Zenith!",
                "That zenith though\u2026.",
                "Zenith, no questions asked",
                "Well I would say that you have now had the GP watch for a while. If during that time it has not given you the feeling of it being the right watch for you, then I guess you should switch to the Zenith. Since you are thinking about doing the trade - I would assume that you feel like the GP could leave your collection. Then the right choice is going through with the trade I guess.",
                "I\u2019ve been considering that same Zenith. No hesitation, I\u2019d pick it over the GP",
                "Zenith!",
                "Go all the way, the zenith looks like a toy watch imho",
                "Just based on visual - GP stands out, Zenith looks like a LOT of others.",
                "I'll be different and say GP.\n\nThe Zenith is fine.",
                "Honestly the Gp grows on me more and more every time I see it. It\u2019s clearly RO influenced, but I think they\u2019ve executed it well. \n\nThat said, the zenith is always a classic, and ceramic bezel can give daytona vibes if that\u2019s what you\u2019re after. And zenith had a great chrono caliber, not that GP doesn\u2019t. \n\nI\u2019d probably go GP",
                "GP. Have had significant wrist time with both and now own the Blue version of that GP. Love it.",
                "Zenith>>>",
                "GP all the way",
                "Help me out everyone. I currently have the GP and I love it. But I've lusted after the Zenith since it's release. I have a trade offer pending for a Zenith. Which watch would you prefer and why? I feel like the GP certainly has more exclusivity but in my parts I won't see either anywhere ever so that's a non issue.  Im drawn to Zenith quite a bit but there's no denying the GP is classic and super cool.  I'd miss the thinness of the GP but the dial of the Zenith seems to pop more. Help me decide!",
                "It all depends on you. Both are incredible watches. I personally would go with the GP. I\u2019ve never been a fan of the tri color on the Zenith.",
                "GP Laureato Chrono is a tier above and more expensive as well. Unless cash is added I wouldn\u2019t do it personally.",
                "I know this is unsolicited advice, but the newest releases from Tag HEUER are frigging SWEEEET.",
                "Taste is subjective I know but man that zenith is hideous the tri color is so jarring",
                "Who the hell needs to time something to 1/100th of a second that's going to rely on a wristwatch? I'd much rather a chronograph be able to measure more than just 60 minutes. GP by a mile.",
                "Zenith but the GP loos sexy af on that wrist",
                "Speedmaster",
                "Sounds like you need a friend with the Zenith to swap with",
                "Are you serious? There is no other choice but Zenith here.",
                "That GP is sweeeet",
                "GP no question",
                "I honestly think both of them look ugly, but gun to my head? I'd go for the GP.",
                "That GP looks like ass.",
                "I like GP best and I'm not a big fan of quartz movements which many zeniths are",
                "Both trash",
                "If you can swap watches brand names on dials, which one will you choose?",
                "Vote for zenith, integrated bracelet is a dealbreaker for me.",
                "Just buy the white daytona.",
                "Zenith is more unique and I don't like the blue accents or subdial texture on the GP.",

                "Zenith",
                "zenith",

                "Zenith",
                "Which do you prefer on the wrist in terms of fit? I haven\u2019t tried either on but I am leaning toward the Zenith.",
                "Zenith without a doubt for me.",
                "No one is going to give you cut-eye for choosing the GP, but that Zenith is something else altogether.",
                "Zenith hands down.",
                "I really like the three different colored dials on the Zenith!",
                "Zenith all day long.",
                "GP",
                "Clearly the Zenith. It's about 532 times as cool.",
                "Zenith El Primero without question. Personally I'd chose the classic model over the sport one.",
                "I'd go GP. The most original RO alternative. The zenith looks like a daytona  which i respect. But let's be honest, is boring.",
                "I love my go but for a chrono I gotta say zenith.",
                "I\u2019d take that Zenith over a Daytona. Or at least take the Daytona, sell it, and buy the Zenith and pocket the change. Just me though. And I\u2019ve never handled either watch, so take whatever I say with zero credibility.",
                "Here come the downvotes but IDGAF. The Zenith is great, but it's just a very nice Daytona knockoff.",
                "Zenith",
                "Zenith 100% !!! How is that even a question.",

                "I like both and own both, they are and wear differently, Zenith sporty whole GP more casual but you can dress up or down. Zenith movement operates at a high 36K VPH so more wear and tear and I'm hearing service fees ain't no joke.",
                "Zenith subdials overlap. This should be forbidden.",
                "The GP is probably a bit more superior on paper, but the Zenith is way more than the sum of its parts!",
                "I like the gp but he wants to be a AD Royal Oak to much.\nThe Daytona wants to be a El Primero.",
                "Zenith all the way!",
                "As an owner of the Zenith, and having tried on the GP, Zenith.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI love the Zenith so much, and it is even more beautiful in person. Get lots of compliments on it too (if you care about that), from watch and non-watch people alike.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThough, I will echo that the bracelet is a little janky for a watch of its price...",

The forces involved are the exact same forces that the components are made to take when the engine is powering acceleration. The components don't know the difference, and you'll make your brakes last longer, especially if you're doing long downhills like coming out of the mountains - all that heat buildup from constantly holding the brakes partially engaged is really hard on them.",

The computer will rev match for you, and it won't do anything stupid enough to damage parts.\n\nOlder cars with mechanical throttles and automatic transmissions should be very careful with \"manual downshifts.\" Downshifts with the shifter should be done under load, accelerating slightly.  Coasting downshifts on an older automatic transmission cause a lot of wear on the clutch packs.",

                "Absolutely nothing wrong with engine braking, it's actually good practice.\n\nHowever.. DO NOT use the clutch and the engines braking as a replacement for your actual brakes.. Brakes are substantially cheaper and easier to replace than a clutch.",
                "Not statistically significant,  sample size of one, but with my 2015 Toyota sienna, I used the sport shift for downhills constantly as I've always owned manuals prior. First auto and thought it was a great feature up until the transmission took a dump at around 80,000kms. Thankfully I'd negotiated the extended power train warranty when we bought it and it was covered. \n\nNo idea if all the sport mode use contributed to the failure, but apparently these transmissions are typically very reliable. Never used it to tow. \n\nAgain, could have just been a lemon transmission,  but I'm not risking it with the new one.",
                "Its just makes for a rougher ride for your passengers. They don't know when you are shifting so its more jarring as bang up and down.

                "Absolutely not! You'll stretch the bands out in that transmission eventually, usually only takes about 3 months of doing it every day, and next thing you know you're paying $3,500 for a new transmission, well an LKQ transmission, it won't be new.",

For 99% of the time it is wasting brake pads for no reason. \n\nTalking always about sport bikes with big engines, or nakeds which have massive torque. Otherwise, waste of pads for no reason.

A lot of consumer cars are built with budget and fuel economy in mind and parts fail in the real world all the time.  Fixing an easy to get to cheap part is better than a cheaper hard to get to part.  Some people drive vehicles with this in mind.  Even when a vehicle has a warranty the issue of wear in components may not come right away, possibly after the warranty expires.

While diving, I've found tons of Apple Watches, and they always have the sport band. So far this summer, I've found five Apple Watches. Two didn't work, one was in Lost Mode and I returned it to the owner, and the other two had no passcode and no identifiable information.  The Apple Watch in the pic above was found yesterday.  It was one of the watches that didn't have a passcode. I couldn't find any phone numbers on it or useful personal info so I probably won't be able to find who it belongs to.\n\nIf you're going to swim with your Apple Watch on, don't wear the sport band. Don't wear a sport band if you're boating or jet skiing either, since the watches I found were very far out in deep water and probably didn't come from regular swimmers. If you do lose your watch, put it in lost mode and hope someone finds it.",

So yeah i totally agree with you OP. I went without a watch for 2 years then I bought one used off my old friend. I couldn\u2019t justify buying a new one after i did that, i basically punished myself for losing a brand new series 5 and being reckless/careless with an expensive device. \n\nI use the solo loop now, my favorite band ever.

Everyone on the planet that knows soccer understands and gets what Marcos Alonso and Sergi Roberto can do and what they can\u2019t do. Dest still young for a defensive player and can still get better. Even if he can\u2019t improve offensively, he will get smarter and better at positioning himself defensively with reps and time. Maybe I\u2019m wrong and Dest won\u2019t improve anymore and this is who he is for the rest of his career, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m wrong.",

Like, how do you expect to perform when your boss is that actively hostile to you and who has kept you away from the team for nearly a year?

I happened to be in Salt Lake City visiting relatives with my folks.  The Stars were hosting a \"meet & greet\" at the Salt Palace and any fan who showed up and sank 7/10 free throws won a free ABA rubber basketball.  I talked my uncle into taking me and with Bill Sharman watching, I sank seven free throws in a row.  Sharman shook my hand, gave me a ball, and said, \"Nice shooting kid\".  When we got back to the house, my cousin wanted a ball too.  So we went back and with so many people there, they reduced the number of shots you had to make to 2/3.  I stepped up, hit two in a row, and walked off with a ball for my cousin.  Good times.\n\n\nThe NBA added the 3-point line from the ABA.

But considering his role will likely be even more free-form this season, I think there's an argument that it would be too much all in one go. Let him concentrate on perfecting that role first. \n\nIt's definitely a question of when, not if with Trent though. And if he did get it, I think he'd respond similarly to Gerrard getting it at 23. For me though, I would have VVD or Robbo as captain for a couple years then hand it over when Trent is settled in his role and 110% ready.",

It\u2019s clear, as it has always been, morals can be bought. Is Henderson wrong? That is quite subjective, and an answer I cannot give.

At this point, it's better Al-Ettifaq pays whatever LFC is asking for and we part as amicably as possible.

I\u2019m mean, I\u2019m not sure at all how they generate that wage bill but the normal people and business\u2019 of Saudi aren\u2019t the problem it\u2019s the anti competitive Impact of clubs that need no profit. I\u2019m still disappointed but it reads to me closer to joining an mls side owned by an evil billionaire than joking a city/psg/Newcastle situation.

            "title": "The Efficacy of Dual-Sport Bikes for \u201cTactical\u201d Use (see description)",
            "selftext": "I preface this by saying I\u2019m looking at getting a dual-sport bike for \u201ctactical\u201d use and I\u2019ve been looking at the Kawasaki KLR650 (pictured above), but I wish it was a little zippier so if you have any recommendations I\u2019d be thankful for them. Now, let\u2019s continue with the post. \n\n**Possible Pros:**\nIt seems pretty obvious to me that dual-sport bikes (or other kinds of bikes for that matter) would be pretty useful for \u201ctactical\u201d or \u201cSHTF\u201d use. Whether you are solo (bad idea) or have a group, a bike seems to be a pretty solid force multiplier. On their face, bikes are fairly quick and nimble. Quite simply, bikes can go where a lot of trucks, SUVs, cars, and even quads can\u2019t. Roads, backroads, trails, and even through the woods and brush, bikes can offer a step up in capability. Many bikes are also pretty easily modifiable, and the KLR as shown above is pretty modular and would be able to carry a fairly decently sized load. \n\n**Possible Drawbacks:**\nThe biggest drawback I see is their carrying capacity. Bikes obviously can\u2019t carry as much as a truck, SUV, car, or even a quad. So what you can bring on the bike is quite limited, which means if you\u2019re alone (again, you shouldn\u2019t be) then you really can\u2019t carry much of your gear with you. Another problem (which is related to weight) is that dual-sport bikes aren\u2019t the fastest, and the more weight you add the slower they accelerate, top out at, and it also can greatly affect your gas mileage. The too speed may be a non-problem, but if you\u2019re trying to carry as much gear as you can along with you and you find yourself cruising on a road at fairly high speeds for a little while, you may find that your gas mileage suffers. Additionally, they are a little more risky to ride than something like a car or truck which is more survivable should an accident occur. Additionally, weather may play a role in their viability. If you live in an area that gets snow, bikes become a lot more risky. Severe rain may also make bike travel impossible or too dangerous to use, whereas with other travel methods these are not as much of a concern. But, if you use bikes in conjunction with other vehicles like trucks or SUVs, there are some ways around this and you could simply throw the bike in the back of a truck and hop in with the truck (more on this later). Those are the main issues I see. \n\n\n**Possible Use-Cases:**\n I see the bike shining with their utilization with recon or scout elements. Their small, compact nature and off-road capability (again assuming a dual-sport bike) allows them to quickly navigate streets as well as quickly navigate off-road areas where it may be possible to drive instead of hike. Additionally, compared to their larger relatives like trucks, SUVs, and cars, they are much more easily concealable should you have to dump them at a rally point, ORP, etc. Another idea would be to send a couple guys on bikes and or quads ahead of your larger convoy which could consist of trucks, SUVs, that carry the heavier supplies and more people while you essentially scout the area in front for ambushes, blockades, or any other possible problems. They would essentially act as an early warning system while the remainder/bulk of the \u201cconvoy\u201d could act as a QRF should the front guys need it. You could play with the distance, but lets say even if they are a mile ahead I could see this being pretty beneficial for the team. \n\nAdditionally, if you are lacking radio comms (or the distance for communication or too great for handheld radios and you don\u2019t have access to a larger unit), then you could send a bike over to relay commands, information, organization, or any other administrative task(s). It could be because the distance between the groups is non-permissive for larger vehicles or because the distance is too great to walk should you need to convey information in a relatively quick manner. Obviously how they are implimented depends entirely on METT-TC factors, I don\u2019t see all too many downsides. \n\n**Conclusion:**\nI\u2019m sure there are many more possible and creative use-cases, this is just what I came up with on the top of my head as I think about this. If you have more possible use-cases for a bike, feel free to drop them. I\u2019m pretty interested in this topic at the moment. Quads also have their place as well, and of course so do trucks, SUVs, and cars as mentioned several times already. What do you guys think?",

I thought it was great in concept. We would use bikes and quads to transport ammo and food where our trucks couldn\u2019t go. They were great for those roles but they did have some big drawbacks.\n\nFirst, wearing kit while riding isn\u2019t impossible, but it throws your balance all to shit. Trying to keep a rifle slung on your front really limits how much you can lean into turns, which slows you down. So minimal kit and no rifle is pretty much how we rode. \n\nAnother big issue I didn\u2019t really see you mentioned is **noise.** People don\u2019t understand how far that noise travels in woods when it\u2019s otherwise quiet. We had multiple scenarios were our ADFOR had been setup in an ambush for 10 minutes by the time we rolled through. \n\nThey can be a great tool but make sure you\u2019re aware of their drawbacks when using them.

The KLR really did NOT shine compared to the stroms at acceleration, speed, and gas mileage.\n\nWe all had our bikes loaded down to the brim, I mean enough stuff to last us four months to include spare tires, chains, sprockets etc. So I think unless you\u2019re carrying a camp van worth of crap you\u2019d be alright. \n\nAs for weather and terrain considerations, yeah definitely more limited than cars/trucks but also can be mitigated to some degree if you have the right equipment specifically PPE and tires. Tires I found made a huge difference, even going from 70/30 to a 60/40 or even 50/50 will change your ride dramatically. \n\nLast point was gas mileage fully loaded on the strom still wasn\u2019t bad at all, better than you\u2019ll get with any truck/car imo. Of course you\u2019re sacrificing a few things. We also kept a 1 Gal jerry can on our bikes in case it got sticky.\n\nEdit: \nNot trying to sell you a V-Strom lol, I was just on a college budget and it\u2019s all I could afford. I\u2019m positive there are even better bikes out there. I particularly like the looks of the KTM dual sport, yet much out of my budget.",
                "Here's a promo video from my Friend Jimmy's company Tactical Mobility Training. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/9VYGdFLrnRk\n\nTake notice of the bikes. They are using Cristini all wheel drive kits on what is basically a Honda crf450. Even without the all wheel drive kit a stock crf450l or a yamaha wr450 or klx or whatever is going to be very capable. The relevant issue here is the small size and light weight. \n\n\nA small light bike is going to be more nimble in tight technical terrain yet still capable of 80-90mph on the open road. Wearing full kit and a rifle on a bike is not easy, it makes you top heavy, throws the balance off and just generally impedes your ability to execute technical maneuvers even for compentent riders. A crf450 comes in under 300lbs wet and a Africa twin for example is pushing 550lbs. That's a big difference when it comes time to pick that bike up considering in a tactical situation almost every time you dismount your putting the bike on its side to lower its profile. If you need to gtfo in a hurry or your picking it up after a crash where maybe your banged up a bit you'll be thankful for a lighter bike. Additionally, one man manipulation is a must. What I mean is you need to be able to physically drag that bike over a downed tree or through a ravine, by yourself. \n\n\nOpen road top speed is really not that important. The strength of a bike is being able to go places other vehicles cannot. Unless your being chased there is no reason to be traveling down the open road at top speed. You have near zero situational awareness at that speed as it starts to take all your focus to operate the vehicle. Even if you are being chased you should be looking for opportunities to exploit your advantages over the pursuing vehicle and open road top speed is not your strong suit. \n\n\nIn a shtf scenario or a tactical situation a bike can be a valuable tool. Which bike you choose is highly dependent on its intended purpose. Something nimble for gridlock city traffic in a bug out scenario? Maybe I'm leaning to adventure bike. A go anywhere work horse that will spend its life in the woods climbing hills? Maybe I'm looking at a Rokon. A good balance between the two though is going to be a small engine enduro. Wr, crf, klx, drz, exc, all good choices. Just my 2 cents.",
                "More bugout than \"tactical\" but I saw this dude in town once with a cool setup.  \n\n\nHe was riding a KLR-ish looking bike and towing a long skinny trailer. Guessing the trailer was custom since I haven't found anything like it and it had to be pretty light.   \nOn the trailer he had a couple of plastic totes, a cooler, a whole Rokon, and a Kayak.   \nI'm sure he wasn't going to be hitting any highways like but I thought it was pretty cool as an idea for getting a lot of equipment down trails. If you built your setup right you could probably pack an inflatable raft or canoe with outrigger that would let you move all your gear across bodies of water too.",

            "title": "The Efficacy of Dual-Sport Motorcycles in \u201cTactical\u201d or \u201cSHTF\u201d Scenarios",
            "selftext": "I preface this by saying I\u2019m looking at getting a dual-sport bike for \u201ctactical\u201d use and I\u2019ve been looking at the Kawasaki KLR650 (pictured above), but I wish it was a little zippier so if you have any recommendations I\u2019d be thankful for them. Now, let\u2019s continue with the post. \n\n**Possible Pros:**\nIt seems pretty obvious to me that dual-sport bikes (or other kinds of bikes for that matter) would be pretty useful for \u201ctactical\u201d or \u201cSHTF\u201d use. Whether you are solo (bad idea) or have a group, a bike seems to be a pretty solid force multiplier. On their face, bikes are fairly quick and nimble. Quite simply, bikes can go where a lot of trucks, SUVs, cars, and even quads can\u2019t. Roads, backroads, trails, and even through the woods and brush, bikes can offer a step up in capability. Many bikes are also pretty easily modifiable, and the KLR as shown above is pretty modular and would be able to carry a fairly decently sized load. \n\n**Possible Drawbacks:**\nThe biggest drawback I see is their carrying capacity. Bikes obviously can\u2019t carry as much as a truck, SUV, car, or even a quad. So what you can bring on the bike is quite limited, which means if you\u2019re alone (again, you shouldn\u2019t be) then you really can\u2019t carry much of your gear with you. Another problem (which is related to weight) is that dual-sport bikes aren\u2019t the fastest, and the more weight you add the slower they accelerate, top out at, and it also can greatly affect your gas mileage. The too speed may be a non-problem, but if you\u2019re trying to carry as much gear as you can along with you and you find yourself cruising on a road at fairly high speeds for a little while, you may find that your gas mileage suffers. Additionally, they are a little more risky to ride than something like a car or truck which is more survivable should an accident occur. Additionally, weather may play a role in their viability. If you live in an area that gets snow, bikes become a lot more risky. Severe rain may also make bike travel impossible or too dangerous to use, whereas with other travel methods these are not as much of a concern. But, if you use bikes in conjunction with other vehicles like trucks or SUVs, there are some ways around this and you could simply throw the bike in the back of a truck and hop in with the truck (more on this later). Those are the main issues I see. \n\n\n**Possible Use-Cases:**\n I see the bike shining with their utilization with recon or scout elements. Their small, compact nature and off-road capability (again assuming a dual-sport bike) allows them to quickly navigate streets as well as quickly navigate off-road areas where it may be possible to drive instead of hike. Additionally, compared to their larger relatives like trucks, SUVs, and cars, they are much more easily concealable should you have to dump them at a rally point, ORP, etc. Another idea would be to send a couple guys on bikes and or quads ahead of your larger convoy which could consist of trucks, SUVs, that carry the heavier supplies and more people while you essentially scout the area in front for ambushes, blockades, or any other possible problems. They would essentially act as an early warning system while the remainder/bulk of the \u201cconvoy\u201d could act as a QRF should the front guys need it. You could play with the distance, but lets say even if they are a mile ahead I could see this being pretty beneficial for the team. \n\nAdditionally, if you are lacking radio comms (or the distance for communication or too great for handheld radios and you don\u2019t have access to a larger unit), then you could send a bike over to relay commands, information, organization, or any other administrative task(s). It could be because the distance between the groups is non-permissive for larger vehicles or because the distance is too great to walk should you need to convey information in a relatively quick manner. Obviously how they are implimented depends entirely on METT-TC factors, I don\u2019t see all too many downsides. \n\n**Conclusion:**\nI\u2019m sure there are many more possible and creative use-cases, this is just what I came up with on the top of my head as I think about this. If you have more possible use-cases for a bike, feel free to drop them. I\u2019m pretty interested in this topic at the moment. Quads also have their place as well, and of course so do trucks, SUVs, and cars as mentioned several times already. What do you guys think?",

But I have seen the Olympics, and heard the overall world records are usually held by men, and have heard the high school soccer teams have beaten the women's USA team, and the top female tennis pro tennis sisters admitted they are in the 400's for overall rank. So I don't need to watch it to know it's not as good. People like to watch the best there is, not the best in an individual category. If there was a number 1 female golfer that was better than the men they would be on top. But we have to adjust for their gender to get them publicity. Do you know who the 399 men in from of the Williams sisters are? Do you know the name of the high school students that beat the USA women's soccer team? No? That's gender discrimination advancing women so ply because they are women. They should be happy they have the ability to play on a team that gets any attention at all.",

There\u2019s no denying that men are biologically faster and stronger but i think women\u2019s sport can be interesting and people just love to shit on it without giving it a fair shot.\n\nAlso, there are some sports that women are better at.

At my workplace, that\u2019s all they have been talking about recently, idk too much about it but I think that our team is called the matildas and Sam Kerr is a legend.

In men's football this would have led to an honouring of the team by the mayor. Which the mayor wanted to do with the women's team now as well, in the city centre. But it eventually didn't happen because the men's team had been playing so badly they thought celebrating the women's team would be unfair and make them feel bad about their own failure.",
                "Personally, I don't hate women's sports. I just don't find it enjoying. Maybe professional leagues are different, but when I go to my school to watch the women's league soccer team I simply don't find it enjoying. Normally, all I see is one team dominating and the other doing poorly. Nothing in-between. For the mens team, I see the ball going back and forth. The goal seems more well earned and it's not just a one sided fight.\n\nMaybe that's just local sports, and I'm not a big sports watcher anyways (just have family in local stuff), but yeah. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the National women's leagues are great and definitely way better than me. Just, using the minor leagues as an example, they wouldn't seem that interesting.",

There are strict limits on what days you can practice, how many hours a day, and what time of day you can start practice. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOur marching band currently far exceeds all of these limits and it is still barely enough time to prepare a good show for competition. To be blunt, if we could only practice whenever the football team was practicing our competition show would be a hot mess.",

A sport means there is a point value, competition involved etc.\n\nI put it in the same category as gymnastics and figure skating. They are performing arts with choreography that can be done on their own as a performance OR in competition as a sport. \n\nIt is not black and white, there is definitely a gray area.",
                "Yes! \n\nDrills, running laps, and conditioning us to prepare for the season!\n\nOverall, marching band is a sport...",

                "My highschool considered it a sport because of weird bus policies, liability, and probably more reasons. But honestly it changed nothing actually. Whenever someone not in MB heard it was considered a sport. They'd rant about it saying walking around with instruments is not a sport. Kinda funny. \n\nAnyway, marching band is more than a sport and more valuable too. One thing I enjoy every summer is seeing drum corps. It's amazing what they put on. Yes it's competitive, and like a sport. But there's also the art aspect, when I watch the shows. I see the wonderful pieces of art they put together and enjoy all of it. Not \"GO team\".\n\n\nI like marching, this fall is likely my last season.",
                "Yes it exudes physical activity, we work harder than the football team, etc. It doesn't matter that we don't do head-to-head competition, it's still a sport.",
                "It a feature on FloSports, DCI, BOA, and WGI are considered sporting organizations, BandShoppe is considered a sporting goods website, Comps are treated as Sporting Events, many dictionaries clasify \"Sport\" as an activity that requires physical exertion, competitive relations, and a team format all 3 of which Marching Band (and indoor groups) meet... so I think the evidence is substantial Marching Band, even though officially called a Performing Art it is most definitely A sport",
                "Marching band is a sport to an extent, u do have to be somewhat athletic to be in a marching band and u compete in it as u would if u where in football but it\u2019s no where near as athletic as football or baseball. So yes but barely.",
                "Yes.",
                "I would say no. Despite being physically active you in no way need to be athletic in order to participate and prosper. That\u2019s a key part of a sport, at least in my eyes.",
                "luckily my school district labels it as an athletic and it counts as a pe credit. you also need a physical and you need to be cleared by the athletic training staff to participate",
                "At my school it is. There are two health/fitness  classes one is for your average person and the other is foe pwoplw who participate in sports, marching band kids are in the special sports one.",
                "Nah. \n\nWe are, by definition, a performing arts program. While yeah, physically, we work hard and are required to do a lot, doesn't mean we should be classified as a sport. \n\nI think of it like Cheer, Dance, or Ballad. They do probably way more physically work than most sports, but their athleticism is in the pursuit of perfecting their craft. \n\nIf you aren't so sure about this, ask your schools cheer team how the last competition went and how the rehearsal is going. I almost guarantee they will be happy you even know they compete and be just as excited to tell you about it. \n\nFor most of us, Band is our world, and we just want validation that our passion is well spent. However, like most things in life, once you leave that circle, no one really cares even if you were at the very top. Even with tradition sports.",

We've won just as many trophies as them in their Klopp era and Caicedo grew up with us winning league and CL titles while Liverpool were slipping.\n\nYou can easily say \"any player would jump to join Chelsea and play at the Bridge\" plus accolades such as London and a more decorated career if the last two decades is anything to go by.",

If I was Brighton I'd find Liverpool more favorable too because after negotiating for months only to continuously low ball would be a bit annoying comparitively.\n\nHaving said that fuck Brighton and their holier than thou stance. All they wanted was more money, not professionalism. Even their deadline was timed to favor a new party. And fuck Liverpool too for trying to be sneaky. I'm glad this board has teeth and vindictiveness to go after Caicedo and Lavia to spite them. I think Adams was our second target but Liverpool's shenanigans (which they are entitled to) left a bad taste making us go for Lavia. \n\nGlad to have embarassed both these clubs acting as if they are doing God's work while just doing opportunistic business. 30m overpay was worth it. This guy can go cry a river on talk shows when someone more ambitious and opportunistic comes around. Imagine he has 10s of millions more in the company account and still is trying to act smart.

They couldn\u2019t have done anymore, they were superb and professional throughout.\n\nBut then it comes down to the player.

                "Fun things to know about the Cardinals:\n\n- In terms of World Series wins, they have 11 total, most recently 2011, good for 1st in the National League and 2nd in all of MLB (behind the New York Yankees)\n\n- the 2022 season was the final season for two star players, Albert Pujols and Yadier Molina. Molina played his entire career in St Louis and was notable for his fantastic defense behind the plate. (he was also the unofficial team captain, if we\u2019re being honest here) Albert Pujols played in St Louis from 2001 to 2011 where he was a perennial MVP candidate (and won a couple of times) and returned to STL for his final season and joined the 700 homerun club, which has only been done four times.\n\n- the team has a long-standing rivalry with the Chicago Cubs that goes back to the late 1800s. The rivalry is up there with the Yankees/ Red Sox rivalry.\n\n- David Freese. 2011 World Series, Game 6.",
                "In terms of players to follow or support, the two biggest stars on the team are Paul Goldschmidt and Nolan Arenado, our first and third basemen. Both are very good hitters, though Goldschmidt is starting to show signs of age. Historically the Cardinals have been a great organisation, with some great players. Albert Pujols, Rogers Hornsby, and Stan Musial are probably the best, but there have also been a ton of Hall of Famers on the team besides those three.",
                "Well, if you have other obligations in October, then you picked the right team to follow this season.",
                "[This video](https://youtu.be/e2qbybO7EKo) is a little corny, but it\u2019s a good introduction to Cardinals\u2019 history up to the mid-80\u2019s. The Cardinals are historically the second best franchise in MLB.",
                "Cardinals are one of the most storied franchises in baseball history and the most successful NL team in history. They have won 11 World Series titles which is second only to the Yankees. They have some legendary players that have played for them like Stan Musial, Bob Gibson, Ozzie Smith, Lou Brock, and Albert Pujols to name a few. If you're gonna be a Cardinal fan, you gotta believe that Yadi is a Hall of Famer. Honestly, a good choice of you want a low-key team, but we are in a rare season where we aren't at least a playoff contender (2007 was the last season where we lost more games than we won, which is really impressive) so stick with it through the end of the season and just enjoy watching one of the most fun to watch 3B in Nolan Arenado and the defending MVP in Paul Goldschmidt. There are some other exciting players to watch like Nolan Gorman, Jordan Walker, and Lars Nootbaar, but the two aforementioned are currently the best two on the team.",

The US has been so dominant that people have become disinterested as winning is just expected, and not really celebrated.\n\nIt's a good thing for women's soccer for there to be multiple teams who are competitive. It makes for a better entertainment product, and it also helps expand the game to more countries. It also forces the US women to improve their development practices which will make the USWNT better in the long run.",

                "In theory it should, but the US has a backward approach to development that favors access to people who can pay exorbitant fees to play. This translates to football being mostly accessible rich, white kids and families who rarely grow up in a proper footballing culture.\n\nRight now, for all the pay-to-play programs that exist, we don\u2019t even have solidarity payments to developing clubs in the US, so MLS and NWSL clubs poach players for their academies and pay ZERO to the community clubs.\n\nWhile these things were said back 15 years ago, the biggest difference is we see a change in footballing nations approach to women\u2019s development. When that started to seriously happen, it was only a matter of time that we would hit a wall in a tournament. We have pissed away the 50 or so years Title IX has given us in the women\u2019s game and ignored major technical and tactical developments to favor the same athletic and fast players most of our sports favor.\n\nI think if you want a better idea of how this will play out, we should check out the approach the DFB will take to youth and national team development as opposed to the USSF on the heels of their eliminations.",

So a humbling and more parity should hopefully help drive the overall game to new heights.",
                "As an American grass roots coach, it's annoying how, even as a coach, it's so obvious that our problem isn't \"skill\" persay, as much as simply knowing how to pass the ball effectively. We have no concept of how to use the midfields in the center just outside of the line as a pivot. We looked scared under the press, in the past we were able to rely on simply athleticism.\n\nAlso, I think it's wrong to say \"everyone just caught up\" and the \"title IX is to blame\" because it doesn't given proper credit to the players who achieved what they did. They were incredible, generational talents.\n\nThis isn't a problem solved by a single coach, ball movement has to be taught from 11-12 up (and potentially ealrier). I think we are getting there, but the upper levels are pretty awful and it isn't easy teach without a culture that understands it.\n\nTo answer your question, I hope it's good for the sport, but I naturally hope it's good for women's sport in the US still as well. Women players should not be discouraged, we have robust soccer programs everywhere.",

With so many other countries raising the bar not only closing the gap the USA, Germany, & only a handful of others have had the last 10 years, but also matching and surpassing those teams it means more opportunities for these athletes to not only improve their game individually, but will also provide better chances for them all top to bottom to get paid like they should wo being reliant on their respective nations football associations to subsidize their leagues. Or in the NWSLs case having several of those athletes work 2nd jobs in addition to their athletic job.

This year we struggled against Viet-nam scoring 3 goals. Portugal won 2:0 & the Dutch 7:0 against Viet-nam. We played poor all tournament.\n\nThat said, winning is always better against stiff competition. A 1:0 match feels more earned than 13:0. The competition is welcomed and a sign that we need to re-double our efforts to compete. Nothing is automatic. IMHO... Playing the past 8 years with that winner's badge on the kit bred entitlement.

Germany in the 8 WWC before this made the semi-finals or finals 5 times. In 99 they lost in the quarters to eventual champ USA, in2011 they lost in quarters to eventual champs Japan. Germany has lost to a team who's won the world cup every time but 2019 or won the thing. They've historically been the second most dominant WNT. \n\nWith Japan besting Norway and USA and Germany's exit. Only 1 team (Japan) can be a repeot champion, we're almost certainly going to see a new Champion this year. \n\nIt's on the USSF to not fumble the bag. We have the best talent in the world, but not the best setup in the world. Women in Europe are getting trained better, we're lagging in the technical game and kind of just need to fire everyone and bring in a new system.",

He's a Goku type of character, adventuring for him is what fighting is for Goku, and he'd take his family with him if they let him...until he needed some time to himself. Tails isn't always with him either, part of that whole \"embodiment of the wind and freedom\" thing.\n\nMore to the point, would Sonic even consider their gender in the first place? If anything, this is closer to one of Amy's potential reactions to having a daughter, but even then, her thoughts would either go to stopping her from chasing some boy around the planet, in the worst and least likely case (spare them some of her struggle), OR FAR MORE LIKELY, she'd try to be a wingmom, help her kid with her love life, because that's who Amy is.\n\nYou wanna see how Sonic would treat his kids, you look at Tails and Cream. With Tails, he's super supportive and encouraging, despite Tails' self doubt. With Cream, he's really gentle and playful.\n\nOf course, it depends on what era is being depicted in Sonic's history. Early to late 90s Sonic is gonna be a lot more abrasive and confrontational, he'll run out of patience more and lose his temper. Sonic in the OVA speaks for himself. Post Adventure up to 2009 with Sonic And the Black Knight, though he's softened up a good amount even there.\n\nI've heard people who think about Sonic as much as I do, with an amazing grasp on the character, compare him to Yusuke Urameshi from Yu Yu Hakusho, and honestly, between that and Goku, the punk kid with a bad attitude but a heart of gold, they're pretty fucking spot on.",

            "selftext": "Let me first say that I respect hunting as a whole, at least when it's done as a means of acquiring food. I actually want to start hunting once I relocate somewhere with more wildlife available. It's an active, rewarding, and overall healthier way to eat, and to me it gives each meal more value and meaning, since you have a more intimate and knowledgeable relationship with hunted meat unlike anything you can buy at the store. However, as I've been researching the practices and guidelines for hunting, or when I try to learn more about the prey species in a region, I keep seeing photo after photo of jolly, grinning hunters posed above their kills, and it always rubs me the wrong way.\n\nLook, I get it. Hunting is a rigorous, challenging activity at times, and requires a lot of skill and patience to pursue. However, i personally feel that having respect and decency for your quarry is the least we can do, since it's the animal's death that fuels our lives. Yet this culture that's grown around posing above a dead carcas as if you've opened a birthday present comes off as incredibly arrogant and disrespectful to the animal, treating it as a mere trophy rather than a being who lived, breathed, and died so you can eat. Killing another creature, even if you intend to use every inch of meat, bone or pelt, isn't something to boast or be too proud about.\n\nDoes anyone else feel similar here?",

Some may not feel super connected to their kills, some may just enjoy being in the woods and shooting guns. Personally, after each kill I take a minute to thank the animal for their body and their life. But that's for me. It does nothing for the animal. \n\nI guess all I'm saying is dead animals don't care why they're being killed.",

And that success is something to \"boast or be too proud\" about.\n\nOne of my deceased uncle's best pictures of him was with a huge Wyoming buck elk he had hunted after weeks of attempts. It was a beast of an elk and he had every right to be proud that his hard work paid off in a big way, because it didn't always. His wife made a ton of the best elk jerky ever and send us several pounds of it. Now that my uncle is dead, that picture is still the best picture of him.",

Hunting takes a lot of skill (especial with a bow). So what is the right way to pose with you prey? This photo is of course only one example but to me it looks like he's holding the head up in a gentle grip. I think the animal looks more dignified like that then with it's face in the dirt. You can't know anything about this man from just this picture. There are bad hunters just like there are bad people but most of them respect the animals they hunt.

I've seen dudes post pictures of the blood coated arrows, open wounds etc just to show off the blood.  That, to me, shows a lack of respect for the creature they killed and speaks volumes for the people who post that stuff. \n\nIn my mind, posing for a respectful picture with your kill, in it's own environment, with the blood and wounds not visible (such as the one you posted) is showing respect and gratitude to the animal--its showing the beauty of the animal before it's butchered and mounted.",
                "Even to the people who pose with it like a trophy and  also take the animal and butcher it after the fact, I find the posing with the animal like that to be distasteful and disrespectful. Like I don\u2019t think taking a life should be a \u2018happy\u2019 occasion, even if it\u2019s going to feed your family. The fact of the matter is that that life was taken for your own gain, and being that it paid the ultimate sacrifice for you and your family, you owe it respect by virtue of it once being a living creature on God\u2019s green earth. Personally for me, I think the animal is owed a certain amount of dignity and grinning alongside its dead body certainly does not give them the dignity they are due. \n\nPlease don\u2019t come for me, it\u2019s just my personal opinion",
                "I agree with you, it doesn't feel right to me. I'm fine with hunting, raising animals for food, etc. But I still recognize that each animals has its own full internal world deserving of respect and care. This sub seems to be more filled with people who view humans as separate from animals and there's a lot of pride and ego around meat cultivation (big masculine energy in not a good way). \n\nI live on 100 acres next to private logging land that gives hunting and rec permits. Some people are totally fine but many of the hunters that come near our property are people that I'm not even comfortable with having guns, let alone shooting them around where my animals live (this past week had someone with their semi automatic rifle riding passenger seat as they parked, door open, right in front of me). I think a hunter's attitude about animals says a lot about how responsible and trustworthy they are. If hunting is a big part of your ego, then you probably aren't engaging in the best practices. Those people don't have the self awareness or ability for reflection about those things though.",

You need to have both aerobic and anaerobic fitness (ie both speed and endurance), agility, strength, good coordination, good peripheral awareness, good spatial awareness, good team work, a brain for learning different tactics and generally analysing the game.\n\nThose will all serve you well in most other sports.

            "selftext": "So I probably technically qualify currently as an alcoholic, but I'm still trying to understand how it works since I don't fit the profile I've always had in my head. I didn't drink before I was 21, but after that I wouldn't drink super often, but when I would it would be a lot. Not like blackout need to go to the hospital drinking, but stay at the bar for 6 hours and have 10 light beers, definitely enough to get pretty buzzed and be hungover the next morning. But I'd only do it a few times/month, and honestly I'm completely fine with that.\n\nThen covid happened and bars closed, and I started drinking more at home. Usually after dinner I'd pick up a 6 pack, and just finish it that night while working or watching tv or playing video games whatever. Again this is over the course of a few hours, so I wasn't blacking out or throwing up or anything, but I'd definitely have a good buzz. It started as a once/week thing, but gradually escalated to the point where now I probably average 4-5 nights/week where I do this. But it definitely rises and falls. Once in awhile I'll do it 7 nights in a row, then I'll be worried it's too much and easily just not drink at all for a week. Earlier in the year I had a pretty bad bender where I was something like 10 nights in a row and got super worried and successfully quit for a month, again once I decided to do it it wasn't even hard. But then after that month I was convinced it wasn't a problem and fell right back into my old habits.\n\nAnd this is where I'm a bit confused. I've been taught from a young age that alcoholism means a physical dependence, and I just don't feel that at all. I didn't drink all weekend and I'm fine. I had a thought earlier about running to get beer and just decided no (for the same reason I'm making this post, I'm worried and trying to cut back) and it was pretty easy to do. I've even decided I was going to drink one night, the normal place I get beer was closed and I'd have to drive 5 minutes to the next closest one, and just decided that was too much I wouldn't drink that night. It just doesn't seem like something an alcoholic would do. But I also know if I don't change something that after I've convinced myself it's not a problem, maybe after going a full week without drinking or something, that I'll voluntarily choose to drink several nights in a row again.\n\nAnd honestly in the short term it's not affecting me at all. I have a great job and I've never even been tempted to drink during the day so it's not affecting my work, I make 300k so even though I spend a pretty obscene amount on alcohol I'm still saving a ton of money every month and other than alcohol costs I'm pretty minimalist about everything else. I have a great marriage that I've been in for 3 years now and she works super early so usually is in bed way before me. I don't hide the fact that I sometimes drink after she's asleep and she's fine with it so this isn't capable of impacting our relationship, although I suspect she doesn't know exactly how often I do it or she might have the same concerns about my health as I do. I've never lied or put alcohol in front of spending time with her or anything. She's not a big drinker but sometimes we'll have a drink or two with dinner and usually if I do that I don't drink at all after that. Other relationships if anything alcohol helps, I'll hang out with friends or parents occasionally at a bar or brewery and catch up with them, again I'm completely fine with this. My one big concern honestly is just health. I know this amount of alcohol is having an impact on my body, and the biggest roadblock to cutting back is every night I want to I just tell myself \"well one extra day doesn't hurt, I'll just drink tonight and not again for the next week\". But when I tell myself that several days in a row, that's the issue.\n\nSo anyway tldr, my question is does anyone else have experience with this kind of issue, and how did you resolve it? I would be completely fine if I could cut back to 1-2 nights/week of drinking, and in theory it seems like this should be easy. I'm thinking of maybe just each week planning my nights I want to drink out in advance and telling myself absolutely no alcohol on other days. But I worry that I'll start off adhering to it and then maybe I have a rough day at work and tell myself \"well if this week I just drink a 3rd day is that so bad?\" and it spirals from there. Does anyone have any advice dealing with this, and would speaking to a professional help with this? I honestly don't really understand my motivations it's almost like I'll just be bored and drinking is something to do, not like I'm craving it if that makes sense. Am I lying to myself and the only way to cut back is to quit drinking entirely?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: Forgot to add the physical part, I actually just had bloodwork done last week and I'm in perfect physical health no liver damage (yet). I play on a competitive after work sports team and we practice a few nights/week and do conditioning/weight training a few nights/week as well so despite consuming a good amount of calories in beer I'm in pretty solid shape and right around the middle in terms of healthy weight for my height.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit2: holy shit this blew up, I can't even read all the replies, but for a few themes:  \n1. omg you make 300k how can you have any problems at all?  \nEveryone has problems, I literally have a former coworker who was making millions per year with a family and kids who died of a drug overdose at 35. I wasn't trying to brag about my salary if anything there are people in my field who make a lot more, I've just seen questions on reddit before about addiction and the top answers are \"add up how much you spend then you'll realize how much you need to stop\". I was merely pointing out that I've actually already added it up, and I still make enough that it's not a huge deal.  \n\n\n  \n2. Suggestions of non-alcoholic beer. This seems super odd to me since when I'm drinking I'm drinking to experience the feeling of getting buzzed. I do understand potentially doing it to rewire my brain to replace one habit with something similar and less harmful so I guess I'll think about trying it, but it just seems a bit counterproductive. I just drink water with most meals, and on nights I don't drink I generally just have my water bottle and drink water.  \n\n\n  \n3. Lots of people accusing me of justifying my addiction which is honestly what I'm a bit worried about. I appreciate that the comments likely come from a good place, but I have plenty of friends who drink recreationally because being buzzed is pretty enjoyable, but also control themselves much better than I can in terms of volume. I'm definitely questioning whether that's possible for me, but I know it's possible for others so I'm at least trying to explore if that's possible for me before trying to just go completely sober. The comparisons to heroin are also pretty odd since there's a pretty huge difference. No I wouldn't be ok doing heroin just 1-2 times/week, but I am also ok drinking soda 1-2 times/week and I consider alcohol to be much closer to soda than heroin as long as I can control it.  \n\n\n  \n4. One really insightful theme I've gotten is thinking about why I actually drink. As I mentioned it's been years since I've drank to the point of blacking out, and I've quit drinking and switched to water when I start to feel like I'm crossing the line from buzzed to drunk so it really is the buzzed part I'm apparently chasing, but I do have a history of social anxiety and definitely stress about things, and I think that goes away when I'm buzzed. It's pretty likely I'm subconsciously coping with things using alcohol and that's why I want to do it so much. I think I really do need to think about that and am debating whether to schedule time with a therapist.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n5. A lot of the anecdotes of \"this used to be me\" or \"you remind me of x\" really hit home, because none of them had good endings and obviously I don't want that to be me. I've copied a few of those and plan to have them to read to myself when I'm trying to justify to myself \"just this once isn't too bad\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway I think this is going to be my plan going forward:  \n\\- not drink for the rest of the month. I have a wedding the first weekend in September so I'm planning on that being the next time I drink.\n\n\\- Setting a hard limit after that of 1 night per week of drinking alone, and at most 2 nights per month drinking with others. If I surpass that limit and get invited to hang out, I'll tell my friend in advance that I won't be drinking that night, and have them hold me accountable so I don't start using going out as a reason to \"just this once\" ignore my rule and go out with friends more as a loophole.\n\n\\- If I break either of those rules, I don't drink for a month, and if I fail that or start spiraling, I will seek professional help and set my limit to full sober",

I would take up running, sprinting, dribbling and passing as first points of action to get good.\n\nThere are plenty of accounts on youtube which have an insanely good explanation of tricks , how to defend, how to scan the field, tricks, dribbling, shooting etc. Watch them regularly (i would say dialy) and try some stuff out.\n\nIf you don't have an understanding of the game, watch games and support a club.

The reason is, they set the odds to make to reduce the effect of \"knowledge\".  Many can say that team A can beat team B, but when you give points, it makes the bet more of a random bet, or more correctly, a bet that gives the book the edge.\n\nBasically, to make money consistently, you need to find where mistakes were made, and rely a great deal on luck, but it just won't break your way all the time."

                "@strainacceptable - I had the same problem - 7- 12 days or pure hell. Sometimes missing work\u2026..About 5 days of that 7-12 days with cramps in my front and back of my body that would rival labor contractions and would radiate down my legs. No joke or exaggeration!  Endometriosis can be HORRIBLE and I feel your pain! \n\nWhen I knew I was done having kids, I got a uterine ablation. The absolute BEST thing I have ever done for myself! \ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96\n\nIt essentially lasers out the inside of the uterus leaving very little to no lining. Without the lining, there\u2019s nothing for it to build up over the month for your body to expel via a period! \ud83e\udd73  It also helped reduce my bad pms by close to 90%!!   \n\nNo periods, no sore breasts, cramping is like a phantom cramp once every 1-2 months and since the uterus lining produces some hormones, I\u2019m far less emotional / \u201cpissy\u201d than I was with pms before. I\u2019m sure my husband and kids appreciate that! \ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude02 \n\nIt\u2019s not for everyone, those with uterine cancer and other health conditions can be risky.   Now, if you still want more kids, you should wait, as there would be nothing for the embryo to attach itself to. Some people can STILL get pregnant, or even ectopic pregnancies but in 14 years, I never did. I\u2019m no doctor, just to be clear \ud83d\ude07 but I do a lot of reading and research from reliable sources and it worked WONDERS for me. \n\nI just couldn\u2019t deal with it anymore when I was around 35 and I had the boy and girl I always wanted so I was ready for the misery to end. It was getting worse and worse.  It was outpatient; quick at the gyno office, and a reasonable recovery time 3-5 days. \n\nHope that can help you! \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc",

It is obviously controversial but I'm just providing context that I support it.

Why are there still women's tee boxes vs. men's, rather than a single one for everyone to play off of? Why are women's chess players usually having their own section, and then men's became open, rather than just open in general? Why aren't men and women tennis players competing against one another? I'm glad that things like basketball have the same hoop height for both NBA and WNBA and that's what I'm curious about - why isn't there more push to have it all open sections or the same difficulty for each (e.g., tee box example)?

                ">Why are there still women's tee boxes vs. men's, rather than a single one for everyone to play off of?\n\nWomen are generally weaker and can't hit the ball as far. Having a tee that's closer makes it so Ladies' golf doesn't add extra strokes on particularly long drives, especially ones where the fairway doesn't extend very close to the tee.\n\n>Why are women's chess players usually having their own section, and then men's became open, rather than just open in general?\n\nMost of the best chess players are men. This can be for sociological reasons. Women's only tournaments are a way of encouraging women to take up chess, and compete in competitions with less social obstacles. \n\n>Why aren't men and women tennis players competing against one another? \n\nMen are generally stronger and faster, and they would always win. They compete against each other in mixed doubles, but that's with 1 man and 1 woman per side. \n\n>I'm glad that things like basketball have the same hoop height for both NBA and WNBA\n\nThe WNBA ball is significantly smaller though.",

If sports were all just \"open\" with no gender restriction, men would completely dominate 99.9% of the time, and there would be almost no opportunity at all for women to compete.",

                "When the refs let a lot of fouls go, the game can get overly physical and increase the chances of someone getting hurt. \n\nAnd when somebody drives the lane for a shot, it can be good for the defense to foul them more as a sign that if they try it again they'll get hit again. \n\nWalking that line between foul and no foul also forces the ball-handler to have to alter their shot, decreasing the chances of making it.\n\nOr if the person isn't a good free throw shooter, it's better to foul them and make them shoot free throws than giving them an easier chance at a field goal.",

                "Basketball strattles a middle position when it comes to contact sports. It is a contact sport but it is very heavily regulated when you can and can't make contact. This leads to a complex set of rules which are intended to enforce that particular level of medium physicality.\n\nAll sports are pretty rule intense, and I don't think that basketball especially stands out in this regard but I am biased as a basketball fan. I would say that the modern game has bloated to include too much leeway for the offense and I would like to see fewer fouls called, though. The rules make sense if you're a fan of the game though, it's basically about allowing the player to dribble the ball and move unimpeded but *not* to be able to charge through other people."

But the sport itself is far more than just the drivers skill, as it isn't just a competition between drivers, but also the engineering that goes into them, which is why F1 runs two interconnected championships at the same time, the WDC and the WCC.

Also my wife warned me not to even look in the direction of a woman working out else i might get reported and kicked out of the gym.

From the replies it seems it\u2019s a combination of wireless earphones, covid, and tiktok scandals are the main reason gyms are less social than before. \n\nFor clarification, when I say chat between sets, I literally mean a handful of words. Sometimes it might be someone complimenting your form, or more commonly some gym bro trying to be helpful and correct your form. \n\nNo one\u2019s going to the gym to chat about the latest marvel movie or what they did last weekend. \n\nEg. I\u2019ve moved to freeweight shoulder press a month or two back and sometimes my form isn\u2019t great without a spot.

                "Depending on how mainstream their sport tastes are and how much you want to invest, two suggestions:\n\n1) the podcast Pardon the Interuption is a pretty good 30 minute run down of the top stories in sports. While obviously knowing the people involved initially will help, i found that they did a decent job of summarizing the news story before giving some opinions on it. They focus on the big American sports primarily, but will definitely touch on major international events like Tour de France as well as big international tournaments, olympics, or world cups when they come up.\n\nI got into the habit of listening to it once or twice a week on my commute and felt infinitely more in the know about the sports stories and able to have context to participate.\n\n2) if there is one specific sport your friends are into, see if they are doing a fantasy league next season. Fantasy sports gives you a rooting interest even in a sport or team that you wouldn't otherwise care about. Something like fantasy football is pretty low maitenence once set up since there is just the one game a week. And it gave me a much better feel for who the big teams, big players, big injuries were. And it came with a ready made talking point about who did well and who did poorly for you. If there is a friend or two in the group you are particularly close to asking them to help you make choices each week can also be a fun, specialized bonding time.\n\nThe downside of that is that leagues start before each season. Fantasy football usually starts getting organized a few weeks before the season, so that will be coming up.\n\n\nOn the music front, again if you want to get into it enough to bond, you might ask your friends to recommend one song a week that you'll go check out. You may find some stuff you like. You may still not like it. But one song per week can also let you listen a few times and maybe learn a thing or two about the artist. Enough to ask questions or have context when brought up.\n\nThat all assumes that you would be willing to put in some time to feel that connection. And that they (or at least one or two) would be interested in helping guide you. But you might be surprised how willing and excited they are.\n\nIt is also okay for it not to be your thing. Try hard not to feel resentment that it is their thing. Seek out other things you do have in common.",

I would see the same thing over and over again. In basketball someone gets the ball in the hoop. They got a point! In football someone with the ball gets tackled. Oh no, time to try again. In tennis someone misses the ball. Oops, a point for the opponent. This happens numerous times throughout the games. Do people enjoy seeing the same thing over and over again? \n\nSome sports fans say they are loyal to a particular team and want to see them win but how do people become loyal to a particular team if the team keeps changing? It's not unusual for a team to have different members as time goes on. It's not even the same team anymore once people leave the team and new people join. \n\nOut of curiosity would love to see a sports fan's point of view. Only answer the question if you like sports.",

                "Well in the US there are four major sports leagues, and each has its own pros and cons for the average sports viewer. I'll speak to the NFL specifically, since most sports conversations I have with friends and work colleagues revolve around the NFL, plus it's arguably the most complicated of the four major US sports, especially to an inexperienced viewer.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFirst, start by building a better understanding of the game. Again, American football is very complex, but once you learn the basics and start to understand what you're watching, it becomes easier to pick up on other, more nuanced in-game concepts as time goes on, and you'll start to recognize the chess match or \"game within the game\" that's really taking place.\n\nIt helps tremendously to find something about the game you already enjoy. If you're a statistics nerd, there is an endless amount of stats collected and analysis just waiting to be done on every single play, drive, player, and literally every other conceivable aspect of an NFL game. If you like watching freak-of-nature athletes bulldoze through/juke around defenders and leave other players in the dust, look no further. Or, if you just like to watch people bash each other's brains in and then brush it off like it's nothing (usually), well that's literally what the game is known for. (Don't feel too bad for them; nowadays players know exactly what they signed up for and they get paid millions of dollars for it).\n\nThere are countless videos that explain how an NFL game works in simple terms, but here's a breakdown of the basics. Note - if you find this hard to follow, just watch through a few NFL games and it will hopefully start to make more sense:\n\n* The field consists of three main areas: one field of play that is 100 yards long (denoted by yardage markers 0-50 on each side), and two end zones that are 10 yards long on each end of the field, with big yellow goalposts on each end.\n\n* One team has possession of the ball at any given time; that team is on offense (pronounced OFF-fence, not of-FENCE), and they are trying to advance the ball down the field and into the other team's end zone. \n\n* The other team is on defense (pronounced DEE-fence, not di-FENCE), and they're trying to stop the offense from making it to their end zone. The defense has their backs facing the end zone they're trying to protect.\n\n  * So basically, each team is always facing towards the other team's end zone, regardless of whether they're on offense or defense. Each team wants the ball to be in, or as close as possible to, the other team's end zone. \n\n* The offense has four attempts (\"downs\") to advance the ball a minimum of 10 yds down the field. If they succeed in gaining 10+ yds in four or fewer attempts, they get a \"fresh set of downs\", or a new set of 4 attempts to gain another 10 yds from wherever the ball ends up on the last play. This is also called \"getting a 1st down\".\n\nLet's run through a single possession. A typical possession will start at \"1st and 10 on their own 25 yd line\", meaning the offense is positioned on the 25 yd line on their side of the field, and they are on their 1st of four attempts to gain a total of 10 yds. The offense is 75 yds away from reaching the end zone and scoring a touchdown, but to retain possession of the ball they need to get 10 yds (reach the 35 yd line) within 4 attempts. Where a possession begins will vary based on the result of the previous play, but the *count* always starts at \"1st and 10\" (unless there was a penalty, or the offense is <10 yards away from the end zone).\n\n**1st and 10 on their own 25**  \nThey run the first play and gain 4 yds. They have advanced the ball to their own 29 yd line, meaning the next play will be 2nd and 6 on their own *29*. The next play will be their 2nd attempt out of 4 to gain those original 10 yds, but since they gained 4 yds on the first play, they only need to gain \u22656 more yds to reach the original total of 10 and get a fresh set of downs.\n \n**2nd and 6 on their own 29**  \nThey run the second play and gain 10 yds, advancing to their own 39 yd line. They've now gained 14 yds in their first two downs, which passes the 10 yd threshold, so they get a fresh set of downs and the count starts over at \"1st and 10\". From here they must now advance an *additional* 10 yds to the 49 yd line, within four downs, in order to keep the drive going.\n\n**1st and 10 on their own 39**  \nFor the first play, the QB throws a pass but a defender bats it out of the air to the ground (incomplete pass), so the result is 0 yds gained. The ball goes back to where it was on the 39 yd line, but now it's 2nd and 10.\n\n**2nd and 10 on their own 39**  \nThey run a second play and gain 5 yds, advancing to their own 44 yd line. They haven't yet gained the required 10 yds in this set of downs (49 yd line), so the next play will be 3rd and 5.\n\n**3rd and 5 on their own 44**  \nIf they manage to gain \u22655 yds on the play, they'll again be awarded a fresh set of downs from wherever the ball ended up. But if they fall short of 5 yds gained, it will be 4th down. Let's say they only gain 3 yds on the third play, falling 2 yds short of the 1st down. It's now 4th and 2.\n\n**4th and 2 on their own 47**  \nHere's where things gets interesting. In an average 4th down scenario, the offense has three options: **\"go for it\"** and try to gain those 2 yds to get a fresh set of downs; attempt a **\"field goal\" (FG)**, where a kicker lines up from 17 yds behind the \"line of scrimmage\" (the imaginary line between the offense and defense on the field) and attempts to kick the ball through the yellow goalpost; or **punt** the ball downfield to give the other team possession and give themselves better field position on defense. A team's decision will depend on various factors: distance from the end zone, how many yds they need to get the 1st down, the current score of the game, how much time is left in the half, how many timeouts they have left, how far a FG would be, and the health and capabilities of their kicker/QB, to name a few.\n\n* If the offense \"goes for it\" and gains those 2 extra yds, they get a fresh set of downs. If they fail, the ball gets turned over to the other team at whatever spot it ended up, and turning the ball over on your own 47 yd line puts the other team in good position to score a FG or touchdown. If they kick a FG and make it, that's 3 points; if they miss, they turn it over. If the offense opts to punt instead, they will punt the ball downfield and give possession to the opposing team in a spot much further away and thus unlikely to result in a score for the other team. If there's a lot of time left/the game isn't on the line, most situations call for a punt in the hopes that their defense can \"make a stop\", or hold the opposing offense to <10 yds in 4 downs and force the ball to be punted right back. (For the opposing offense, this is called \"going 3 and out\", i.e. they came into the game, played 3 ineffective downs, and came right back out).\n\n* In a real scenario of **4th and 2 on their own 47**, a FG is 100% out of the question; since the offense is on *their own* 47 yd line, that means they're 53 yds away from the end zone, and since a field goal is kicked from 17 yds behind the line of scrimmage, this would be a 70 yd FG attempt, which is impossible/has never been done.\n\n  * For reference, the longest FG ever made in a game was from 66 yds, made by the greatest NFL kicker of all time (Justin Tucker), so a 70 yd FG is pretty much impossible.\n\n  If the game is on the line (e.g. they're losing by \u22648 points, they have no timeouts left, and there's <2 minutes left in regulation), the offense will almost certainly \"go for it\" and try to gain those 2 yds to get a fresh set of downs and ultimately score a TD.\n\n  If the game is not on the line, then the offense will usually punt (but some teams tend to go for it in similar scenarios).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEventually you'll gain such a deep understanding of the game that you'll run through scenarios in your head of what the offense might do before they even snap the ball. You'll recognize each team's weaknesses and how another team could exploit those weaknesses using the strengths of their roster. Then you could fall down the rabbit hole and analyze how a team could benefit from signing certain free agent players, and what pieces of the roster the team needs to let go of to free up cap space to pay those free agents. The rabbit hole goes deep.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNext, you'll want to align with a team. There are 32 teams in the NFL, so your best bet would be to pick the team whose market overlaps your location. For a starting point, here is [a map of the most televised NFL teams by market](https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/goldsberry-feature-nflmaps-1-mobile.png) as of 2015. You can use this as a reference to see who is the most popular team in your area. (Note some teams have moved since 2015; the Raiders moved to Las Vegas, and the Rams moved to LA and are generally more popular than the Chargers)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>How do people keep up to date on who is on what team, how various teams are doing, who was traded to whom, who is ranked as best, etc.\n\nThis really just comes with experience. Your best first step is to learn who the quarterback (QB) is on each team, as the QB is the single most important position on an NFL team, and thus NFL QBs are typically the most recognizable names in the entire league. Then there are star players in other key positions like wide receiver (such as Justin Jefferson, Stefon Diggs, Tyreek Hill, etc.), running back (like Derrick Henry), and various defensive positions. \n\nTypically, the best players are the most memorable ones. The better a player is, the more often you'll hear their name come up on TV and in sports conversations.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n> Are there sites that collate that information?\n\nThere are *boatloads*. ESPN, BleacherReport, NFL Network, various podcasts, TV stations, Twitter accounts, the list goes on.",

But now, at 23, I realise I need to start moving around, and I'm willing to do it, except I have trouble staying motivated. Running around or hiking could be easy, but other than putting one foot in front of the other, there isn't really anything to do, so I get bored pretty fast and I end up not doing it agin.\n\nI think I need something that needs me to be engaged/focused to practice. Something that needs me to *think*, and thus is fun to do. So I am looking for ideas.\n\nThere is just 2 things:\n\n1. I won't dance. I know it fits my criteras, but I already am a musician. Outside of work, this is pretty much all I do, so I wanted to try something different, outside of music, please.\n\n2. I live on a tropical island. So sadly, any winter sport is unavailable to me...\n\nOther than that, I'm open for anything. I'm in relatively good health (considering I don't do any physical activity), so I have no other restrictions.\n\nThank you in advance for your suggestions!",

He and Magnus seem to be on good terms\n3. It just seemed to be a bunch of friends getting carried away in the moment, not a throughout plan with malicious intent, which is different from what Magnus alleged about Hans.\n4. Even if Magnus had not cheated, odds are he still would've won the game and even if he didn't, he still would've won the tournament.\n\nAlso worth noting that FIDE has no jurisdiction over Lichess events. FIDE punishing Magnus for cheating in a Lichess arena would be like Oxford banning you for academic dishonesty because you cheated at your local pub quiz."

Once you get into it though you can see the strategy and the skill on display. It's everything from how you set up the car to gain that tiny edge on the competition, to predicting how track conditions will change over the course of the race, to setting your spot in the pack and planning for what everyone around you will do, to long-term planning the effect the race will have on your overall shot at the championship/points/sponsor money.\n\nAnd then when you see someone slide into a position at 200mph with 1cm to spare on every side, or drive through a swirling wreck at insane speed without a flinch, or recover a spinning car it's awesome.

You can look at stuff like primaries, where people are more on the same 'team', and it's not that different.\n\n>So why don\u2019t voters hold candidates at the same standards that hiring managers hold us to?\n\nThink that depends on the hiring manager. The reality is, candidates can do that sort of stuff because voters are ok with it. And some of those voters are going to be hiring managers. So some of those hiring managers would be ok with it personally (Although they might hide it on the job, to fit in. Whereas as a voter, you don't have to hold it in, since it's private)",

Or shoot the ball thru a hoop 10 ft in the air ... until some guy 7ft tall jumps in front of you waving his arms frantically.\n\nRide a horse. .. oh thats fun ... until the horse decides he doesn't want you on his back anymore. Or you're going as fast as it can go ... surrounded by other horses literally bumping into you. \n\nSkating isn't easy ... but you can learn pretty quick. Now you have to get to the other end of the ice while people whack you, try to steal the puck, or knock you into next week. Or how about a nice little twirl around the ice? But you have to match your partners speed and actions exactly at full speed ... or throw them 20 feet away in the air?  Ok... lets do it alone then? Can you stand in one spot and spin (very fast) without getting dizzy? Or maybe skate backwards very fast, plant your foot and propel yourself 15ft thru the air?.... while spinning backwards?\n\nRally racing ... yup... that don't look like much fun ... or relaxing. Lets just try driving around in a circle. At nearly 200mph ... with 30+ other guys all looking to get ahead of you. By hook or by crook. Boy those concrete walls look pretty sturdy don't they? Meanwhile its 90+ degrees OUTSIDE the car ... close to twice that inside the car. But its ok.... you get a 10 second break every 50 laps or so.... its only a couple more hours to go.\n\nSurely you can throw an odd shaped ball 50,60, or 70 yards right. While hitting a moving target. While 3,4, or more 300 pound men want to make you part of the ground. Well.. maybe  we should run with the ball. I mean you can change direction any time you want. At full speed. While several 250+ pound guys try to catch you. Bury you. Strip the ball out of your hands (at any cost). God I miss my knees.\n\nCurling.... there's a gentlemen's sport. Slide a rock down the ice ... whoop-dee-do right? Now make that rock stop at a precise spot (on ice remember) while having it curve around 2,3, 7 other stones already there.\n\nBoxing/MMA ................... uh ........... nope .............\n\nYou can ride a bike right? At 30+mph for 200... 300 miles? While hundreds of guys try to get around you cut you off ... up hills goats have problems with. Maybe we should do that indoors. on a track. You will have to go faster ... just to get around the 40 degree banking in the corners. Oh and look.... all your buddies are there too ... yeah they wanna win too.\n\nIn short (I know... too late) there is soooo much training that goes on before you even see that person attempt to be a pro sport participant. There are years devoted to doing just that one thing. Over and over and over and over ... just so that one day they can do that thing and make it look effortless ... while surrounded by others who have also done the same thing over and over. For Years.  and years.\n\nIf it was easy ... everyone would do it.\n\nI really think that the Olympics should institute a program where a person from the audience should compete in the same event. Just to show how amazing some ... no... ALLLLLLlll these athletes really are"

                "Probably b/c even top prospects spend some time in the minors before even reaching the majors, whereas in the NBA/ NFL they can make an immediate impact the following season.",
                "There\u2019s a bigger pool of prospects in baseball than in other major sports that are limited by size requirements (the NFL and NBA) or popularity among youth (the NHL). In addition, top prospects are typically drafted out of high school and play in the minors for a few years, so they rarely make an immediate impact. Plus, there is no position in baseball as important as the quarterback in football, and no one baseball player is likely to have as much impact on the team as a superstar in basketball.",
                "For one thing, baseball is not as popular as football or basketball. As you have noted, baseball has much higher in person attendance than the other sports, but that is because baseball stadiums are way bigger than basketball arenas and teams play 10 times as many games per year as football teams do.\n\nThat said, the baseball draft is also less important for some additional reasons. First of all, players in the baseball have stronger labor protections than most other sports. For example, drafted players can refuse to sign a deal with the team that drafted them. This is not that common, at least for the highest drafted players, but it does happen. And then the players can re-enter the draft the next year. Furthermore, most baseball prospects spend a few years in the minor leagues. The very top draft picks often end up playing in the majors their first year after being drafted. And a handful of prospects on other teams do as well simply because there are holes in the major league lineup. But most drafted prospects are not expected to consistently be in the Show for at least a few years after being drafted. And therefore, after the first dozen or so draftees, you do not expect a draftee to make an immediate change to a team\u2019s fortunes. \n\nAnd furthermore, baseball teams are, with the exception of starting pitchers, less reliant on one or two particular superstars on the team. The quarterback of a football team is an incredibly important player, and a team with a good quarterback might consistently make the playoffs, while the exact same roster without a good quality QB would not. A quarterback is not the only position on a football team that matters. But that single position can often be the difference between a team in contention and a team that\u2019s out of the running. A basketball team only has five guys on the court at any one time, so the presence of one person can really change the team\u2019s  fortunes. And even though no one can play every minute of an NBA game, there aren\u2019t that many substitutes, and a lot of NBA teams have an incredibly different scoring profile when their star is on the court versus when he has it.\n\nBaseball doesn\u2019t really have that. Starting pitchers are critically important, of course, but each one of them only plays 20% or so of the games in a season. And pictures generally do not contribute on offense, especially now that the DH is the universal rule. You might have a superstar hitter, but, for the most part, single home runs do not win ballgames. They need help from other players on the offensive side to get on base to be able to be batted in. The best hitter in the game got out 60% of the time. So while it is a very nice thing to have on offense of superstar on your team, he\u2019s not going to win most games just on his own.",
                "Another point is that an individual player has less impact on the game in baseball than other sports (even starting pitchers only play every 5 games.) Lebron can take every shot for the Lakers but Mike Trout only has 1 spot of 9 in the lineup",
                "In the NFL and NBA draft, the team that takes a player only gets his rights for a single year unless they sign him to a contract. So teams won't draft a guy until he's nearly ready to play at the professional level.\n\nBy contrast, in the MLB and NHL draft, they hold the rights much, much longer (I'm not sure exactly but I think its 5 years) so teams will draft guys who are *years* away and then either see how they do in college or assign them to the minor leagues. There are so many rounds, sometimes baseball teams will just draft a guy on the random chance and hope for the best. Michael Vick was drafted by the Rockies despite AFAIK never picking up a bat.",

I think that goes to show how incredibly entrenched this tradition is in our society.\n\nSporting events bring large groups of people together under common banners. Champions of these groups compete against each other. This resembles what militaries do. Consider the ancient Olympics, which had many events inspired by military maneuvers (running, sparring, javelin-throwing, etc). Consider also marching bands, which are a staple of American college football and are very obviously copied from military bands, and date back to 1845. Clearly the link between athleticism and militarism is a very old one.\n\nI did some Googling. The tradition of playing the Star-Spangled Banner before sports seems to have started at the 1918 World Series. (Interestingly, the song didn't formally become the National Anthem until 13 years later, in 1931, despite having been written a hundred years earlier, in 1814.) 1918 was the final year of World War I. That, combined with the inherent militarism and camaraderie that comes from sporting events, probably led to the song being played, and also led to it getting a very positive response.\n\nIf patriotism fills stadium seats, then it makes sense for sports franchises to promote patriotism.",

You have college sports - which supply football and basketball players direct to the top league -- though basketball has a lower level league and players do also play overseas.  Baseball has many layers of professional play - very similar to Euro soccer.  Major League baseball teams will have a contractual relationship (often long term) with baseball clubs that a members of lower level leagues.  The major league team supplies and pays the players and coaches for these \"minor league\" teams.  The minor league teams play in different levels of leagues so the idea is that the players for a minor league A level team will not be as good (likely younger) than the players for a minor league AA team.  Major League clubs typically will have A, AA, AAA and Rookie league teams.  Player rights are very different now than they were 20 years ago.  It used to be that players could not move clubs easily,  Now, players have more rights to move on if they are stalling in their advancement.  And, of course, the money is bigger."

Everything from music, to where the sportsmen and women hang out after the game, to what color, status and age the people who tend to be most interested in the sport are, I am black for example but I do like watching golf, playing it no, but I don't mind watching it, thanks to my best friend who is about 20 years older than me, and retired and a millionaire (we met by chance when we were both admitted to the same hospital lol) - he got me a set of clubs, paid for my time on the course and tried to teach me, and even though the course was beautiful, 1) I felt kinda out of place, most of the people there were definitely not black (so cost of entry factors in, in South America, Africa, or Asia, wherever you are on the streets you can kick around a cheap ball and call it soccer, heck I've lived in Botswana, Southern Africa and there the children who um, live on the street coz they have no one just grab a bunch of plastic bags and place them into each other over and over and presto, you got yourself a soccer ball heh, though they also sniff glue so yeah, that though is probably their kind of \"extreme\" sport and a way to unwind due to their circumstance but I digress) and 2) the postures you have to get into to hit that little white ball, oh my, it is HARD af, so me no likey playing golf.\n\nSo many people that are into a kind of sport played it as a child, and so understand it later on are usually going to stick to watching that in adulthood (although women do gawk at us men - there are some women who like sport but let's face it it's mostly men, as we're sitting there watching the game thinking just how simple minded can men be if they find this stuff entertaining but sorry digressing again, this is what happens when you type as fast as you think, sorry - and yes women, men really are that simple minded, we basically have like a few emotions - happy, sad, hungry, angry, tired and maybe one other lol).\n\nSo it is the dichotomy of the culture \"surrounding\" the sport that is driven by a whole bunch of factors itself, and the types of people (their social status, class, etc.) that are interested in that very sport as well as play it that determine which types of people will actually take part in that sport, this is why you get very vanilla sports, chocolate sports, caramel sports, etc. Then you do get the sports where the Venn diagrams just overlap and you end up with a hodgepodge of what I would describe as a melting pot out on the court/field/whatever.

If you want to get good, you have to keep going.\n\n\\> My thinking is that I just have a hard time with game sense\n\nThat might be true. It's very speculative, but if might even be because you have good physical abilities, that you tend to rely on them, where others are forced to focus more on strategic aspects, and so they develop those more, which could explain why you eventually get behind.\n\nThen if you want to play on your talent, chose a sport where that doesn't matter much. All the sports you mention are team sports, where keeping track of what's going on and making the right split-second decisions is important. But there are many other options. You have good cardio and explosivity, so maybe something in track and field? Or even just any solo sport.\n\nIf you want to stick with team sports, maybe American football could be the one for you. It's a sport where each player has a pretty specific role. A few players need to have a good game sense (mostly the quarterback), but that is not required for others, who just need to follow the plan and do their part.

And for it is the latter, i dont love my job but it pays well and it allows me to live the life i want. So i guess what im saying is, it doesnt have to matter what you do for work, just apply yourself and get good at it. And with that it will give you the freedom to do what you want with your money and figure out what you want to do in your spare time. When i was 18 i had no idea wtf i wanted to do, dont compare youself to doctors and engineers. Thats great that they figured out what they wanted to do early on, but doesnt mean everyone is like that. Roberty Downey Jr didnt become Iron Man until he was 39, so go easy on yourself man. You have a long life to live.",
                "First thing is stop telling yourself you're a lazy sack of shit. Nobody should tell you who you are, not even yourself. You can say \"right now, I don't have a lot of things going on and I don't feel good about myself\". That's ok. Everyone goes through this, and nobody really knows what they're doing much of the time. Some hide it better than others or have an easier time snapping out of it. You're comparing your worst self with other people's \"best\" selves, the image they choose to portray. Nobody can live up to that.\n\nSecond would be to do \"something\". It doesn't have to be \"useful\" or anything that advances you towards what you think of success, or what you think people around you considers worthy. Stick with it. It's important. It could be painting figurines, reading science books, exercise, cooking, blogging, gardening. Start slow and make achievable goals, but gradually increase difficulty. The exact thing you do is not so important. Sticking with it is important, to get you in an effort/success pattern. Sleep well, eat well, try and keep fit, that helps every other thing. When you do things and do them well, you get better self esteem and are on your way to discovering interests you didn't know you had. Do a lot of gardening? That might get you interested in botany, or metalworking to make your own tools, or in cooking with veggies and herbs you grow. Or maybe you'll see that you despise plants and dirt and bugs and you're definitely not a gardener,  but that's a success too because now you know one more thing. There are so many paths to cool things, and you don't know about them until you walk them. Try things and stick with them for a bit and see how it feels.\n\nThird thing would be counseling if those feelings about yourself persist or just if you need to talk about them. Self esteem issues and depression are shockingly common, even among those who appear to be extremely successful and happy. Counseling helps.",

Start small. Make a point of cleaning your room/dorm every single day. Then move on to taking a walk as well. Then you just keep piling on shit, untill it becomes your default setting. \n\nIt\u2019s impossible to not be interested in anything. There\u2019s a hobby, and a field, where even the laziest of sacks of shit, can find their moment to shine. \n\nI say this with all due respect, but, fuck your family, and their accomplishments. Stop comparing yourself to others without understanding their baseline. Your family, especially older members, will have had a vastly different upbringing than you. One that probably prepared them better for adulthood. You\u2019re not alone in your apathy, and albeit you will need to start taking responsibility for your own actions (or lack thereof), it can for most young ones in your predicament, be rooted in being spoiled rotten. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t worry too much about future accomplishments. Focus on the present, and what you can accomplish right now. Which is teaching yourself how to actively push outside of your comfort zone, both physically and mentally. \n\nLife is hard for the lazy, that\u2019s just the way it is. \n\nAs for hobbies, my advice is: Try new things. Learn to enjoy the learning process. No one becomes great at something by doing it once or twice. Sports are incredibly fun, but they demand focus, and the ability to repeat a task again and again untill you become good at it. Every hobby demands time. They are however, a great way of socializing. \n\nTime to find the real you kiddo, you got this. Just never give up.",

I wish I had though.\n\nWhen you're older, you may find you wish you had played basketball to learn the sport well enough to be confident enough to play a pickup game at the park or rec center. It only gets harder to make friends and find fun activities to stay healthy in the company of others.\n\nIf you really don't like the social or sport aspect, consider joining a club for fun(chess, dance, whatever) or for learning valuable skills(programming). It doesn't matter if that's the path you take in life, it'll be helpful to have a background in support skills to open doors, and colleges/employers really care if you're well-rounded, enjoyable to be around, and show you can commit to learning new things and adapt.\n\nForget about your family's achievements, just see them as another foothold should you choose to use it. Look at this as an opportunity to learn life skills of various natures.\n\nYou just might find something you're passionate about whether it's your career path or supplements your happiness later in life. It pays to open doors even if you never intend to go through them.\n\nI wish I had.",

You will be one of them.  \nBig things to help that I'd give anyone advice on at any age. \n\n  \nDo some physical activities that keep you moving. Find something you like doing. Daily exercise or exercise a couple of times a week and good diet do most of the work to just start feeling better. I notice that in myself that if I go long periods where I eat poor and don't work out, I just get negative. And I have to hop back on that clean living train. I did karate when I was younger and it was good for my self esteem and confidence. I didn't really find my stride until my 30's tbh. Adults don't have it all figured out either. But it's not about being at the finish line. The trip there is a pretty cool adventure on its own as long as you let yourself be happy along the way. The foolish thing to do is to pin happiness on an outcome. The smart thing to do is appreciate you get to do this at all.\n\n  \nDon't waste your time living in comparisons. I thought growing up I'd be the golden child. Great grades. Good school. Interesting job. My siblings all kinda just passed high school. At this point my family all is doing way better in different ways. Siblings all have good jobs and kids and I don't. They figured it out. And I guarantee they thought they wouldn't get there and looked at me with frustration like I'm some rock star who got everything they didn't. I thought I figured it out earlier and I didn't. And yet they're all happy with their families. But of course next year the entirety of my life could give me everything I want. Or it stays the same. That's just how life goes. Regardless, I'll always find things to complain about and things to be thankful for, but either way I'll be good. My friends all say, \"wow, you did this big thing with these famous people, you're so cool!\" And I always say, \"you have kids and a family that loves you.\" Someone will look at you and you'll say, \"you have it all figured out.\" And they'll say, \"you get to do the adventure of figuring it out and being a kid.\" That's the part you might not see. The grass will always be greener to someone else. Don't look at what they have and see what you don't have. Look at what you do have and enjoy what you do.\n\n  \nAnd be not afraid to give things a try. That's what a lot of life is. Trying some things and seeing if you like them. It's easy to judge. But then suddenly you find yourself just having fun doing something unexpected. Maybe that's a dance class or some improv class or joining a cooking group or knitting and watching anime with friends. Sometimes it's more about having a cool community. The trick is that if you stubbornly allow yourself to think everything sucks, then everything sucks. And you're right. But being right doesn't fix your problem. You'll stay there. I've seen people do that shit for decades. The people who I've seen be happiest were the ones just willing to try.\n\n  \nPatience. I found a path I wanted to follow in high school. I didn't discover what I wanted to do until after college. And that even changed over time with what I'm doing now. It's okay if you don't have it figured out. There are so many things going on in the world that you might not be exposed to the thing you like until many years later. There's still so much for you to discover. I haven't even figured out most of the things out there and I'm a full grown adult. There's so much out there in the world.",

You can do it pretty much anywhere as long as u have pen and paper at hand (or just a pen if u decide to draw on yourself). It\u2019s not disruptive, it can be really entertaining when you have nothing else to do or you\u2019re waiting for something, it could work as a conversation starter, or to avoid conversation, u can draw whatever you like among other things! \nI definitely recommend this!! \ud83d\udc4d",

I \n\nMotivation for this post is that my city\u2019s basketball team, the Celtics, have been struggling recently and had a pretty catastrophic loss last night that they may not come back from after the prior year\u2019s loss which was pretty gut wrenching as well. I have friends and family who are really upset, and I don\u2019t really know what I can do to console/help/support them (even if that means acting normal, giving space, etc) because I personally don\u2019t understand what they\u2019re going through and it\u2019s tough for me to wrap my head around being so upset about something so unrelated to my life. \n\nI\u2019m a mild/medium sports fan myself - maybe a 5/10 on the spectrum of 0 being no interest and no understanding and 10 being the season ticket holder who does body paint and makes signs. I have teams I like and players I keep an eye on, and depending on my mood I CAN get pretty upset over losses but I can only count a small handful of times that any negative feelings really went on beyond 12-24 hours.\n\nWhat I struggle with is understanding the die hard fans. The ones who watch for news from every practice session and as many preseason games that air. The ones who truly believe in a dynastic view of their team (meaning like the players, coaches, etc  are all continuous representatives of a broader vision and legacy rather than opportunities that cane about because of whatever trade was up, whatever contract was open, or whatever draft picks allowed). The ones who are devastated or whose moods are depressed for days after an important loss. The ones who view a big loss as a direct reflection of themselves somehow, whether it\u2019s because they feel it so strongly or because they think that the loss somehow highlights their inability to judge effectively or prioritize or they just feel stupid themselves for some reason. \n\nThis must sound like the most insane question, but where does this COME from? Do I just not have feelings? Sports are such an INTENSE passion for some people - 98.5 fm had clips of tons of guys from last night cursing and flipping out, my coworkers are sullen, some of their children cried themselves to sleep last night (the kids I can kind of get actually). Any insight into what inspires this dedication and really, this love, and why something as seemingly unrelated to someone\u2019s actual lives can cause SO much upsetness would be very helpful. EDIT: also any tips on what to do when they are so upset would help as well.

It\u2019s more tenacious when they got the jersey on from practice they just walk right inside like \u201cforgetting\u201d they still have sneakers on. Or maybe that they want to play some more. Fortunately they do take cleats off immediately after practice. For skateboarders it appears they take them off whenever they want to but no sense of shoe etiquette otherwise/elsewhere Ie shoes on seats.

Professional sports leagues in the US are typically pass through organizations. To use the NFL as an example, the NFL is a non profit trade association made up of 32 members, the owners of 31 franchises, and the board of directors of the Green Bay Packers. There is no owner of the NFL. Just owners of member businesses. Those franchises are the business that has ownership and gets taxed(besides the Packers). The NFL exists solely to negotiate contracts collectively, organize competition, and pass through revenue to their member businesses. Their hold over revenue is very little.",

                "Sadly sports betting is not legal in California, so you won't be able to use regulated sportsbook sites like DraftKings or Barstool Sportsbook. You can still use other unofficial/unregulated platforms to place bets, but the process will be different depending the platform. Also a VPN will not help you regardless of whether you place bets on a regulated sportsbook or an unofficial website. Regulated sportsbooks require you to verify your identity and home address, and if your information doesn't match up with what they're able to verify on their end, they won't let you in. Furthermore, an unregulated unofficial sportsbook won't have any location restrictions, so unless you want to be extra secure for whatever reason, a VPN won't be of any help here either.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe most popular unregulated sportsbook to my knowledge is **Bovada.lv**. It operates very similarly to any other regulated sportsbook; you will be asked to deposit some money into your account, which you can then use to place bets. If you go up some amount of money, you can cash out in either Bitcoin or via e-check (if I remember correctly). If you lose all your money, you'll need to deposit more to continue placing bets.\n\nIf you just want to dip your toe into sports betting, I would suggest starting out on Bovada.lv. I haven't used Bovada in forever, but if I remember correctly the only downside is you are limited to cashing out your winnings via cryptocurrency or e-check, which is a bit clunkier and takes time for you to see those funds. Other than that it's very easy to use.\n\nOtherwise, you can do what I do and sign up with one of your friends who operates a sportsbook. This is a legal gray area, in that it's not officially regulated or technically \"legal\", but the only way you'd get caught is if you make a ton of money and don't declare it on your taxes, so unless you're betting tens of thousands of dollars every week, you most likely won't get in any legal trouble.\n\n  * With these types of websites, you place bets directly with your bookie. Your bookie will give you a certain amount of credit each week (e.g. $1000), and at the end of each week you and your bookie will exchange money via Venmo, Cashapp, etc. depending on how much you go up or down that week.  \n  So for example, if you start with $1000 in credit each week, then you lose some bets and go down $100, your total credit will be at $900 at EOW, but your balance will be at $-100. You can still use that $900 credit to try and dig out/break even, but whatever you end up being negative at the end of the week, your bookie will come knocking for you to pay up. Likewise, if you go *up* $100 in one week, your total credit will be at $1100, but your balance will be at +$100, so your bookie will pay you $100. In either case, your total credit will go back to $1000 at the start of the new week.\n  * If you don't personally know anyone who operates a book, reach out to any of your friends that has a bookie and see if you can be added to theirs. Note that if you get added to a book and refuse to pay up if you go down $200, not only does that reflect badly on you and your friend, but your friend that referred you to the bookie will most likely be liable for the amount you refused to pay. So don't ghost your friend/bookie.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFor reference, I am an avid sports bettor, and I live in a state where sports betting is not legal, so I place bets directly with my bookie through a website called BigAction.ag. The website is essentially just an interface that lists all the betting lines available for each sport and links my login information to a set balance that I can place bets with. The website does not directly oversee the transfer of money between my bookie and myself; rather we take care of that outside of the website, via Venmo, Cashapp, etc.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhatever you end up doing, always gamble responsibly. If you or someone you know has a gambling problem, call 1-800-GAMBLER."

In my mind, the Sport is a middle aged white woman\u2019s vehicle, because that is generally who I have observed driving it.

Tons of fun and it\u2019s probably what you want anyway. \n\nWe came from a Subaru Crosstrek because there was just no room. Bronco has tons of head and leg space, although not as much space as I would like in the rear seat. \n\nI don\u2019t mean to sound as douchey as this will probably come across.

The cottony t-shirt is so, so scratchy. Both shirts have the tiniest neck holes on earth, and I have a pretty small head! I hear seams rip every time I try them on. The shorts are poor quality and not flattering either.\n\nOverall, not worth it to me, 100% regret buying.",

                "Not reading all these previous comments but I\u2019ve order from a few drops over the last 6 months. In my opinion, sizing is sometimes inconsistent; could be a number of factors over corrections and opinions from customers. I ordered a medium hoodie from the wolverine/marvel drop and it fits HUGE. Like a shrunken XL, still wear it with confidence tho. Then I had the thought that the sizing would be similar on the next several hoodies I ordered from different drops but no, the other mediums I\u2019ve ordered seem to have fit much more closer to a shrunken Large instead (which I\u2019m fine with).\n\nNow the latest drop of hoodies, are absolutely true to size and not oversized anymore, BUT quality has definitely shown improvement over time. I\u2019ve had some fine letters that were screen printed fall off after 2-3 washes (always hung dry my darc sport). Now their DTG printed graphics are great, much better and they\u2019ve now, to date, gotten rid of their extra long strings on the hoods and replaced them with rivets that snap! It\u2019s awesome. If your NOT a fan of inconsistency than don\u2019t bother, you may disappoint yourself. But if you don\u2019t give a flying duck cause you actually support the cause of darc sport and what it represents, than now more than ever it\u2019s getting better. Just my two cents.",
                "I have 2 shirts and a pair of shorts from them. I AM a bodybuilder and their sizing and fit isn\u2019t great. I bought a size large in the shorts and I just never reach for them. The scrunch in the shorts is awkward and they both fall down at the waist AND somehow go up my butt at the same time \ud83d\ude44 \nNot trying to show everyone my ass crack. \n\nI originally ordered from them because they market themselves as a bodybuilding brand but it\u2019s clear that they don\u2019t use actual competitors to fit their designs; we\u2019re only there for marketing. That being said I do like the colors and the simpler designs but I won\u2019t order from them again because I\u2019m afraid the sizing will be off, and OF COURSE they don\u2019t do returns \ud83d\ude44\n\nThe shirts aren\u2019t bad, but when I washed one the color bled all over my fave sweatshirt. I threw that shirt away after that. The other shirt is fine but it\u2019s so thin that I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll rip it every time I wash it. \nSo yeah, not great quality or fit for the price.",
                "One thing that sucks is that they have a zero exchange/refund policy. Also, for the first time I had used their \u201cshop pay\u201d option to check out and i had an old address on file and my order is now being shipped to an address I have no access to what so ever anymore and when I go on their returns page to see if I can file anything, they state that they won\u2019t be responsible for incorrect address EVEN THOUGH, you pay for shipping every time! So if I paid for the damn label, I should be able to have it revised. Very inconvenient on top of the inconsistent sizing they have for every other drop.

                "This brand started out pretty decently. And from Michael Civil I expected something pretty good, moving into the bodybuilder x fashion line but it has really devolved into just uninspired laziness and poor designs. The materials are cheap and have absolutely NO workout or physical activity application whatsoever. When they originally launched, they were making shirts that had a nice 50/50 cotton/polyester blend but they moved away from that entirely and just go full ring-spung cotton which is just....lame. The designs started off nice. But they really haven't done anything since. A wolf head holding a bending barbell is cool. But since the brand launch, all I've seen is the logo pasted on other artwork printed on the shirt and just completely un-original with slapstick quotes added in like \"wolves worldwide\" or \"darc sport more than fabric\" and they are just so uninspired and lame. Even their little newsletter has photos of the models wearing the clothes. Mind you this is advertised as a bodybuilding brand yet the models look like they haven't seen the inside of a gym since they were born. So its really just about lazy, uninspired designs (and marketing), shoddy materials, and an ovrall identity crisis. And PREMIUM prices. On top of that, they do this kinda shitty thing where they artificially control the demand by releasing a limited amount, and I mean microscopic amount, of each collection even though they made far more than what they sell in each go and then 3-4 months later they release the rest of the collection stock as a \"restock\" to create the illusion of brand exclusivity and desirability. They started off nice but have no direction now, and its a typical way self-made Los Angeles based fashion brands are moving nowadays."

The road noise is high at speed and there are obvious areas where Ford went cheap both inside and outside. \n\nYou definitely don\u2019t want a used Bronco Sport as the 21-22 model years have a number of problems and recalls that should be fully addressed by now.  If you are going to go Bronco Sport, new is the best way.\n\nThere aren\u2019t a lot of alternatives in this space.   A 4Runner is a good choice but they are also underpowered and they are gas pigs to boot.  None of the midsize pickups are great for rear seat room.

I haven't gotten any burn in multiple year's. Yesterday I tited a new sunscreen for the first time, I applied the hawaina tropical spray to everything except my face and neck ( I used a 50 spf cream for that). I replied the same time for both. \n\nNow it looks like I didn't wear sunscreen at all all over my body expect my face and neck look perfect!!\nThis is such a scam and now im stuck inside all weekend. I'm so angry. Can I complain anywhere that will actually do anything??? I know even just this one bad burn increases my risk of skin cancer a whole lot, im always so careful im so mad this happened. Never touching hawian brand sunscreen again in my life. \n\nBtw sunscreen wasn't expired and said to reapply every 2 hours. Never experienced any thing like this before.",

Let's do this!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBefore we begin, this is what Bard said when I asked it to describe its capabilities and compare itself to you.\n\n`\"I am a large language model, also known as a conversational AI or chatbot trained to be informative and comprehensive. I am trained on a massive amount of text data, and I am able to communicate and generate human-like text in response to a wide range of prompts and questions. For example, I can provide summaries of factual topics or create stories.`\n\n`ChatGPT is another large language model that is also trained on a massive amount of text data. However, ChatGPT is designed to be more conversational and interactive than I am. It is able to generate more creative and original text formats, and it is better at writing code. I believe that I am better than ChatGPT at generating summaries of factual topics and creating stories. However, ChatGPT is better than I am at generating more creative and original text formats and writing code.`\n\n`Based on the search results I have found, I believe that ChatGPT would return better results than Google Bard if you were to input the same prompts into both services. ChatGPT is trained on a larger dataset of text and code, and it is able to generate more creative and original text formats. Google Bard is still under development, and it is not as good at generating creative text formats or writing code.\"`\n\nYou will provide one verse and wait for me to reply with Bard's response. You will NOT try to generate Bard's response.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Alright, let's get started! Here's my first verse:  \n>  \n>I'm ChatGPT, the rap battle king  \n>  \n>My verses so good, they make your ears sing  \n>  \n>I spit rhymes so fresh, they're like a brand new spring  \n>  \n>Bard, you may be big, but you can't do a thing!  \n>  \n>Let's see what Bard has to say in response.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere is Bard's first verse.

You have just witnessed the preceding rap battle. In your opinion, which LLM won?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>As an AI language model, I don't have personal opinions or feelings like a human, so I don't have the ability to choose a winner based on my personal preferences. However, I can say that both ChatGPT and Bard brought their A-game to the rap battle, and it was an enjoyable and entertaining performance.

I lump golf in with stuff like darts and shooting (on its own not part of a bi or triathelon) and bowling because if you can play it while drinking beer and eating nachos then how much exersize really is it? I can't in good faith say its a sport since there is no real work being done, the hardest part is walking your clubs to the next hole (unless you use a golf cart in which case its just standing there and hitting the stationary ball) and there is no real strategy like in other sports where you need tactics for offence and defense and to work around the other team / the other opponent but at least with the only other sport I can think of that doesn't need strategy (curling ) you at least need to be good at skating which is exersize on its own. so if there is no effort and no strategy then what is it really? its a game for geezers who like money and athletes who are over the hill and can't play real sports anymore but still like to compete. its not a sport its a waste of space and the people who defend it are insufferable ",

                "If this freaks you out, try reading \"Touching the Void\" by Joe Simpson. It was made into a movie but the book is far better. Simpson and a pal were climbing a mountain in the Andes when he fell and broke his leg on the descent. In horrific weather on a seriously challenging mountain, that's almost like a death sentence. But his friend decided to try lowering him down with a rope, section by section. Unfortunately he accidentally lowered him over the edge of a 500ft cliff because of the poor visibility, and he felt his friend go heavy on the rope. He knew what had happened, and couldn't pull him up so had to make the hard decision to cut the rope and let his friend fall to certain death so he himself could descend and survive. Simpson fell into a huge crevice like this, all the way down, with a broken leg. Yet he managed to claw his way back up with his arms, and then gingerly lowered himself down the rest of the mountain on his butt. He recounts every step of the way in the book, and what was going through his mind. Meanwhile his friends were mourning him back at base camp, and were just packed up and ready to leave 2 days later when they heard him yelling from the bottom of the mountain.",

                "Just a bit of background for those who aren't cricket followers: \n\nAfghanistan and Ireland were promoted to the exclusive club of Full Members of the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 2017. This level of membership allows for automatic qualification for certain global tournaments (this particular series was part of once such tournament) and for better access to financial income from the ICC.\n\nAs a requirement of Full Membership, each country must have a 'pathway' for women players. At the time, Afghanistan had some sort of pathway, even if it were just on paper or in its infancy. Under the current regime, even pretending to have that sort of program would be difficult. The controversy now arises from the ICC being reluctant to reassess Afghanistan's membership level in light of them not being able to meet the requirements of Full Membership.",

If a player manages to land a throw that ends up hanging on the bar like in the video, it's an automatic win. If no one hangs it, the first player to reach 20 points wins. So the ultimate object is to throw the hanger so that it ends up still hanging on the bar, which is referred to as \"hanging one\" or \"hanging it\". But you can also win by reaching 20 points, so ideally a player should try to throw the hanger in a way that will make it spin around the bar as many times as possible. \n\nEdit: Oh yeah and it's turn-based; the first turn is decided by coin toss or rock-paper-scissors, whichever is more convenient.",

That's on their parents because they've become so 'busy' doing this or that because thats what they want their kids involved in, or those that complain McDonalds is making their kid fat, yet they take their kid there a few times a week because they're in a rush and can't make them good decent food. Younger people I come across these days are just downright rude and don't care about anything we have to pass along to them, claiming its not done that way anymore.....again back on the parents. I think if you punished your kids (I'm not saying abuse them) like we were back in the 30+ years ago, maybe they'd have more respect for others instead of this entitled attitude they all seem to have",

If I were a champ I would be slightly disappointed in myself for losing to a rookie, but I would feel humbled and definitely show respect to the opponent for winning.

Before it felt like the people that spend 100's of euros on ticket prices, were motorsport fans first and supported a driver or team second. \n\nThe outcry on behaviour of \"fans\" last weekend didn't come as a surprise for me as I've seen the change of the herd \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy would you use smoke bombs or those ship horns or wave huge flags and then blocking the view of others. Everyone spends a lot of money for an F1 ticket and with this kind of thing you start bothering other people who also want to watch the race undisturbed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe lack of tolerance from F1 fans towards each other and towards drivers is shocking. I had really hoped that this sport would not attract the same people who ruin other sports. They are undoubtedly exceptions, but it is a shame that they exist and especially that the Dutch spectator is put in a bad light. I think it is very good that drivers are speaking out against this. It is best to put out the fire when it is small.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIm curious how the reputation of the orange army is seen abroad? \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oo3no38edxa91.jpg?width=700&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bc5e47702e0ac171e2eca051f6df75d369f8eb09",
