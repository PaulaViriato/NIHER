                "Explosher\n\nClass: Bucket\n\nBased off: Portable Grill\n\nCompetitive Ranking: tier 6 (tier 1 = worst | tier 12 =best)\n\nCompetitive Position: Anchor\n\nSub: Point Sensor\n\nSpecial: ink storm\n\nThe explosher is a very slow weapon that makes up for it\u2019s paint radius. It shoots explosive hot piercing ink that can shoot through opponents. Once the ink makes contact with the ground, it explodes (this makes it possible to hit someone twice). Even if you manage to hit someone twice, the explosher still cannot fully kill them. Ink storm can come in handy in situations like these to easily finish off the minimal health the opponent has left. Point sensor makes it way easier to spot enemies behind walls, which explosher can counter. Explosher ink shots curve in an arch, allowing players to hit behind walls. This allows explosher to benefit from high ground, arch precision, and standing far away from opponents.\n\nHope this helps (:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pidxbxnhhffb1.jpeg?width=256&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b11d5ad5eef84f3438860c0b2923d4db07bcddff",

                ">While it's incredibly impactful, the blood geyser was not supposed to happen like that. For the effect, Tatsuya Nakadai had a hose hidden under his costume that was filled up with fake blood and put under 30 pounds of pressure. \n\n>However, when it came time to film the duel, a coupling in the hose broke. This meant that all of the blood was released at once instead of a smaller, more continuous flow of blood. The pressurized burst of blood was helped by the recipe of the fake blood itself: chocolate syrup diluted with sparkling water. \n\n>Diluted chocolate syrup was a common recipe for fake blood in black and white movies. It was similarly used in the shower scene in Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho. Despite it being a mistake, Akira Kurosawa loved the blood geyser and refused to reshoot the effect. It has since gone on to influence the entire action genre.",

The actor playing the protagonist, Toshiro Mifune, devised the climactic move, and had never rehearsed it in front of the other actors, who were truly stunned at how fast he was. Not even Tatsuya Nakadai, the guy he was facing off with, knew what he was going to do. When the actual blood spurt happened, the actors standing around witnessing the duel thought something had gone wrong and that he had actually killed the other actor.\n* The move was pulled off by drawing the sword out with the left hand (the cutting edge is always facing upward in a katana whose scabbard is worn tucked through the belt), twisting it so the cutting edge was facing inward, then using the back of the right hand to push the blade in an arc forward and outward. See the video. This was an entirely novel technique that Mifune came up with that was far faster than any conventional draw.\n* Mifune used a modified blade that was an inch or two shorter that what he used for the rest of the film to be able to safely pull off this move. Otherwise, the blade had a real risk of having the tip be dragged through his own abdomen as he swung it inward from the draw. He might not have been using a real sword, but he had to cut a pressurized blood tube worn by the other actor. The tip wasn't sharp, but they only had one chance to film that shot, and being gouged in the gut with even a blunt sword while pulling off that move would have ruined the scene.\n\nHere's an interview with Tatsuya Nakadai, who played the samurai who got cut down:\n\n# Criterion Collection | [Tatsuya Nakadai on Shooting SANJURO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQPnCD8Wj4E)",

Plus I overcame it all, but I still have to go for routinary blood tests. \n\nBut still I look away and think about something else, it isn't too bad.\n\nThen there's my younger brother, who is 8yrs younger, and has to be immobilized by at least three big adults when getting a vaccine...",

                "Undead Murder Farce was not at all what I expected.  \nWhat I expected: A cute comedy with a quirky talking head. I was expecting it to be more juvenile.\n\nWhat I got: Sherlock Holmes, but a human head in a birdcage who flirts relentlessly with her Watson, a half-demon psychopath. Also their dialog is the most mature flirting I've  seen in anime. Most anime flirting is aimed at teenagers without much experience, these two give off the 'yeah they fucked' vibe, which is ten time creepier and I'm in favor of it.",
                "Dark gathering is probably going to get more attention when the true plot starts to happen, or at least i hope so, the manga is pretty nice if you like horror and the anime is not far behind",
                "Honestly, **The Girl I like forgot her Glasses** is not exactly the case of GoHands ruining things for everyone. As much as I hate to admit it, I forgot how weak the early chapters of manga are. It's a typical case of a gimmick romcom being weak due to a bad gimmick and getting great once that gimmick is dropped.\n\nManga is easier to read, simply because you can skim through the problems. A quick, 3-6 minute read of a chapter gets turned into a 6-12 minute segment and all of the flaws suddenly get more apparent. Your brain cannot adapt them to your liking.\n\nI really love the manga - at some point it becomes incredibly pleasant to read when progression happens. I'd argue that GoHands are actually doing a good job (opening scene outside) at adapting... fairly weak (early on) source material. To make this show actually great they would have to drastically cut material from the manga or change the pacing to the one that doesn't annoy the viewers as much, essentially \"fixing\" the source material and this is always something controversial. It's a bit sad really.",

Without too many shows to watch I'm finally able to work through my backlog (Record of Ragnarok right now) and rewatch a personal favorite (HxH).",

                "Dark Gathering feels like an edgy late 2000s anime and I love it.",
                "For me at least, the most enjoyable anime of the summer 2023 season is The Masterful Cat is Depressed Again.\n\nIt\u2019s so sweet but also really funny. I hate cats, but I want a cat now and to call it Yukichi.\n\nWhen you have the cat threatening to beat his owners stupid face with a frying pan because she got drunk and fell sleep in the park, you know your in for a fun time.\n\n\nDark Gathering and Undead Girl Murder Farce were anime that I originally wasn\u2019t interested in, but after glowing reviews I gave them a try. Really solid anime\u2019s, especially Dark Gathering which has that really kooky comedy to it, but then shit gets really and twisted soon after.\n\nHelck is also a fav of mine. It\u2019s reminds me so much of He-Man, but if he was the bad guy.\n\nMost disappointing for me though is Liar Liar. Was looking forward to this one as it\u2019s right up my alley with MC fighting with games, but it\u2019s just not working for me. \n\nAlso recommended as great shows for me were Zom 100 and Vending Machine show.",

If you want a \"monogatari-lite\" anime, then **Undead Girl Murder Farce** is your pick, or rather my pick; it's been enjoyable throughout. Though most of the heavy lifting is done by the sequels, with **Mushoku Tensei** being excellent as always, and **jjk** s2 receiving a massive visual upgrade compared to s1.",
                "**Level 1 Demon Lord and One Room Hero** is my surprise pick of the season. I was expecting a one-trick-pony comedy, but it has characters I relate to, fun chemistry between its characters, and a plot that seems to be going places. \n\nFor some reason, I also put in the same mental bin alongside Helck; they're both about this sort of \"post fantasy hero\" setting where a demon lord gets defeated, but the hero has to find a place in the new landscape that they created. I think visually they both have this sort of 90s throwback feel to it that makes it distinct from the other series airing lately.",
                "Honestly feels like a fairly weak season, and that definitely comes through in how I talk about some of the anime here. \n\nCan\u2019t wait to find out what the flubs are this time. At least I got the header right, because I wind up with the wrong season at the top like 50% of the time.\n\nMy original plan for today was the Slice of Life poll results, but that\u2019s been shifted to tomorrow. Going to start doing results and polls on the same day to get the former promoting the latter.",

                "The Great Cleric is honestly pretty decent. Its a much slower take on an isekai, and so far the MC is still training, but hes not super OP, and he's not at all your typical isekai hero. Characters are enjoyable, and the slow approach has built a pretty decent foundation.\n\nHelck is a LOT of fun, people should definitely give it a go.",

                "I love this graphic you post each season. Thank you so much, OP.\n\nHere's a few thoughts about some anime I'm watching that no one asked for lol.\n\nFor anyone that hasn't started Masterful Cat, it's brilliant. Not going to win AOTY or anything, but definitely a unique, quirky show that's a fun watch. Definitely recommend. Saku is an adorably relatable MC.\n\nThis season has been weird for me. So many anime I went into very interested in but so many that I've dropped as well, which I don't do often, like Tiny Senpai, Yohane the Parhelion, and Ryza no Thighs. \n\nOn that note, I want to like Dark Gathering so badly but I just can't get into it. Idk what it is about the show, it's like they took an interesting story concept and found the most boring way to tell it. None of the characters are interesting, the MC is cliche, and Yayoi is just _there_. I'm going to sit this one out for a while and maybe catch up if I hear a lot of good things about it as the story progresses. It's tough to devote myself to ~25 episodes when I can't get into the first 4-5.\n\nI kind of feel that same way about Helck but I see myself continuing this one. It's been extremely one-dimensional so far, with Hon carrying the first couple episodes. Without him in the last couple episodes I feel like the overall quality has shifted and it's become just another standard fantasy anime. I'm hoping it improves with the most recent development. The dark, demon-world environment of browns, purples, and blacks with no real detail in the backgrounds was getting dull, imo.\n\nI'm not quite sure where I stand with Synduality Noir. I like it, it's fun and unique, but it hasn't quite grabbed me yet. \n\nThe Most Heretical Last Boss Queen has been surprisingly good. It's wholesome in some ways, but also pretty cliche in others. I think it's unique enough that it can stand apart from the seasonal isekai trash we get each quarter. The MC is extremely self-aware, and the way she uses her \"power\" of foresight to navigate her timeline differently than what fate would have is pretty cool. \n\nLastly, My Happy Marriage might just be anime of the season for me. I did not go into this expecting much more than your typical romance and ended up falling in love with Miyo's character. Voice acting in both Sub and Dub are fantastic but I'm _really_ liking Miyo's English voice\u2014and I typically always watch Sub the first time I watch an anime.\n\n...And of course I'm absolutely loving Jujustu Kaisen, ZOM 100, Mushoku Tensei, and Undead Murder Farce. All four are incredible shows with beautiful animation. Not much needs to be said about these four juggernauts.\n\n^(I completely forgot Devil is a Part Timer was airing this season...)",
                "How's Level 1 Demon lord and One room hero? The mini review here is giving me The Devil is a Part Timer s1 vibes, and I'd love something like that again (I know the sequels are happening, they're just so... eh). Otherwise, I tend to hate the whole isekai, Demon king trope.",
                "It may just be me, but is there a lot less dubs available for the big titles this season than usual? Is it due to the SAG strikes?",
                "Some good new shows but yeah generally weak as usual for Summer. \n\nBut the sequels have been amazing so far JJK, Mushoku, Bleach, BSD and  Horimiya! Rent a Girlfriend has also been decent lol",
                " \u201cBanG Dream It\u2019s MyGo\u201d  It is my  anime of the season. If you liked Bocchi The Rock this is he spirit successor. \n\nGreat characters, music presentation used as character development and an interesting misters plot. \n\nAlso one of the best representation of an autistic female lead, just like chainsaw man part 2. \n \nIt has everything.",

It is simply astounding how good this show is.  Each epsiode ends and you wish the next episode was ready.  This is the kind of show that makes you want to wait so you can binge the whole season when it's done while also not wanting to do that because you know you'll be waiting a long time for that.\n\n**Am I Actually the Strongest** is surprisingly watchable.  I thought it would be as bland as last season's Aristocrat show, but there's a certain level of fun that this show is.  It's not must watch, but for trashy isekai, you could do a looooooot worse.  The MC is actually kinda entertaining to watch him try to weasel his way out of any responsibilities and then turn around and puts forth effort when things really matter.",

ZOM 100 had a great first episode but hasn't really found it's footing for me, though I'm hoping the most recent episode maybe helps give an emotional turning point to push things along. \n\nMurder Farce has been fun, but definitely a weird show in that Episode 1 seems to set-up a completely different show. I'm not disappointed that it's a mystery/detective show, but wasn't it expecting it (having not read the manga nor spent any time looking into before watching). \n\nEven my top 2 new shows are pretty good but not great (yet), so hoping Fall 2023 picks things up.

Thicc Thighs save lives.\n- Level 1 Demon Lord - Surprisingly adorable couple compared to other romance anime genre.\n- The Most Heretical Last Boss - Any anime with Fairouz AI (Pride's seiyuu) is no.1 for me.

Moments where you'd say, \"I didn't think you'd be this cute in person.\"\n- Sweet Reincarnation - I'm a fan of Murase Ayumu (Iruma-kun)\n- Jitsu wa Ore Saikyou - This series is basically, Anya Reincarnated in Another World As A Neet And Forcing My Big Brother To Become A Super Hero.\n\n\nEverything just feels meh and or too much sex. Then there are only two anime summer 2023 where mentioning sex wouldn't sound bad because that's almost the premise of the whole story.\n- Mushoku Tensei - either Rudy deals with his erectile dysfunction or Elinase gets busy with everyone at the bathroom stall.\n- Zom100 - Landing a hoe apparently turns them into zombies.",

                "Isekai Review from an Isekai Garbage Connoisseur\n\nVending Machine is actually really strong for an isekai. It\u2019s great for any typical isekai garbage connoisseur. It has a surprisingly disciplined and unique power/leveling system and has really legitimately funny moments at times. Great Cleric is also a solid isekai for people who like them with so far pretty disciplined levelling.\n\nMost Heretical Last Boss Queen I had really low expectations for going in - it sounded like a literal copypaste of My Next Life as a Villainness but it\u2019s surprisingly more different than I expected with a much more serious tone. It\u2019s definitely not as good as it but if you liked Bookworm you might enjoy this.\n\nSweet Reincarnation is pretty bad. Anybody who liked Campfire Cooking and was hoping for something like that but for baking will be disappointed. There\u2019s almost zero focus on being a pastry chef with a lot of the focus being poorly animated action sequences and stuff. Dude baked a single apple pie in 4 episodes and it was an afterthought he did in like 2 minutes. It\u2019s clear this show isn\u2019t going to try to focus on it any more than that.\n\nUnique Skill is fine. It\u2019s similar to Fruit of Evolution type but this is a bit better. The dungeon/power system feels unique. For now. There is no discipline in this levelling system. The dude will\ndefinitely be broken by end of season.\n\nAm I Actually the Strongest is not very good but not as bad as Sweet Reincarnation. Mushoku Tensei at home would be a generous take.",

Of course **Link Click** doesn\u2019t count around here and I\u2019m only one, of like 5 people, keeping up with **Ayaka**. \n\n**JJK** and **Bungo** are both series where I enjoyed the previous seasons and I\u2019m loving the new season even more. And the same with **Horimiya**. I just love being back in the world and seeing the everyday lives of all the characters. Their interactions are the best thing about the series and we are just getting more of that with this season.\n\n**Undead Murder Farce** is probably my surprise series of the season. I always have one series where I wouldn\u2019t normally check it out but for some reason I did and I end up loving it. This show wasn\u2019t even on my radar until the first episode aired and they dropped the last promo visual. But from that first episode, the way they play with the visuals in the episode, and the banter and chemistry the leads have with each other has had me hooked on the series. \n\n**Reign of the Seven Spellblades** blends my love of magic and swords so of course I\u2019d be interested in this. I\u2019m still amused by how the main 6 characters are  practically just one half of each of the main Harry Potter trio.\n\nThe last series I\u2019ve gotten into is **My Happy Marriage**. I was a little late on this because I generally don\u2019t like watching anime on Netflix. But this is very much my type of series. And with everyone talking about it I caved and booted up my Netflix to check it out and I\u2019m so glad I did. The relationship between Miyo and Kudo is just the sweetest.

It might be me, but I doubt it since I have too many other projects going on.\n\n**Masamune's Revenge S2** is okay, but honestly feels like it should wrap up now.\n\n**My Happy Marriage** is very, very obvious in its emotional manipulation and rescue complex nonsense, but well written enough\n\n**Kenshin**, so far I prefer the original and the live action. Still watching for now, but may just stop and wait a couple years for the thing to be done.\n\n**Dreaming Boy is a Realist** had the potential to be good, deconstructing the unhealthy obsessions of fandom, etc, but seems to have slowed down into nothing and not really leaned into anything beside the usual.\n\n**JJK** is decent. It is the same show as S1 basically. \n\n---\n\nStuff I am not watching or dropped\n\n**MT** - everything I read about it makes it uninteresting to me\n\n**Tenpuru** - not as good as QQ, not as good as Goddess Cafe\n\n**Zom 100** - if the first episode is peak, it didn't manage to capture me at all, so pass\n\n**Dark Gathering** - slow, slow start.

There's also some rare instances of the dub completely changing the story outright for various reasons, which is always a pretty big risk.\n\nSo the subtitle elitism is mostly due to retaining consistent quality/translation, as the dub world at times can feel like you're gambling on the voice work quality. You never really know if a dub is a proper dub until you've watched the same thing subbed, which in that case you'd probably prefer watching the show once unless you're a super fan.",

The Cyberpunk and Space genres have also been heavily reduced to maybe 1 or 2 series every year. \n\nThe other thing is that Shonen protags no longer want to be \"the best\" at something. Very few (if any) of the current popular shonen have protags have lofty goals. I will say though that it was never really a trope if you look at it from a wide net, but it was associated with Battle Shonens more than anywhere else yet it was never that prevalent and is even LESS prevalent now.

Damn. Plus at least deserved *that* much.\n\nSince I\u2019m here and didn\u2019t get to vote I might as well do *some* sort of public service wrt a soundtrack that I love that *did* at least make the Top 100: I\u2019m sure most Symphogear voters did so on the strength of the vocal songs, but I also want to point out that Symphogear\u2019s *score* is *supremely* underappreciated. It\u2019s about as good on average as the inserts are I\u2019d wager, and I really want to emphasize that even if we *were* voting on score alone, Symphogear would still *absolutely* have gotten my vote (if I were a competent human being) and deserved yours. Here are a few highlights (be warned, **thumbnails may contain spoilers**):\n\n- [Sakamaku Keppuu](https://youtu.be/qNx7iWjPea8)\n\n- [Kotonoha wa\u2026](https://youtu.be/4-uFud9l-nA)\n\n- [BARK at the MOON (Maky\u016b Ichaival)](https://youtu.be/tmrxlXVTUhA)\n\n- [the MOON is a harsh mistress](https://youtu.be/C41U7ALparY)\n\n- [S2CA/Voltage Maximum](https://youtu.be/JMVyHbc_yCU)\n\n- [wield a Disrupt Hammer](https://youtu.be/vZ-lrL7uphU)\n\n- [Daisan no Shoujo\u2026](https://youtu.be/1B_-LzBpVYM)\n\n- [the WILD BUNCH](https://youtu.be/OQnHjgbRQz4)\n\n- [Sassou taru Sousha](https://youtu.be/uYdTwhSpVQA)\n\n- [A song doesn\u2019t die.](https://youtu.be/TpjIcuTFo5s)",

Still, I think the results are reasonably indicative of r/anime\u2019s general opinions, so at least it mostly worked.

I could definitely be wrong though, it's been a very long time since I watched it.\n\nI definitely need to rewatch Madoka Magica again and this gives me the perfect excuse. I was too focused on the craziness of that show that I don't think I paid enough attention to the OST.\n\nI'm curious what the original post stated as an \"OST\", how it asked the question to the poll. Imo, an OST is all music in a show, the into, outro, _and_ all the music being played during the show whether background or foreground. \n\nIt seems a lot of the results were based solely on people voting for the best OP/ED because there's very little music _during_ the show for a lot of these. I _loved_ Love is War, but outside the OP/ED there wasn't really an OST and yet it ranked 61 best OST of all time, lol. Could probably say the same thing about Steins;Gate.

Tower of God only being 34th is the biggest surprise result, and none of his other OSTS (ex. Shield Hero, Eden) received a single vote. I was convinced there'd be at least some voters who would vote for all the Penkin OSTs, since any time the OST category gets brought up during awards seasons, many people say \"[insert OST by Penkin] deserves to win because Kevin Penkin\" (and that's the only reason they list).\n\n* It is quite interesting to see how older anime stack up against recent anime, how OSTs from different years rank against each other in this cumulative ranking, etc.. I don't really know anything about OSTs nor which ones were popular (outside of the ones nominated in the awards), so this was a fun read to consume.",

The ethereal vibes you get on this OST is so well done; you really feel like you are in the presence of a divine being. \n\nIrregular God is such an amazing track for example, I think it perfectly encapsulates the TOG. The choir and background synths makes you really feel as if you\u2019re \u201crising,\u201d sorta like how every time you climb the floors in TOG, you get closer to Jihad. \n\nIgnition and Black March are also amazing. Penkin was able to perfectly capture how powerful Green April and Black March swords are. The swords are beautiful and the beings that live in them are even prettier, but also are somewhat scary for how strong they can be. I feel like these tracks match that vibe, with their beautiful choruses, yet thumping beats that ensure afterwards. \n\nTOG\u2019s soundtrack doesn\u2019t beat Made in Abyss\u2019 OST imo, but TOG is definitely at least TOP 5 for me in terms for most unique and beautiful sounding soundtrack as well as being able to PERFECTLY emulate the TOG universe.",

Hopefully the novel eventually gets a translation after the anime finishes.  \n\n\nSpy Classroom is legit good this season. Last 2 episodes have been great and this season looks very promising. I doubt people will want to give it a chance after the first 3 episodes, but the SoL episodes after it were just the placement of them was weird. I thought the 2nd arc with Grethe was good.",

The action and comedy are actually similar to JJK but they are never dragged out too unnecessarily. \nAlso it\u2019s a seinen so lots of characters and their relationships are morally gray.

The stakes just got upped, AGAIN. And this time it's crazy! IDK how they good guys are going to \"fix\" things now! This reminded me powerfully of the feeling I got from watching Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, which, until now, was the best anime where the stakes just kept getting higher and higher.

We had the shopping episode, now the getting dressed episode, the to be hubby looking stunned at her \"glow up\" reveal, blushing and jealousy. Pass the popcorn ... wait is the episode over? AARG!\n\n**#3 Zom 100** \\- another great episode. Lots of highs, lows and entertainment.

Guilty Crown 2 times. And Familiar of Zero 2 times(all 4 seasons). In 2011&2012 I've started to get into anime by watching Inuyasha, Ranma 1/2 and Saint Seiya. Would likely have rewatched them already if they were shorter, as I did with The Lost Canvas. Since then I haven't really watched the same anime repeatedly, except Steins;Gate again in 2017 in preparation for the 2018 Steins;Gate 0 anime. Also back in 2018 I've watched Devilman Crybaby, which became a favorite. Ended up rewatching that and the first season of Psycho Pass(which I haven't watched in 7 years) during the pandemic(2020). Further still back in 2018 I have rewatched Re:Zero a few times while in groups. (Back in 2019 and 2020 I didn't watch seasonal anime, was busy, so no Demon Slayer or Jujutsu Kaisen here).",

                "Week 5 of Summer and to my surprise **Mushoku Tensei** managed to take the top spot from **Jujutsu Kaisen** as that closes out its first arc and goes into a break.\n\n**Undead Girl Murder Farce** and **My Happy Marriage** did both end up losing their streak of increasing karma afterall even though the former came pretty close to extending it by one more week and fell just 39 upvotes short.\n\nGood to see that **Am I Actually The Strongest** took the break well and reentered at 22nd. Definitely one of the most fun shows this season if you embrace the nonsense.\n\nBtw it's crazy to see a show with 353 karma getting into the top 15 so early in the season.",
                "I'm kind of surprised that JJK Episode only got 4961 Karma.  It was a really well done episode.\n\nIt will be interesting to see whether One Piece can hold down the #2 spot in its absence.  I was hoping for a little more from last night's episode, but it should have the #2 spot next week for sure.",

Perfect time to watch the 4 sleepers of the season!\n\n- **Undead Girl Murder Farce** is a blast. Classic mystery of the arc format with an overall plot. A who\u2019s who of literary characters. Electric chemistry between the leads. Hypnotic dialogue. All animated like a Shaft show (minus head tilts). Surprise of the season. \n\n- **My Happy Marriage** has been a lovely drama with a sweet core romance. That just so happens to have a sick power system and intrigue. Little something for everyone. \n\n- **Helck** is a gag manga. Super silly at times. Surely won\u2019t be anything deeper no sir. But you should totally invest in it because the anime is great so far. \n\n- **Dark Gathering** is a fucked up horror show with a SATAM personality. A creepy ass show that still manages to nail some over the top. Plus HanaKana is the love interest and she\u2019s gonna have some fun with this one. \n\nIt\u2019s a slower season so fill up your time with these great shows.",

I am really enjoying this remake so far. **Dark Gathering** also deserves that jump considering that unsettling final scene.\n\nAnd I was hoping **Atelier Ryza** would jump up higher after the beach episode but Top 15 is still good!",

Didn't come out of nowhere either, there's logic to it. I felt some scenes had wonky animation, then it's back to being beautiful. Was it an artistic choice or budget issues?\n* \\#3 **Zom 100** \\- actually had the highest highs and lowest lows of all the episodes I watched this week. What an exciting show.\n* \\#5 **Undead Girl Murder Farce** \\- Holy CAMEOS from many characters from beloved stories!! YESSSS!!! < internal cheering intensifies >\n* \\#6 **My Happy Marriage** \\- this ... had everything I want in a Romance Anime. Awesome!\n* \\#7 **Helck** \\- Happy to see this in the top! Most reminiscent of the feeling I got from watching Mashle, it's just satisfying and fun. (Still would like better animation).\n\nEverything from #9 onwards had less than 1000 votes. Is this normal? Why are some of these not being watched more?\n\n* \\#10 **Seven Spellblades** \\- this took a dark, dark turn!\n* \\#11 **Bungo Stray Dogs** \\- I haven't seen any anime do the \"stakes keep getting higher\" bit as well as BDS S5. It's amazing and gave me the same vibes as I last got from TTGL. I don't even know how the heroes will save things now. Ranpo, we need you to come up with something, fast. Plot wise, this is the top anime of the season so far.\n* \\#12 **Dark Gathering** \\- This actually FELT like a real Urban Legend Ghost Story! Genuinely creepy, I was huddled under my blanket regretting the fact that I am watching it at night, since I screamed a few times. Everyone looks so \"cutesy\" and then HORROR. More people should watch this.\n\nShout out to fellow kitty fans of the Masterful cat. I want him, or a cat like him, I guess I have to be satisfied with an anime.",

I'm not saying I hate these three shows but I think they were more anticipated prior to the start of the summer season.      \nOne series I do like \"Yohane the Parhelion\" seems to have disappeared without a trace, probably because of its Love Live connection.

                "Portrayals of Japanese high school in the animated medium are entirely accurate.",
                "Like most media, it takes common stuff and amplifies it into a trope. For instance, do kids at American schools actually give swirlies and put other kids in trash cans? Not really, at least not anywhere near common enough to be a thing (and in my entire school life at a public American school, never saw once). But, bullying does still happen, and the trope is a lighthearted way to get across those ideas in media.\n\nThe \u201cindirect kiss\u201d might be something some kids somewhere did, but it\u2019s mostly an amplified trope, to make a lighthearted poke at young and misunderstood romance.",

                "I think it's just a human, young-teens-first-romance kind of thing. I've heard the same concept and remember thinking about it as a kid and I live in Poland",
                "Lived there for 8 years, it is a thing but not as much as anime makes it out to be. My gf, now wife, would mention it if we shared a coffee, etc. She said it was something you'd only really care about if you liked someone. Kinda makes sense- you'd just refuse to put your mouth on whatever it was otherwise. It's quite a sickness-adverse culture, so they notice it more. \nAnother thing that exists is staff at stores giving change with 2 hands, ostensibly so they can catch any that falls but I ended up getting 'stroked' (on my out stretched hand, lol) more often than not. But I don't know if there is a name for that, never seen it in an anime.\nAnother is valentines day chocolate is usually homemade by teens and young adults. Never had anything dicey put in that I know of, but a guy I worked with found quite a bit of hair in his... I've seen that somewhere in anime, can't recall where.",
                "If you truly want to compare japanese culture with anime and real life, go watch some jp shows, either soap operas that are set in modern times (specifically ones that arent anime adaptations) or any talk or comedy shows. even if most of them dont involve high school students you'll eventually get a grasp of their culture and find out if what we see in anime is either exaggerated or true to life.\n\nand dont worry, a good number of talk/comedy shows have translations.\n\nWatching a country's shows that isn't cartoon is a good way to understand how they think and act",
                "I mean I kinda think about it irl and I'm Aussie, I used to think about it even before I watched anime and knew it as a trope.",
                "In my country, this sentiment kind of exists but it\u2019s more for hygienic reasons. People don\u2019t go like \u201comg indirect kiss\u201d and the sentiment is more like it\u2019s just not hygienic to drink from the same bottle as someone else. Some people don\u2019t mind it but people who mind it are such because of hygienic reasons.",

I do not drink even after my boyfriend, not typical. Getting flustered when I do, because I think of it as a indirect kiss ; he also teases me lightly.\n\nI think Manga and Anime certainly makes it a big deal, but I do not mind.",
                "Yes. And Japanese people also bleed buckets out of their nose whenever they get even mildly aroused.",

                "Yeah it\u2019s a thing. Not to the extent of anime, but the concept is known by pretty much everyone. I doubt anyone places as much importance on it as rom-com protagonists do, but I\u2019m sure some boys get excited when they share food or drink with their crush. And I\u2019ve totally experienced teasing about it with siblings/friends. Something like \u201cpass me your water bro.\u201d \u201cNah I ain\u2019t indirectly kissing you.\u201d Or something like that. It\u2019s not cringe when you\u2019re a teen.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s a thing because anime keeps it alive. People see the shows talking about indirect kisses and now they talk about them.",
                "In Japan is it a thing where every time you say something embarrassing to your crush a train suddenly goes past or there's a dramatic gust of wind or even if you said it completely audibly your crush has temporary hearing loss right at that second? At which point you hit them with the *nandemo nai* and they never push you to actually repeat yourself even though it's clear you said something very important? \n\nIf so how does Japan Railways Group sync up their timetable schedules to ensure that whenever a teenager confesses that they have a train ready to pass by right at that second?",
                "idk but me some marines and JDSF people at one point shared a canteen of water and they weren't reserved about it either. We also passed around a flask around the camp fire too. That was a lot of men doing a lot of indirect kissing if that's the case.",
                "I, a Japanese, come here to see how everyone thinks.",
                "I don't know how much of it is 'real', but the thing is that... It can actually snowball into reality;\n\nIf I had to drink from my crush's cup/glass, I might think nothing of it... But if right before I drank, someone told me \"Hey, your crush's lips were on that!\", then I may become a bit more conscious about it, and just thinking about it would actually make it a bit more of a flustering experience.\n\nI mean it's not even about the \"indirect kiss\" thing, it could be anything; If I was to sit on a chair and someone told me \"My crush's ass was on that chair so it's like our butts are touching\", it could be a little embarrassing, not because \"our butts are touching\" (which is silly, because even if that was a thing, a thousand other butts touched that chair before), but simply because I'm now thinking about our butts touching and all.\n\nSo I think this may be what's happening; It's not really that it's an indirect kiss, it's that \"you're now thinking about an indirect kiss\", and the fact that it's flustering you, makes you realize it even more, and so on.\n\nSo basically it's just the idea of the thing, that makes it more \"real\". And given it's a trope in anime, well the idea is way more present in Japan.",

                "It was a thing at least like 10 years ago when I was in school there!",
                "it is actually common even outside Japan. the difference is that outside Japan, they will only tease it on persons who are romantically related to each other. while in Japan, it is like a big deal that even not romantically related are conscious about it.",
                "I\u2019m not Japanese, but I remember when I was younger, if I shared a water bottle with a girl that I had a HUGE crush on. I kind of cherished the moment a little more than if shared it with my bro lol",

But it's more like teens dealing with their lives more than existential dread. Its 1 season complete story (season 2 is coming but is just stuff they skipped the first time through. Not knowing if they were getting a second season.) it's a little horny. But not overtly.",

Romance wise some of my favorites are Tomo Chan is a Girl because its rather unique, has a story that actually feels realistic, funny and yet emotional heart-warming moments and a lovely cast of characters.\n\nSpy X Family is also quite nice since a few People told you to watch it but id rather recommend Buddy Daddies.

It's understandable, especially as a first anime.\n\nI'd recommend Konosuba. It'll definitely cheer you up. One of my favorite shows and you can't go wrong with the sub or the dub, so pick whichever you like because they're both fantastic. It's a comedy \"reincarnation into a fantasy world\" isekai where the MC is pretty much useless but his party is just as useless as him. Hijinx ensue. This isn't the type of anime I typically watch, but it's in my top 3 because it's so good and the characters are charming and lovable.\n\nMy other recommendation would be \"Love, Chunibyo, & Other Delusions\". Comedy, romance, slice of life. It's funny and cute but touches on some deeper subjects like the loss of loved ones and the coping mechanisms we create to deal with it. It's not a sad show, overall it's happy, funny, and cute, but there are times that you might tear up because you feel for the characters of the story but it's like a good cry.\n\nLastly, Yuru Camp (Laid Back Camp). Just a relaxing show about a group of girls that like camping. It's a slice of life, \"cute girls doing cute things\"-type anime. No drama, no sadness, just a fun, risk-free show. Super enjoyable.",

                "Man so many people really miss the point of Made in Abyss. Its primary theme is about the triumph of the human spirit through tragedy and adversity, and how even nonhuman beings can find their own humanity. You should feel an uplifting catharsis when you finish a season of it, not despair. I found shows like Cowboy Bebop, Akudama Drive, Plastic Memories, and Akame ga Kill to be far heavier in how they ended personally. I think it's understandable for you to be left feeling confused by it though since you don't have a lot of experience.\n\nIf you want shows that are just more about goofy fun though watch stuff like Konosuba, Spy x Family, Bocchi the Rock, Kaguya-sama, and Cautious Hero. These shows will also occasionally have serious moments that tug at your heartstrings and provide deep contrast to the top tier comedy.\n\nI also highly recommend eventually watching Eighty-Six if you want another gut punch similar to MiA, but this one ends on a much clearer high note that I think may help you gain more insight into how tragedy and suffering can be used to illustrate inspiring stories about the human spirit.\n\nAnd Re:Zero is the GOAT but don't rush into it before you're ready for it.

Yakuza officer is celebrating his winning bid on a collectable ceramic pot. He gets clinked in the head by a capsule that contains a little girl. After releasing her, he discovers that she has psychokinetic powers. While there are a lot of sub plots, the main story is a slice of life about a Yakuza and raising this kid as his daughter.",

It is extremely violent and profane though. (Not disturbingly gory, though there is an episode where a character is in a bad mood and takes it out by slaughtering a ship full of neo-nazis.) If you do watch it though, watch the dub. There's three seasons. The first 2 are around 12 episodes, the third is 6 I think. Last I checked the manga was unfinished because the creator switches between working on the manga, working on the anime, and drawing doujins.",

                "Zenitsu for sure, I mean like >!the manga ended pretty abruptly in my opinion, and there was obviously a lot of storybeats that got glossed over. I think one of the main points was Zenitsu's character arc, because while at the end the manga does try to redeem him, it's really sudden. We only see his training classmate(?) one time before he's demonized (without counting him in Gyomei's backstory), and the impact of seeing everything happen kindve fell really short for me. I want to see Zenitsu grow past the crying, unconfident, low self esteem person he's been for a long time. I had been cheering for him the whole time and waiting to see him improve, and it really fell short for me. Also, it would be cool to see him have more fights where he isn't fighting while asleep/passed out.!<\n\nEdit: Forgot to elaborate. The reason I feel people will like him better in the anime rather than the manga (when the anime gets to that point) is because the anime has been including more context than the manga so far. It's also been rumored that the light novels are going to have an influence on the anime as well. Overall, I feel like this gives them a second chance to do a lot of things over, and I hope that Zenitsu's character arc is going Togo over better",

So I remembered that I started this show called Steins;gate as it was recommended a lot, I also remember that my 12 year old self thought it was weird. So I thought this would be a good opportunity to check if it really wasn't for me or if it was just not for 12 yr old me who was addicted to action anime. \n\nSo, I started watching. It starts off weird, the scenery is just white. It definitely doesn't feel like your usual anime. Then after the first plot point happens (long story short the main cast discover time travel) I just get hooked. Normally the main cast gets to know everything in some way or another and actually get introduced to their enemy early on. But this anime doesn't do that, the characters just live normally now with the inclusion of time travel experiments. But as the plot progresses everything feels more off. You can feel that the cast is digging themselves deeper into danger, and the characters feel it too. \n\nAnyway, long story short.

Only after finishing the show and looking at the reviews did I realize that most people hated the animation. I strongly recommend it if you want to feel strong emotions and experience a thought provoking psychological thriller. Preferably through the manga since the anime only has 12 episodes and is not completed. Episode 7 for me is the moment that I keep thinking about years now after watching it.\n\n\nHyouka\n\n- For the complete opposite reason from the last anime. It was pure bliss and surreality watching this. I appreciated it even more after discovering the numerous video essays on hyouka.

It has the same traits as Makoto Shinkai\u2019s other films like \u2018Your Name\u2019, \u20185 centimetres\u2026\u2019 etc - I.e. strong character journeys and coming of age vibe, magic realism elements, gorgeous animation and indie soundtrack - but with its reference to a certain real-life tragic Japanese event it\u2019s particularly heavy on the pathos and the \u2018feels\u2019.

Spoilers for anyone who hasn\u2019t watched / read but\u2026\n\nI remember when Luffy was fighting Hordy on Fishman island and someone asked Hordy why he hates humans so much? What they\u2019ve done to him? Keep in mind that, at this point, Hordy is doped up on a serious steroid that changed his hair white, has assembled an army to both take over Fishman island via a coup that included publicity executing the royal family, and fully intended to declare war on all humans.\n\nHis answer: \u201cnothing.\u201d\n\nHordy and his main conspirators grew up in the slums of Fishman island. As children, they met former slaves, former pirates, etc. They all had stories about the cruelty of humans. Hordy and his crew grew up hearing these stories and it led to them despising humans to the point that they were willing to shorten their lives with drugs and kill anyone (including their own people) in their quest to return the suffering that the Fishman race had endured. They had no personal experience with human cruelty. There was no remorse, no doubt, not a moment of hesitation, just pursuit of their single-minded hatred. \n\nIt really brought home the idea of the endless circle of hatred and the true harm that it can cause. \n\nThat is only one small moment in One Piece. The whole show is about freedom in its purest form. Honestly greatest story ever told in my opinion. Very raw and real in parts, makes you laugh and cry.

                "I have a few: \n\nSoulburner vs Revolver was freaking amazing! It had good dialog, great dueling action and a satisfying way to finish the character arcs for both Revolver and Soulburner \n\nLightning vs Specter for the freaking Extra Link Full Mode and the incredible faces that Specter was making \n\n\nSora vs Shun like the OP said\n\nPossessed Jesse vs Zane, the dueling action is fantastic and the end is heartbreaking. Same goes for Playmaker vs Ai",
                "Yugi vs Yami. The plays and counterplays that came from knowing each other so well, combined with the separation of the two giving a view of each playstyles after so long of only knowing how they play together.",
                "Jack vs Yusei final duel\n\nA duel so iconic they referenced it in RDA\u2019s Scarlight form",
                "Sora vs Shun was epic AF, this duel pretty much showed us how easily roles can swap in this franchise.",
                "I don't think I could pick just one.  Here are some of my favorites.\n\nJoey vs. Marik: While Joey did lose this one, it was only by a technicality.  He took EVERYTHING that Marik threw at him and even found ways around some of Marik's tricks.  In the Japanese version, Kaiba silently acknowledges Joey as a true duelist after the match.\n\nI'm afraid I don't really have one for GX.  I need to finish watching it first.\n\nTeam 5D's vs. Team Taiyou: In the in-universe history of Duel Monsters, nobody had ever done what Team Taiyou had set out to do: Summon Zushin the Sleeping Giant.  Even in all their matches they won that led to them qualifying for the quarter finals of the WRGP, they never got to summon it.  I loved how it was sort of like a mystery during the duel that Team 5D's was trying to solve and that Jack's instincts are so sharp he quickly worked out that defending and burning wasn't their goal.  I also love that Leo figured out what card they were aiming for shortly after Yusei.\n\nYuma & Astral vs. Nash: The penultimate duel of the series was perhaps the most epic, but also the most tragic.  Both Yuma and Shark wanted to use the Numeron Code to save people they cared about, but they still had to fight for it since Shark, as Nash, could only think to save the Barian World by destroying the Astral World.  The most tragic part about the entire duel was exactly how Yuma described it: He and his best friend were shredding each other.  At the end of it all, however, the one who was NOT consumed by the power of Chaos was Yuma, because he refused to sacrifice anyone for the sake of power.  Nash's final play became his undoing: His Trap would have made him lose if he didn't play the card he drew, but that card ended up changing his LP to zero because there was no change to Yuma's LP.\n\nYuya vs. Shinji: I'll admit that Sora vs Shun is an epic Action Duel, and definitely a favorite of mine, but I'm also really fond of Yuya's duel against Shinji.  It's here that he begins to understand the philosophy of Synchro Summoning and that even a card that damages its user can be a winner.  The creation of Enlightenment Paladin would lead Yuya to creating Nirvana High Paladin in his rematch with Jack, and to the revelation of what Synchro Summoning is all about: Individual voices are weak, but together they are amplified and powerful.\n\nPlaymaker vs. Revolver (2nd Master Duel): This one became an epic, no-holds-barred brawl between these two duelists.  Revolver creating the show's first Extra Link, using it to push Playmaker to the lowest amount of LP any protagonist has ever had (13!), and the incredible turnaround of Playmaker using the Extra Link to win in a single blow were all just EPIC!  I would like to note one thing, though: Revolver had Playmaker DEAD TO RIGHTS, but he misplayed when he was building the Extra Link.  If he had used up the counters on his Link Turret card first and then sent THAT to the GY for Borrelguard Dragon's effect instead of Mirror Force, Playmaker would never have been able to use that one Trap Card that copied it.  Having that Trap in his GY is what allowed him to win.\n\nLuke vs. Tiger: For all the crap SEVENS gets, it's actually not a terrible show.  A lot of the duels are really spectacular, and the music is some of the best I've ever heard from a YGO show.  Luke dueling against his older sister felt like a sort of \"rite of passage\" for him.  And yes, I know it's annoying that Luke pretty much went undefeated until the very last episode, but this is one of his victories that I feel like he EARNED.\n\nYudias vs. Zwijo (Battleship Duel): This one was EPIC!  Zwijo showcases his power in spectacular fashion and even fuses his ace with the new, terrifying Voidvelgr monster he played in that duel!  However, Yudias hung on and kept fighting for everyone's sake after Zwijo revealed not only WHY he did what he did, but what his plan was to make the Velgearians into real people.  I feel like this Rush Duel did a better job of the \"power of friends\" thing than the Yuga vs. Otes battle at the end of SEVENS, especially with Yudias's friends piloting ships to provide power to the monsters themselves.  The last turn was epic and heartfelt as well, and I just can't get enough of it!",
                "Sora vs Shun is way up there, definitely. As is Yuya vs Yuri and Yuya vs Reiji round 2 from the same series (for all of season 3's problems, that final grudge match with Yuri and having Yuya fight against his possession was an excellent time).\n\nI have such a hard time choosing, here. For now I'm thinking either Yami vs Kaiba in Battle City (manga) or pretty much ever Revolver duel up to where I'm at in Vrains (just wrapped up the Kusanagi duel, rn). Yami vs Kaiba is Takahashi at his best in terms of scale and strategy, whereas Revolver turns Vrains from okay to a 10/10 every time he's on screen for so many reasons, and his duels are no different.",

                "Unrelated but the prompt image is something i need to complain about:\n\nEvery series from Classic all the way up to current, a regular reoccurring thing is where someone makes a jab at someone who summons a monster with no / low ATK / DEF.  And then the person who summoned it smirks and is like \u201cit has a special ability that\u2019s going to cause you problems\u201d and the person who made the smack talk to start suddenly is like \u201cOh no!\u201d\n\nLike has NOBODY IN THE ANIME PLAYED THIS GAME BEFORE?  Obviously nobody is summoning a monster with obscenely low attack points without a special ability (besides Joey), everything\u2019s got a special ability but everyone seems surprised when someone else uses a special ability",
                "The second-to-last major duel of Zexal: Yuma vs. Nasch. Don Thousand was just a BBEG, so there was no question about defeating him, but Nasch is an *actual character*, with genuine ideology and loyalty behind his actions, and even when that loyalty seems to demand that he fight Yuma for the sake of his people, you can sorta sympathize with him for making that decision.\n\nNasch is also one of the smartest duelists in Zexal, and with his Barian Emperor deck fully assembled, he\u2019s got one of the most varied and deadly arsenals in the whole series. This also makes Nasch a test of Yuma\u2019s strategic ability \u2014 the same ability he\u2019s going to be tested on in the true final duel of Zexal. It helps that he doesn\u2019t cheat nearly as much as Don Thousand did.\n\nAnd finally, there\u2019s the poetry of it all: Yuma\u2019s first real opponent has somehow become his last, because of how they\u2019ve both grown and changed over the whole series, and because they both represent so much more than schoolyard grudges in this fight- they\u2019re the champions of entire worlds now. It\u2019s the same duel, but it\u2019s so much bigger\u2026 and this time it\u2019s for keeps.\n\nYuma vs. Astral was a really appropriate way to bring back the traditional protagonist vs. mentor duel as the final showdown of the series, but Yuma vs. Nasch is the final narrative climax of Zexal, and I think they nailed it.",
                "Yusei v Halldor. Halldor effectively starts the duel with 3 god cards already summoned, but he doesn't just rely on them. Stuff like Gjallarhorn and the Fenrir/Jormungardr combo means that every turn Yusei is cornered in like three different ways. Yusei comes up with stuff like Majestic Star Dragon/Wave Rebound to exploit the gods power, Halldor sees through it, and on it goes.\n\nIt's just such a back and forth chess match between the leaders of the world's two best duel teams.",
                "Probably Yuri vs Asuka/Alexis from Arc V.\n\nMy favorite part about it is that he's using a deck he's unfamiliar with as a handicap, and he actually takes his time to look through the cards and reads the effects as they're written.

That duel was one of the most intense in the entire series. Joey had been slowly getting better throughout all of Battle City and this was the ultimate test of his skill. However nothing could have prepared him for the shadow torture that Yami Marik has planned for this duel. Joey almost managed to win the duel, he was 1 attack away and he even survived a blow from the strongest card in Duel Monsters. Even if he fell in the end, Joey will forever be a hero in our hearts for his courageous attempt to take down the evil Marik and save Mai.",

Like I notice a lot of furries like to call anime fans degens for liking character like uzaki for having big titties but from a \u201cnormie\u201d perspective both sides of it is degenerative. If you find characters like Judy hops hot, guess what your also a degen. I have enough foresight to understand that the baldurs gate scene isn\u2019t the exact as the anime\u2019s that people usually complain about when it comes to fanservice. But it really does feel like a porn addict insulting another addict.\n\n\nIt\u2019s also funny seeing people saying the Baldur\u2019s gate scene is played off for laughs without realizing that\u2019s the exact same excuse anime fans make.

                "Jojo has no canon colors",
                "The manga is black and white. Whenever Araki does a color poster, he colors things however he thinks will look best aesthetically. There are no official colors for anything.",
                "Manga is originally Black and White. The colored manga IS official though. Shueisha rereleased them digitally and colored them. Araki did not do the coloring, so the colors you see in the colored manga are not necessarily canon. He is however allegedly able to give some input on the anime colors.",
                "Those colorized panels were done by Shueisha for the digital release of the manga on mobile for Japan. Select few beginning pages and one shot releases (like Rohan at the Louvre and both fly high with Gucci one shots) were colored by Araki with no application to the anime",
                "There wasn't a canon color in the first place. Ezcept for stuff like Jotaro's Eyes or Giorno's hair, Araki didn't set a color palete in stone. One day he draws Jolyne with Blue hair and the next day he gives her Red Hair and the next one Green hair. He doesn't care at all.",
                "as people have pointed out there are no \"canon\" colors, david productions ususally looks for pretty unanimously accepted color schemes in merch and video games ect. and will usually do some sort of hodgepodge. though with some baffling decisions thrown into the mix. like giorno for some reason being pink???? and having BLUE ladybugs?????? or how about fugo no longer looking like a strawberryy:(((((((((",
                "1 - they don't always\n\n2 - the manga colours aren't canon, Araki hardly ever specifies colours\n\n3 - sometimes it's just because it's more aesthetically pleasing that way",
                "They probably changed Giorno because Part 4 had a lot of characters in blue/purple \n\nShigeki is probably for unique-ness as Okuyasu and Josuke are both wearing purple-ish outfits \n\nAnd I assume The World\u2019s change was just to look nicer",
                "The coloring job was not done by araki it was done by shonen jump and most of the coloring came after the anime was released.\n\nThe colors are different also becouse the anime wanted to do things in there own way as they felt it would work for the series over all look.",
                "The Official Manga colors don\u2019t have any influence from Araki. The Anime Does. And due to any colored jojo drawings being different almost every time, the people who colored the manga pretty much had to guess",
                "The manga colours were entirely made up by shueisha based on the few coloured covers and other coloured pages made by Araki, whilst the anime colours were all done with reference to said art and also some of Araki's own guidance.",
                "Correct me if I\u2019m wrong but most colored manga is not officially done with few exceptions of like certain art pieces and official book artwork",
                "For me the real colors are the anime colors, because Araki has influence in them",
                "I mean, besides there being no canon colors, the ones from the anime generally look way better anyway. Look at Giorno's anime colors, for example.",
                "I think for Giorno it's for color veriety. Since there was too much blue in Bruno's gang",
                "Colors are not canon.",
                "Sometimes it looks better\n\n*Sometimes*\n\nI vibe with pink Giorno and yellow-green The World a lot",
                "Coz the original manga is b&w",
                "1. JoJo has no canon colors, besides few instances when a character NEEDS to be blonde (Dio, Giorno and etc.)\n2. Shueisha COlored Manga does not consult Araki in terms of color palettes for characters. Their main goal is to make manga readable on mobiles and they do no care if the character colors look bad, way too saturated or unnatural. Meanwhile DP does consult Araki (at least in Parts 1-5) and you can tell that Anime palettes are semi-canon.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn short - Colored Manga is NOT the definite palette source for any of the colors for characters. Especially when it makes way too many mistakes, miscolors and simply ugly colors in general. But so as Anime. If someone doesn't like green-orange FUgo - they have a right to not accept that palette. If someone doesn't like Part 2 Joseph colors, but likes his Opening colors - they have right to say that these Joseph's colors fit more. And etc. Again, JoJo has no canon color palettes.",
                "The manga colors are technically unofficial, because they were arbitrarily decided by shueisha and not Araki himself. The manga has no official colors beyond things that are obvious or directly stated by other characters (e.g. Dio being blonde, heirophant green, hermit purple).",
                "I like the colored manga The World so much hope they do that version for Steel Ball Run",

                "Colors even change in the same episode/page. Jojo's is known to experience different color palette for each character",
                "Because its bizzare",
                "The World actually changes in the final Part 6 op, so even the anime isn\u2019t consistent",
                "The colored manga is made by the publisher of JoJo. So they decide the colors on their own and Araki has no part in it. The same thing can be said with the anime, but Araki has stated that he agrees with the anime when it comes to colors.",
                "I think is mostly style",
                "99% of the manga colors are not filled in by Araki. Technically, the anime has more accurate colors due to Araki overseeing the animation and subsequently the color palettes for the characters in the show",
                "1, to stand apart from josuke\n2, to indicate he is a middle school student and not in highschool. \n3 for depth and contrast",
                "Shueisha (the publishing company for jojo's) usually colours their best selling series for a digital release, they did so for One Piece, Demon Slayer, Hunterxhunter and Jojo's.\n\nThese colours are based on the respective author's colored pages, that happen very rarely, on top of that Araki swotches palettes so often that even the same chapter with 2 colored pages will have 2 different palettes, making the work extremely hard on shueisha.\n\nThey ended up choosing arbitrary colours for the characters that have no official ones (like Dio's blond hair, Kakyoin's Emeral GREEN, Polnareff's silver hair and Diavolo's King CRIMSON) most of the colours that you see are based on the most frequent ones in the covers, so every uniform in DiU is purple and Giorno is made to be with a dark suit as his suit is dark also in b&w.\n\nThe anime follows partly the cover colours for the show, but also Araki's own suggestions, and the result of one of these suggestions was Giorno's pink suit.\n\nThe manga digital colours and the anime ones are mostly indipendent, althought in part 6 they ended up using the same exact palette except for Jolyne and Pucci.",
                "Those two the worlds are different",
                "The anime colors are more \"canon\" as theyre chosen by araki, he has no inup in the colored manga",
                "The mangas aren't coloured? They are fan made.",
                "Those are fanmade color adaptations. Araki has some color stuff in his manga but it\u2019s rare and often a faded orange red to the characters.",

                "The color in the anime change constantly",
                "They change the clothing colors because some colors are easier to animate than others. Like if a character has black hair they might change it to navy blue or a similar color because it is insanely hard to animate with black",
                "both the animation and coloured manga uses the same way of picking colours which is Araki helps them a little bit and the rest they get to decide for themselves",
                "Well the manga is in B&W\n\nColors are not \"official\" except the anime ones",

                "Manga has no official colors",
                "Why not",
                "Like pretty much all manga it is done in black and white then colored by other companies. And Jojo doesn't really have a defined colors scheme due to Araki coloring the covers and promotional art work whatever colors he wants. So it creates a situation where the color scheme of a character depends on what they are in, Fugo was Red and White in the manga, yellow and white in the PS2 game, the original ASB had predicted his anime colors, then EOH made him yellow, and finally we got his anime colors.\n\nUntil the anime comes out there can often be multiple colors for a character as the anime solidifies their color scheme.",
                "Bro the colors change between volume to volume in the mamga",
                "Araki plays with colors too much for there to be \u201ccanon\u201d colors. Stands or outfits will change color depending on the tone of the situation.\n\nThere are a couple exception to this like DIO\u2019s hair pretty much always being blonde but even then I think his hair has changed colors once or twice.",
                "The manga is black and white and written by Araki himself, the colored manga is made by VIZ who make their own color pallet. The anime also has it's own pallet. Technically Jojo has little official color pallet, we know for a fact that DIO and Giorno have blonde hair and Hierophant Green is green obviously, so unless it's stated it's likely not canon",
                "Bc they can",
                "Giorno looks way cooler in the manga.",
                "The character colors change like every panel in the manga and every 2 seconds in the anime. In jojo, colors are optional.",
                "Fugo got the biggest change.",
                "Why not?",
                "The one from the colored manga weren't chose by Araki, they were made by Shueisha, in the anime David Production asked Araki what color schemes to use for the characters and follows what he says, thus making the anime colors the canon ones",
                "Why do colors change between the anime and the anime, jojo has not cannon colors. You even see different color schemes in the color spreads that Araki makes.",
                "Cause they Change all the Time.",
                "In terms of coloring, the anime probably has the closest thing to canon colors over the colored manga.",
                "Shueisha Co. does the colored manga, with no input from Araki. It\u2019s entirely third party.\n\nThe anime colors, however, are due in large part to Araki\u2019s input and guidance.",
                "It\u2019s probably cause certain colours of ink are expensive and honestly I think the colour schemes in the anime are better anyway",
                "Araki needed it to be more gay",
                "Theres no \"real\" reason, they kinda just thought the character would look better this way and they're right most of the time like with jonathan and the world's design\n\nI do wish we had blue giorno tho",
                "wait if there are no official colors does dp choose the colors themselves or they ask araki?",
                "ive had a question since reading SBR. is The World:High Voltage gonna be yellow and grey or are they gonna keep it all yellow? cause full yellow suits Diego better in my opinion and it looks really cool and a bit different from The World.",
                "Becuase the colour use is so fucking schizophrenic in the manga that they just had to grab 1 colour scheme and make a choice.",
                "colors in jojo are not fixed (with exceptions), characters have a certain colouring but in most artworks they are there to represent different kinds of things. also it looks badass if the colors change so often",

With the first arc ending next week expect JJK I still expect JJK to keep this lead until its break though.\n\n**My Happy Marriage** and **Undead Girl Murder Farce** both managed to gain karma for a 3rd time in a row with the former even moving into the top 5.\n\nWeek 4 of Summer is also the week that a certain Winter show at last finishes its first cour with **Nier: Automata**  airing the final 4 episodes and all three eligible ones making the top 15 this week.",

I'm enjoying every single minute of it, all the characters, all the humour, and all the world building. And it looks like it's going to develop a great story really soon as well.\n\nAlso, I hope someone will post the clip of the fight scene from Seven Spellblades. That was legit edge of the seat action and possibly the best thing I've ever seen from J.C.Staff. I know it's a meme, but that episode actually just felt like ten minutes long for me.",

I thought we would get through the (first) manga after 6 episodes, but it looks more like it will be 8.  The original is a light novel.  It had a manga adaptation that stopped abruptly because of mangaka health reasons.  It started up again just last week with a new mangaka (and starting over at chapter 1, even though it's picking up the story where the first manga ended).",

Looks like today's episode will almost do 1k.",

It's nice that [Masterful Cat](https://myanimelist.net/anime/51916/Dekiru_Neko_wa_Kyou_mo_Yuuutsu) is still on there, but that only does so much to dull the pain, especially when it's ranked so low.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have now seen enough of [Helck](https://myanimelist.net/anime/51020/Helck) to confidently say it looks promising. The early episodes revolve around one gag that's flexible enough for wildly different variations and allows a plot to potentially develop and progress. Episode 3 gives us a lot of world building and progresses the plot while maintaining enough of its humour to keep the exposition from getting boring. It looks like the series can handle telling a story and won't be carried entirely by the charm of the protagonist's carefree laughter as he does absurd things.",

Here\u2019s to the second half having a reasonable production schedule. Yay for using the puppets in the banners. \n\nThe Bleach drop is suprising. Part 1 did numbers throughout and the Separation is a banger for fights. Especially the episode here being one of the most anticipated additions to TYBW. \n\nHappy Marriage and Undead Girl doing soild though! Former had buzz coming in, but has been a really good drama so far. Undead Girl is still my surprise of the season. Agatha Christie murder mysteries meets literary monsters and the Monogatari series?

                "I know that the combination of multimedia franchise, confusion over whether you need to watch other seasons (you don't), 3D, and being close enough to an idol show that people may still avoid it (despite not being one) ensures that **BanG Dream: It's MyGO** is doomed not to make it to these, but I feel like I have to at least give it shoutout for the music and \"girls do thing\" fans. \n\n\"[Gremlin girl](https://imgur.com/a/R4aB7Tl) with her own baggage unwittingly signs up for picking up the pieces of a band that already crashed and burned\" is a great premise, and I've been very impressed how it's handled it and its characters, especially the two leads. Written by the script writer behind Flip Flappers's first half, I recently found out, which may be a sell for those of you who were in the discourse trenches about that writer change back in the day. It has a good shot to be my AOTY so far, and I say this as someone with zero prior experience with the franchise.\n\n**Synduality Noir** is also another pleasant surprise outside of the ranking, though not on the same level. Very good looking for a mech game tie-in, and consistently fun despite not showing anything especially unique yet.

Both were shows I had planned on skipping but they turned out much better than expected. Sevenblades had an incredible, well-animated fight this most recent episode that should give it a bit of a bump, although the gap between 7/8 is too high. \n\nNot super stoked for anything else in the top 15 though (NieR being a one-time thing).

Anyway, as an MT fan, I don't put much stock in karma ranking.   Instead, I look at the number of comments since there are so many brigades of down votes that either don't watch the episode or hate watch.  The pattern is funny.  For about the first 700-1000 comments you'll get the fans with mostly praise and then the brigades set in with their \"dry, rinse, and repeat\" criticisms.  You'll tell if it is a good episode mostly by how much the bad comments stick out, not whether they exist.\n\nFrom what I gather, there are probably three groups that down vote on a consistent basis.  First are the Re:Zero fans.  I don't get this group.  They actually need to get a life.  I'm a fan of both series but these fanatics seem to believe that they have some grievance due to White Fox or something.  Re:Zero is getting a third season so chill. \n\nNext are the \"anti-pedo, hate Rudeus\" group.  These individuals, in general, can't get the difference between a good person and a good character.  I blame the way literature has been taught and movies have evolved for this largely.  I mean Hamlet wasn't exactly a good person but was a great character.  Fight Club is my favorite movie of all time and Joker was a masterpiece but both characters are dark to say the least.  This group scares me the most because they are outright pro-censorship, albeit via social media.  They will be the ones that destroy  anime.\n\nFinally, are the \"any isekai is bad\" group.  They may  be tourists from 4chan.  They are mostly harmless as they are just expressing a dislike for the genre.",

The reason so many people hate them is that many of them are pretty formulaic, low-effort and riddled with clich\u00e9s.  However, to be fair this same criticism can be levied at pretty much any established genre.  When something gets successful (as isekai has) it tends to spawn plenty of low-effort imitators who are really just interested in cashing in on the latest fad rather than telling a compelling story.  This is more of an industry problem than an isekai-specific problem tho.",

                "Isekai is a subgenre where the protagonist is transported or reincarnated to a different world, often a fantasy realm, parallel universe, or a video game-like setting. In these new worlds, the protagonist usually possesses special abilities, knowledge, or skills that make them stand out and lead to exciting adventures.  \n\n\nRe:Zero, Konosuba, Mushoku Tensei & That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime are some Isekai that I recommend watching.",
                "Isekai would literally translate as \"other world\". It's the Japanese equivalent of \"Portal Fantasy\" in western fantasy circles (note: Portal Fantasy doesn't require actual portals).\n\nYou'll get a fair variety of opinions on best. I'd probably throw in *Ascendance of a Bookworm* among the modern Narou-kei (more on that in a moment) isekai, and probably something like *Magic Knight Rayearth* among the older guard.\n\nMany people aren't a fan of isekai, and a lot of that stems from the current state. Narou-kei is used to refer to a branch of isekai that has become the dominant form in the modern anime industry, and these originate from web novels that began on a site called Narou. As they're amateur web novels, they tend to basically just yoink whatever is currently popular with a minor spin on it. They tend to be extremely derivative, and have a heavy dose of wish fulfillment.",
                "Isekai, from I-sekai (sekai=world), is a something between a trope and a genre where the main protagonist is transported from a world to another. \n\nWhy people hate them? Well, while there are some worthy titles (Re:Zero, Log Horizon, Konosuba, Eminence in Shadow, all worthy for different reasons), 75-95% of the time they follow the same procedure: \n\nStep 1: A dude is an idiot and a social pariah, an utter loser in life. \n\nStep 2: He gets transported into another world. More often than not, via Truck -kun LTD. \n\nStep 3: Take a shitty look at a generic RPG title (D&D, Dragon Age, some JRPGs). Ccopy everything you can without getting a lawsuit and, congratulations, that is your worldbuilding. Bonus shitty points if the protagonist was working or, playing or was reading about whatever shitty RPG they were transported to.\n\n Step 4: Add some girls with big tits, where all the nutrients went to the boobs and the brain was left to starve. Bonus shitty points if a girl is either rescued from a generic useless threat by the isekaied protagonist or if she initially antagonizes said protagonist.\n\n Step 5: The protagonist goes out to have some generic adventures. Because you've copied RPGs, those adventures typically happen in a dungeon. Oh, also fill every bloody organization that should uphold peace and order with utter idiots, that somehow have less brain cells and power than the harem of girls.\n\nStep 6: Main character is handling all the challenges alone. Boob supports with no brain cells ARE REQUIRED to praise and be amazed at every freaking display of power by the MC, even though they've seen the same display of power hundreds of times.  Bonus shitty points if the boob supports with no brain cells try to pick up a sword to fight and fail miserably\n\nStep 7: Boob supports are treated by the MC as equals (even though they evidently aren't) and love interests. He is always kind and nice and generous with them, even though he can casually slash the throat of other girls because they drop loot.\n\nStep 8: If you feel spicy enough, the boob supports are going to have some NSFW moments, usually at a hot spring bath. \n\nStep 9: When everything is set and done, make sure you have the most generic art style and the most mediocre animation you will ever find in anime.   \n\n\nBonus shitty points if the shows crosses genre with another well hated trope/genre: OP main character that goes to a magic academy. \n\nBonus shitty points: Make some stupidly long and complex title. \n\nHere you have it. The basic 9 commandments that 75% of the isekai follow religiously (Those shows are so shitty, you cannot even reach 10 commandments. Trust me I've tried to reach 10). 95% of the Isekai also follow part of those principles, or at least the shitty points, but the difference is made by having more braincells than you would expect and somehow excel in some positive aspects, making them worthy of watching.\n\nNow, why I've listed the commandments and how are they related to the hate? Well, as the name suggests, they are commandments, rules. This means everything has the same core shit in them. AND THERE ARE SO MANY OF THEM.  Furthermore, if you remove Steps 1-3, you get into even shittier meta-trope: The OP main character shitting on everyone.  Which means even more shit. There are like 2 Isekai OP main characters and there are like 5 OP MC shows EVERY GOD DAMN SEASON. They exist for nothing, but to fill up unused time slots in anime channels. That's what they are. Cannon fodder, that were never supposed to have any value, wahtsoever.",

I'd encourage you to watch it yourself to see if that's something you want to deal with.

Well frankly theres a ton of them being adapted, and since their written by mostly amateurs published on [Naro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sh%C5%8Dsetsuka_ni_Nar%C5%8D), so the quality of writing is often lackluster. They also tend to be very similar to each other, since most of them are highly influenced by [Dragon Quest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Quest), which is for the most part, responsible for any video game tropes (skill leveling, status screen, etc) in these anime. Nonetheless, isekai is a very popular genre and it's sort of in a similar place to superhero movies in the west imo, where after you've seen a few of them, you likely won't encounter much off the beaten path, but make a ton of money.\n\nAs for the best isekai's, it's of course subjective, many here are a few that are often in the conversation.\n\n* [Re:Zero](https://myanimelist.net/anime/31240/Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu)\n* [Mushoku Tensei](https://myanimelist.net/anime/39535/Mushoku_Tensei__Isekai_Ittara_Honki_Dasu)\n* [KonoSuba](https://myanimelist.net/anime/30831/Kono_Subarashii_Sekai_ni_Shukufuku_wo)\n* [That Time I got Reincarnated as a Slime](https://myanimelist.net/anime/37430/Tensei_shitara_Slime_Datta_Ken)\n\nThere are of course more great isekai, which you can look through [here](https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/62/Isekai)",

Said worlds are often medieval worlds or game worlds, allowing the creators to be lazy with worldbuilding. Also, a lot of the time, the reincarnation/transportation is just a way to have a main character who is unfamiliar with the world and needs to have everything explained to them, and is rarely relevant outside of that, to the point where many isekai could be just regular fantasy.\n\nMy favorite isekai:\n- Ascendance of a Bookworm (the best imo; I have all of the LNs that have been released physically in English)\n\n- Reincarnated as a Sword\n\n- My Next Life as a Villainess\n\n- MagiRevo",

It is so prevalent that it\u2019s become it\u2019s own subgenre. I\u2019ll be frank about how I feel about it. To call them derivative and formulaic would be a gross understatement. Most of them are basically interchangeable with others. That\u2019s not the worst of it. Their biggest problem is that almost all isekai are garbage in and of themselves. Even the ones that break away a bit from the strict formulas are usually not great for other reasons, like incompetent writing and execution. Light novels are generally mass-produced, McDonalds tier pieces of media (with few exceptions), and many of the problems prevalent in isekai were prevalent in light novels before isekai was as big (generic escapist power fantasies with self-insert, no-personality main character and a bunch of one-note girls who love him by virtue of being in the same show, though that barely scratches the surface).\n\nNow, as for good ones, there actually are some. I would personally say there are less than five that could be considered worth your time out of the hundreds that have been adapted into anime. Foremost among them would be Konosuba. Despite what some other people will tell you, you don\u2019t actually need to be experienced with isekai to enjoy it. Other than that, I would advise you avoid anime that are tagged isekai like the plague. Most people who watch isekai seem to do so simply because they\u2019re there, not because the shows themselves have any sort of merit.",
                "There are many good ones but they get hidden or drowned out by all the generic shit thats out there.\n\nLike it is a good genre and allows for so much world building but what irritates viewers is that it always follows the same pattern in 90% of the ones I have seen, so much so that the entire plot is given in the title.\n\nMC Dies \"tragically\" after hating his life, usually by Truck-kun->God or some deity takes pity and reincarnates MC usually with a choice of what to have in the next world->goes to fantasy setting usually with rules and mechanics from video games and is born usually into noble family and has all their experiences and skills as well as completely busted snowballing abilities->character gets so overpowered in the first episode that we can usually predict they curbstomp any enemies they encounter, always get the girl and become the super hero, nothing else happens to make it interesting or unpredictable and what irritates me is how nonchalant the character always just accepts what just happened. The concept of isekai is so fucking common that even the characters in the show know exactly when it happens.\n\nNow for some of my suggestions\n\nJobless Reincarnation is pretty good imo as it does not follow such a generic and conventional plot and the characters are not so shallow. \n\nYoujo Senki or Saga of Tanya the Evil is also brilliant. Alternate World War setting and the main Character keeps trying to prove to God how atheist he is no matter what he is forced to do.\n\nUnpopular opinion but Re-Do of Healer has actually got a good premise and some unique takes on what healing can be, if only it was not such a vile hentai/rape induced revenge story it might have had a better impression.\n\nOverlord is cool because we are seeing the worldbuilding aspect and even though we know the MC is the goat, the show is how he builds an empire and we see what steps he takes to cautiously keep everything under control.\n\nHope that explains some stuff",

These never follow any logic or sense and the story always progresses how the author feels like.\n\nAnd on top of that, the protagonist is mostly a total dumbass but nothing bad ever happens to him because, you know, main character.",

Sometimes he might even be killed by thunder, a knife or by a plane crash. But generally it's a good ol' truck. It's been done so much that Trucks in those animes are lovingly called truck Kun.\nMany people hate them because they ALWAYS follow the same formula.\nie: a socially inept male that gets bullied or called a loser by his peers live into depression until bam truck Kun swipes him and he find himself thrown into another world. Upon his rebirth, he gets some broken powers for no reason and he attracts all the hot girls despite having no personality or interesting goals.\nHe then proceeds to beat enemies in a generic fashion until the end of the series.\nPeople hate blank characters and the generic formula that almost all Isekai follows.\nThe Isekai genre rarely takes risks to innovate and since some people watched many of them, it becomes tiresome after a while.\nNow the best series among these just use the tropes very well and to some point, have some decent or good level of writing.\nIt mostly depends on your tastes but I can recommend 'Mushoku tensei' and even though you might drop the series because the MC is a creep, it has some good writing along with some breathtaking animation.\nYou can also try tensei Shitara slime datta ken, Arifureta(Can't remember the full name because most Isekai tend to be full sentences for some reason), The world's best assassin gets reincarnated in another world as an aristocrat( yes that's the full name), Tate yuusha no nariagare, Overlord, Log horizon, the latest seasons of Sword art online can count as Isekai but people hate the series because of the MC.

I'd love to give it to Mushoku Tensei but the degenerate aspects of it make it hard to recommend to everyone. Konosuba is the best for comedy.\n\nPeople hate them because they are lying to themselves. In all seriousness though, people have soured on the genre because there are so many of them. There are like 4 isekai this season, one of which has the main character turned into a sentient vending machine in a fantasy world.

                "In general, isekai is a genre with several sub genres that basically sees the protagonist be transported from the world they know to a new one. This can be through death and reincarnation, time travel, digitization or a slew of other means. The new world can be either known or unknown to the protagonist and is largely wide open in terms of setting so long as it is markedly different from their previous one. \n\nPeople don\u2019t hate them per say, but they do get made fun of a lot because over the past 7ish years there had been a none stop flow of generic cookie-cutter basic bitch shows within the genre that follows the formula to a fault.\n\nAnime is scheduled by season, and every season there are 2-4 isekai that are so generic you could easily swap entire scenes from one into another and if you aren\u2019t paying attention it would be hard to know. Search Isekai town in Google and you will get dozens of images of the same town from several different shows. Or how many of the protagonists look VERY similar. On top of that there is the issue of many characters being one dimensional and completely held up by tropes.\n\nI could go on, but the basic gist is that the genre suffers from being over saturated with low effort garbage.\n\nThat being said, not all isekai is bad and there are some really good ones out there. Probably the top 5 in terms of most beloved are:\n\nMushoku Tensei\n\nAscendance of a Bookworm\n\nOverlord \n\nKonosuba\n\nRe:Zero\n\nThere are some older ones like Digimon and Inuyasha, but they reflect a different iteration of isekai - before the term was commonly used. They are about people being transported to a different world and their journey to get back. Modern isekai is less about the journey to return home and more about the person adjusting to the new world and finding their place within it. It\u2019s basically a do-over, a chance to try life again with the knowledge of your past life in order to avoid previous pitfalls and live a better life. A lot of modern isekai are also influenced by video games and MMORPGs in particular. The generic trash in particular tends to basically have the premise of \u201cWhat if you died and came back to life inside a video game but you had cheats on\u201d. They also tend to have really long titles explaining the premise as well.",

Plus the relationship between the MC and the love interest takes logical and real steps in growth that doesn't feel pushed or random.\n\nAnother good watch is my hero academia (avoid the fan base though). The first 2 seasons can be a struggle though because the MC cries alot in those seasons (but I would be too if I was their age doing what he's doing). The last 8 episodes of season 6 were PLUS ULTRA.\n\nBlack Clover is a good one. (Not an isekai) It's about a boy who doesn't have any magic in a magic riddled world, and his foster brother and best friend is a prodigy. The MC is not powerless though, as he has a trick that seems to be just perfect for the world he lives in.\n\nA fantastic Isekai is The rising of the shield hero. 4 Cardinal heroes are summoned to another world to defend it from the onslaught of the coming waves of monsters. Though summoned as a hero, the shield hero can't seem to catch a break, and must face a myriad of trials, that no hero should have to face. He will overcome them. He is a hero after all, I dare say. \n\nAnother isekai, known as The Eminence in Shadow, is a story of a boy who reincarnates, because he refuses to be killed by anything. You get to see the creation and operation of a clandestine group of assassins known as Shadow Garden, and watch everything fall into place just as the MC likes it.

I've been really digging The Ancient Magus Bride. Fruits Basket 2019 is one of my absolute favorites.

Usually they're transported from our world to the other one, but in a reverse Isekai, the formula is, well, reversed: The main character is originally from another world, and ends up on Earth somehow. \n\nThe benefit of doing this is that now the writers have a character who has no idea how the new world works, which allows them to justify explaining their magic system and everything. \n\nSome of the best Isekai, in my opinion, are: \n\n* Reincarnated as a Sword. \n* Log Horizon. \n\nAlso, some reverse Isekai: \n\n* The Devil is a Part-Timer. \n* Hirogaru Sky! Precure. \n* Edomae Elf. \n\nIn some Isekai, the character isn't confined to the new world, and can more or less freely travel between their original world, and the world where the story takes place. \n\nNow, as for why so many people seem to hate them, that's easy: The genre has devolved into a fixed list of tropes that more or less play out the same, with very little variety. There are some Isekai that make those tropes work, or add some spice to the formula, which you'll likely find as recommendations. \n\nReverse Isekai are also quite fun, since they insert a character, who usually possesses supernatural abilities, into a normal human society. \n\nThere is also the sub-genre, or sub-sub-genre depending on whether you see Isekai as its own genre or not, where the main character isn't transported into another world, but simply into another time. \n\nFor more information, watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MedjuejIJ14).",

[Here's a TVTropes entry on it](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrappedInAnotherWorld)   \n  \n> Why do so many people hate them?    \n    \nIn modern times, a lot of isekai are seen as extremely formulaic or incestuous in terms quality, ie, most isekai's tropes can be seen as basically having the same ones.  Many isekai are power fantasies as well, stories where the main character gets all kinds of super cheating powers, a harem of girls who slobber over the main character and is seen as able to do anything in this fantasy world.  This is because the *vast* majority of isekai are from or inspired by Japanese web novels which is basically fanfiction posted online and the meta of those is to have these overdone tropes.  That's not to say the occasional isekai can't break out and be something new.  In fact the ones that don't do this are usually though of as pretty good. But why it is so hated is because most of them are not something new.  It's the same thing again.  It also doesn't help that I think people in the community are fully aware that \"it's trash but I like it\".  \n  \nHowever, one thing people don't usually add to this conversation is that isekei as a genre of anime has always been around for a very long time.  Since the 80s at minimum.  A *lot* of older isekai are quite good and may not fall into the pratfalls that the isekai that are based on light novels in the modern age fall into.  However since pretty much most of those are before 2012, they don't get brought up as much and isekai gets thought of as a trash genre with a couple standouts.  The large difference is how much of a power fantasy the genre has become after its explosion in the light novel department compared to the past\n  \n> What are the best Isekai?\n  \n-**[Digimon Adventure](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/153xeop/digimon_adventure_1999_is_arguably_the_best/)**  \n-Fushigi Yuugi  \n-Inuyasha (more of an acquired taste on this one)  \n-M\u00c4R  \n-Magic Knight Rayearth  \n-Kiba  \n-KonoSuba  \n-Escaflowne  \n-El Hazard  \n-Log Horizon  \n-Re:Zero (I'm more mixed on this series than other people but it is very popular)  \n-Grimgar  \n-Welcome to Demon School!

                "Isekai is the Japanese term for ''Portal Fantasy'', think Alice in Wonderland. A common variety is reincarnation where the MC (or a group of people) died and is reborn (either as a baby or in adult form) in a new world, but not all reincarnation stories are isekais since they can be reborn in the same world (example: Reborn to Master the Blade takes place in the same world). It is also generally easier to write in the beginning of a story because you can skip writing a complicated introduction to the world because the MC is as fresh to the world as the reader is. \n\nIt is a huge sub genre that has been around for a real long time, it was the biggest trend during the 10s but it is faltering nowadays. Still going to be prelevant just not to the same degree. Also anime is basically 3+ years behind on trends in light novels and manga. The current trending thing is villainess stories and things related to betrayals, they might be isekai stories but they aren't always like that. \n\nThe reason why a lot of people hate them is because they view them as generic and one note stories. And while there is a lot of similar stuff there is also quite a bit of variety, just people chose to focus on the generic stuff. A lot of the time they call generic fantasy shows for isekai shows even if they aren't actually even isekais.\n\n-----------------------\n\nRecommendations with a focus on variety:\n\n* Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash \n\nIt is a pretty serious show where lethality and trauma is pretty realistic. It is a slow paced show. The MC is a dude with a main party of 6. All of them are isekai'd. Some romance happens.\n\n* Problem Children Are Coming from Another World, Aren't They?\n\nMore light hearted, the story is about 3 teenagers (1 dude, 2 gals) from 3 different eras (past, present and future) who gets invited into this massive world that is controlled by games. Most games are pretty action oriented. No romance happens. \n\n* Executioner and Her Way of Life\n\nInstead of the MC being isekai'd she is an assassin who kills people who come to the world before they can mess it up. The story is about a target she can't kill with her own powers. Very action heavy, good fights, interesting world and some romantic undertones but it is very secondary to the action, plot and world building of the story. \n\n* Reincarnated as a Sword\n\nTwo MCs, one is the Japanese dude who dies and is then reincarnated into that world, the other is a native catgirl he kinda adopts. Good father - daughter  relationship. Very action heavy, great OSTs and Fran is quite battle hungry. No romance. \n\n* Konosuba\n\nIt is a parody of RPGs and isekai stories. While I would recommend watching after some other isekai stories most of the parody is applicable if you have played some party based RPGs also. MC is a dude who died in a hilarious way, gets to pick a cheat ability and then selects the goddess in charge of it instead of an ability for plot reasons. Main group those two + 2 others. They are all flawed individuals with not the best morals but they aren't bad people either. Large comedic focus. \n\n* The Magical Revolution of the Reincarnated Princess and the Genius Young Lady \n\nTwo girls being the MCs. One who loves magic more than anything but can't use it and the other who is blessed with smarts and talents in magic and most other areas. Romance, politics and world building is the main 3 with some action popping up now and then. Very gay. \n\n*  Gabriel DropOut\n\nIt is an reverse isekai, which means that it is someone who comes from another world to ours. It is a comedic slice of life story about a serious angel coming to earth to live as a student for a bit to learn about humanity and gets addicted to gaming and other fun media she isn't used to see in heaven.",

If I feel like it maybe I\u2019ll do a follow up about Spicy Isekai.\n\nVANILLA: Vanilla isekai is the plain, unblemished, and original form of isekai. It\u2019s the bread and butter of wish fulfillment, and the basic story plot is easy to use and adapt, making it a favorite to mass-produce by companies. The plot usually goes something like this:\n\n1. Hero is summoned to another world from regular normal cookie cutter life, and is prophesied to save the kingdom from the BBEG.\n\n2. Hero gathers party and adventures doing regular adventure stuff, possibly gathering a harem.\n\n3. Hero + party confronts BBEG and defeats him, all with the power of love and friendship.\n\n4. Hero either goes back to his world or stays in the new world. \n\nAs you can see, this plot structure is easy to change and modify. However, most of the time, the storylines are permanently locked onto step two, because if the story ends people can\u2019t monetize it after all. These types of stories are extremely popular as mangas, manhwas, LNs, those sort of things, except for anime. Anime usually has different types of isekai. This is where we introduce the sub-class of vanilla isekai which I can\u2019t be bothered to name.\n\nThese types of plot structure made for anime are built like this:\n\n1. Protagonist is summoned to world.\n\n2. Protagonist must complete a [Goal], usually a huge task, like revitalizing a ruined kingdom.\n\n3. Plot shenanigans occur.\n\n4. Protagonist overcomes said [Goal] \n\nNow rinse and repeat 2-4 and now you have a working anime isekai plot.",

It also builds him back up again, and show us a story of the main character Subaru bettering himself as a person.\n\n\nI know that\u2019s all kinda vague, but I can get more in-depth if you want me to.",

Qa5. Do you prefer this move over Qd8? Why?.\n\n   - Also and on move 23 after white played c4 you replied with 23... c5. Before you made your move, how did you feel about your position? Were you comfortable in it and could you have pushed for a win?\n\n  - Lastly, in this line in the Petrov where white played 12. Bg5 (same as the one in your game) which I believe is white most agressive move, the position that arises, do you think it's ideal for black to play for a win? Or is he just playing to equalize and settle for a draw?\n\n3\u2022 What would you recommend a chess player to do to help with his visualization skills in calculating variations?\n\nHope you have a great day and good luck at the FIDE World Cup \ud83d\ude09",

Do you think that chess is - at least for non professional players that still play a lot - a waste of time?\n\n-----\n\nContext for the two question.\n\n**For the no1**. a lot of people think that people that perform well at chess can automatically be very good in other fields (I am skeptical on it as there are too few cases to support this). And for good I mean: being top 0.1% at chess translates in being top 0.1% (or close to it) in another intellectual activity.\n\n**For the no2**.\n\nIt sounds not so serious but it is quite a topic that get discussed often in communities.\n\nThere are plenty of people that quote Morphy saying _\"The ability to play chess is the sign of a gentleman. The ability to play chess well is the sign of a wasted life.\"_\n\nThe quote is often reported without context. At the time chess was seen as a \"bad activity\" as it was linked to gambling and hustling. As if all chess players would play only for money and bets.\n\nStill, even knowing the context, many thinks about chess as a sterile activity, especially for non-titled players. Even for titled players they think they waste their brain on a board game rather than on something more impactful (the definition of impactful is never provided though).\n\nHow do you see this point?",

It isn't going to appeal to everyone, but if you're looking for adults just going about their lives, look no further.\n\nWith a splash of adventure thrown in, you might end up at {Uchuu Kyoudai} - Space Brothers. The little brother actually follows through on the pair's childhood dreams of being astronauts, and the story follows the big brother as he goes through the process of trying to join the program himself during an early midlife crisis. (Also, its really long, so there's a lot of content there for you. I particularly liked it as space nerd with a physics degree.)\n\nSeveral others have been suggested here that I support. {Odd Taxi} was great, and is much more than it seems at first blush. {Wave, Listen To Me!} is also great and focuses on radio broadcast - the original JP voice acting is fantastic. If the main VA didn't get some sort of award for it, the industry has failed us.\n\nSomeone mentioned {Planetes} and while its true that its also a scifi - its an adult scifi. The main characters are basically space garbagemen, and the story revolves around a central pair meeting at working. To me, it felt like an adult story for adults, despite being set in space (really almost entirely in Earth orbit, with an arc to the Moon).",

MC realizes his old dream of becoming an astronaut after years in the workforce so it's about him and his journey. His younger brother is already established as an astronaut, so it also shows MC's insecurities about chasing after his younger brother. But his younger brother is so supportive. They both really care for, respect, and want the best for each other. So there's no silly shonen-type rivalry.\n\nAnother rec that I want to mention is the seinen {Ao Aoshi}, but the characters are high school. While they are teenagers, because it is  a seinen it's directed towards adults, it doesn't have the typical high school shonen drama. The growth and issues they growth through develop really well and are relatable even as an adult. Almost like a nostalgic feeling of remembering youthful motivation and passion.",

I just closed the door and sat back on the floor crying. She jumped down, shoved her little self between the space of my knees and chest and kept licking my tears off my face. She would meow, softly paw my face and just keep licking. It made me stop crying lol.

I was nearly 14, Mum and I had gone shopping, there was a pet shop across the road from the shopping centre. We went over to look at the 2 kittens out front. As I leaned down, I got a bit too close to the cage, and this tiny hand, with needle sharp claws shot out and grabbed me. We went in, took him home, he tried to kill me by ripping my throat out, and he became my best mate. He'd sleep under the blankets between my feet when he was cold, he could open the fridge. I miss him every day, which is why he's my phone background.",

                "\nI went to several shelters looking for a cat, at the last shelter I went to for the day, there was what they called the 'Webcam Room' where you could watch the kitties play on their website. There was a small black cat in that room who was calm as could be. I picked her up after giving her some loves and she just let me tote her around. I went to the other rooms with her to see if I may find a companion to take home with her. Every other cat, reacted unhappily to her being there. She however was calm the entire time. I ended up leaving with just her. \nShe was chill enough to be harness trained, I'd sit on the front porch while she relaxed in the grass and even let me tote her around in a backpack sometimes.\nShe's moved states with me since and I've had 2 kids. She's so patient with them, she's very intuitive and seeks out to help when emotional distress is high. She goes practically everywhere with me. \n\nI do have a second one, he showed up on our doorstep about 4 months after our male grey tiger striped boy got out about a year ago. Since he got out I'd been assisting community cats while hoping to find him. I never did see him but I helped a lot of cats. Including a sweet stray that we figured out was pregnant like weeks before she popped em out. I was able to provide her a safe place to have and raise her kittens. I would have TNR'd her but we were moving across town and I couldn't relocate her like that. It was February and we had just had a big snow storm, I'm talking like 2-3ft on the ground. My husband complains from time to time that I have some kind of cat super power because cats gravitate towards me, I just attract them almost everywhere I go if there are cats there. We'd been joking about it and he had just said \"I can't deny if a cat showed up in this weather seeking shelter I wouldn't turn them away.\"\nI had a habit of checking our backdoor ever since incase our ole boy made it home. I looked out the patio door and I'll be damned if there wasn't a black cat sitting at the back door looking at us, surrounded by snow. I just looked at my husband and he goes \"If you're gonna get him, just do it.\" I opened the door and wrapped him in a towel to dry him off. We acclimated him and he never seemed interested in leaving. When we moved we brought him with us and he became a whole new cat when we moved. He follows me *everywhere*. \n\nI feel blessed I have two precious voids to accompany me through this life.\n\nEdit: added pic of the voids in reply",

I think he thinks he's a dog sometimes.\n\nNow, every time I come home, without fail, I am greated by the pat-pat-pat of his little feet running to me and his cute little chirps",
                "We adopted our Siberian cat Boo Boo from the Humane Society back in 2016. I like orange tabbies, and long haired cats, and saw his photo on their website and wanted to see him. \n\nHe was in a cage by himself (had some bathroom problems due to food allergies) and as soon as I picked him up, he snuggled into me. I knew I'd been chosen immediately.\n\nGot him home, he spent some lap time with both me and my girlfriend, and that night he slept on my pillow and wrapped his tail around my neck.\n\nAlmost 7 years later and he's one of the best, sweetest, goofiest cats I've ever met. He had a rough start (we're pretty sure he'd been adopted and returned at least twice, due to the bathroom problems I mentioned which we solved pretty easily by switching his food) and he's been a true joy in both our lives.\n\nCouldn't imagine life without this dude.",

                "Trapped her, her momma and sister and had them spayed.  The kittens were older and right at that point where they could have remained feral.  The rescue that did their spays told us to keep them in the traps for 3 days while they healed.  They were in our basement and we would go down to spend time with them.  I remember I was petting the one kitten when the other kitten, still in her trap, rolled over on her back and gave me the Puss-in-Boots eyes.  That\u2019s when I knew I couldn\u2019t release them outside.  I had a new pet.",

In the evening I let him (and sometimes his \u201csister\u201d who started joining him 4 years ago) out again because I don\u2019t have a litter box.

I went home and asked my girls if they wanted to check out the animals at the shelter, and they jumped at the opportunity to see kitties. When we got there, I watched the cat watch people pass by. Whenever someone stopped to look at him, he would stand up, turn around, and sit facing away from them. When my daughter walked by, he grabbed her by the crook of her arm and pulled her to him. I paid the fees to adopt him, but we had to leave him so the shelter could take him to a veterinarian to update his shots. As my daughter left him, he started yowling and screaming and pawing at the cage door. He was so loud and aggressive that the staff came in to see what was going on. They said he was normally so quiet and calm that they joked he lost his meow. When we picked up our cat from the vet, he hit the kennel door latch with his paw several times and opened it. He leaped into my daughter\u2019s arms and buried his face in her hair like a long lost love. \n\nWe\u2019ve had Loki in our family for near twelve years now.

My older daughter collects tigers. She has a toy life sized tiger head. The first time he saw that head, it was next to my younger daughter. Loki didn\u2019t notice it until he hopped onto my daughter\u2019s lap. He spat and attacked! You can tell Loki was scared witless, but he stood his ground to protect my daughter! He was shaking and looked scared, but he was standing his ground. As far I\u2019m concerned, if he\u2019s willing to protect my daughter with his life, he\u2019s family! It took him over ten years to warm up to me. From the way he acts, we think he was abused by his former owner, and we think his former owner or abuser was a guy. Fortunately, Loki has warmed up to me and will climb onto my lap whenever my daughter isn\u2019t home.",

I found him through his foster home and went to visit him. I saw him grooming and cleaning both his brothers and saw he took on the mama job. It was so sweet. I held him and he was so calm. I adopted him in 2005. He was by my side for 15 years, he was with me when my best friend/soul mate unexpectedly passed away in 2009, he was with me in 2016 when I got in an accident and needed surgery and a long recovery time, he was with me the the best times and the hardest times. It was funny, he never ever made biscuits for me. Maybe it was because he thought he was a mom!\n\nIn his final year he had an emergency and had to get fluid drained from around his lungs and heart. I had to have him on a strict medication schedule 4 times a day, including middle of the night administering. He maintained for a few months but finally ended up getting mouth cancer and he passed about 2 months later in October 2020. Those last months were so hard. But when he left us he was in my husband's arms, right here at home on our bed. He went peacefully and knowing he was being wrapped in love. He didn't understand what was happening but he could feel our love. I miss him so much. I don't want to get another pet for a long time.

So we drove to a house on the other side of town and someone's dad came out of the garage and not long after, a heart-broken looking little girl carrying a gray and white siamese kitten. My instant reaction was, \"NO. I don't want to take a kitten away from a little girl.\" She reluctantly handed me the kitten and as I was holding it in my arms, I was paying attention to the girl's father because he was explaining how they got the kitten and why they couldn't keep him (the mother was their cat and had escaped and got pregnant - all the other kittens had been adopted and he was the last one because he was the runt of the litter). It was right about the moment they mentioned that he was the runt that I felt what I initially thought was him biting my arm. But to my surprise, when I looked down, he was just licking me with his abnormally abrasive sandpaper tongue. That was the moment I knew. I named him Alex.\n\nAlex was my best friend for 18 years.\n\nA few months after he passed, I was at the vet picking up food for my other cats and the doctor was like, \"Hey, I have something I want to show you...\" and she led me back to their isolation room and showed me a little gray and white siamese old man that had been picked up on the side of the highway and his name tag said \"Alex\".

He kept meowing through the glass window at another cat across the hallway, lol.\n\nHe was apparently 5 months old and rescued as a stray and then adopted out, but the family that previously adopted him returned him after a week because he \"had too much energy.\"\n\nI went inside to play with him, and we had a little conversation where I would ask him questions and he would meow back at me as if he was responding.

I thought I was still high. As I\u2019m taking it easy on the highway, the noise intensifies, and it\u2019s a meow.\n\nPulled into work, and my coworkers discovered it was a 10 week kitten who made her way into the hood of my car.\n\nWent to the vet (she actually got loose in the process\u2026.ran down an alley barefoot in a dress to grab her lol). She\u2019s physically unharmed, I get her shots, and I take her home.\n\nA week after, I\u2019m telling my therapist how my apartment is clean, I\u2019ve been doing my best to keep her happy, I\u2019ve been getting up on time, etc. She\u2019s currently confined to a bathroom bc she has Giardia, but I can\u2019t wait until we can explore her new home! \ud83e\udd0d\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8scil6lxoigb1.jpeg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=776912541be20d2d9184517fd51a20401ee19c45\n\n(Taken after her much needed bath\u2026she didn\u2019t mind the water at all!!)",

I later discovered he had been reading my extremely private journals, smelled my shampoo and conditioner, and claimed I was hitting on him (I was 15!!!!) before he decided to do what he did! My room felt tainted. I slept on the couch for weeks and was having nightmares about him.\n\nLater\u2026 I had a friend in high school giving away the kittens his cat had, and my Shai Shai (pronounced shy-shy) was one of the photos. She was the only tux and the only female. But she looked terrified and elusive, so I was unsure. He told me she spent her days sleeping in the hamper of dirty laundry lol. But I showed my mom and she said that would be the one she\u2019s willing to get after I begged her to let me get a kitten because I needed something to change the atmosphere of my room and our apartment.\n\nWe got her and she hid immediately, she was so scared and skittish. She hid under the bed, and me being an unknowing teenager, grabbed her out, which scared her more \ud83d\ude2d so I put her in a little bed I got for her that was like a den and she enjoyed it in there. Then I was laying on my bed and she came up to lay with me out of nowhere. The rest is history. She wouldn\u2019t leave my side \ud83e\udd7a eventually, I curled my arms into a loop and she crawled into the little circle my arms made and laid down. To this day, I can get her to snuggle on command if I curl my arms into a circle \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 she follows me around, purrs the second I\u2019m near her, and is always trying to lay on me (like she is right now lol). I went away on a school trip for a week my junior year of high school and my mom said she screamed at the front door and in my bedroom every single day \ud83d\ude2d\n\nI fell in love with her. She ALWAYS comes to me and demands cuddles any time I\u2019m upset. She\u2019s my comforter and makes me feel so loved when I\u2019m having a hard time. It\u2019s been 8 years with my girl and I love her more and more each day \ud83e\udd79",

Even since 2 months ago we moved into a new house and he's skittish to come downstairs, he'll sit by the top of the stairs and meow at me anxiously until I'm back up. (For the past week, he's gotten courageous enough to stalk me downstairs though.) Whenever I see him, my day gets brighter and I think the same goes for him too.\n\nHe'll sleep on me after making biscuits even though I'm a fussy sleeper. He protects me when I'm pooping or showering - even though he's scared of the water noise and waits outside of the door. Also he has this deep purr that just tickles your heartstrings. \n\nAnd when I'm upset, he'll just come lay down on my chest or back and just snuggle and make me feel safe and loved.

My living situation was very stressful at the time but he quickly picked up on this - any time I felt more stressed or started crying he\u2019d curl up into my lap/chest or start kneading on me. This started just about 2 weeks after I brought him home. We\u2019ve been attached at the hip ever since. I remember my vet saying \u201cThis will be the guy who will stick with you for everything for as long as he lives. He\u2019ll never give up on you.\u201d She was excited for me - I don\u2019t think I fully realized what that kind of unconditional love meant. But over the years I learned it meant he will always be waiting for me by the door, he will always tuck me in at night, he will always snuggle me when I\u2019m down, and he will always follow me wherever I go. We\u2019ve been through many milestones together now and lots of different homes. He is my constant. It\u2019s been over 3 years now and I can\u2019t imagine the last few years without him.",

She showed up and just sat there on the bed in the room he was in. He came up and sat next to her for as long as it took for her to say ok. Now he\u2019s inseparable from her (in a good way) and ends up basically cradled in her arms every night while we watch our shows.

To try and keep them out we tried like 3 different types of baby gate.\n\nThe sister was particularly persistent. The rigid ones she would either jump over or paw at the sides until it fell out of the doorway. The soft one she literally wriggled her way underneath like a snake. Even after we put a block near the bottom. She was SO determined.\n\nUltimately we closed my door but I never wanted to do that because of how dark my room would get, we had a red lamp in the hallway. Something about the light being in the hallway was very comforting to me at the time. I shit you not this cat spent the ENTIRE night (for like 3 nights in a row) pawing at my door and whining outside of it. Keep in mind that if she really wanted to sleep in a bed with people, she could have easily gone down the hallway to sleep in my parent\u2019s room. But no, she wanted to sleep with ME.\n\nUltimately I gave up like \u201cwe\u2019re doing this? yeah, we\u2019re doing this.\u201d She slept in my bed every single night for the next 18.5 years.

When I brought her home, she hid under my couch for the first two days.. then eventually, with lots of pets and treats, she came out from hiding and began hesitantly exploring her surroundings. She jumped up on the couch, walked up to me, and laid in my lap. She was pretty much attached to me all winter. Anyway, I love my baby so much because she is so sweet, and I know she\u2019s been through some trauma, just like me, and it\u2019s my life mission to make her happy, comfortable, and give her a good life.

Now 5 years later she\u2019s really come out of her she\u2019ll and made her place in our family, roaming the house as she pleases. She\u2019s more confident and friendly. But she\u2019s no longer my cat, she\u2019s my sons- they are a bonded pair. Keeping together minding their own business lol",

She lived a rich and full life with me for almost eight and a half years. When she first showed up, she decided to curl up between my feet and sleep while I was on the phone. Pretty soon she became addicted to ham and attention before she finally earned her name. She took out a opossum twice her size over her food dish. I knew that we were soulmates when she disappeared for a few days and I heard her meowing in a garage wall because she decided to explore a bit too much and got locked in. I made my roommate open up the garage and she finally emerged after rattling some treats. She lived outside for almost two and a half years because a cat allergic roommate had the master bedroom. The landlords offered that room to me but knew I would only take it if Cav was put into my lease. We lived there for roughly six years and even did a bit of traveling. We drove from central Texas to central Michigan and back. I miss her everyday, but things are easier with time and my new cat, Noodle. Noodle has become certified as my emotional support animal, which Cav easily could have been if I\u2019d known of the process earlier.",
                "A family member's home backed onto the (family owned) junkyard that had a small colony of feral cats. Like, barely even a real colony, mostly just one Momma Kitty who refused to let herself get caught, but would make sure her kittens got used to the nice human lady who put out food and gave them shelter sometimes.\n\nI visited when one of the litters had kittens old enough to start catching to get fixed and maybe adopted, which was about the age they liked to hang out under my aunt's back deck and investigate people sometimes. I've always really loved cats (we joke it's genetic lol) so I sat on the ground and tried to coax any of them into coming out for some attention and a quick visual checkup. One kitten came out, got some skritches, and went to play with some grass. Then another one came out, very cautiously, and after a long sniff of my hand, came to rub against my leg. When my aunt commented that that was the shyest kitten of the bunch, I realized what a special moment that was and bam, new cat. \n\nWe just passed our 11 year meetaversary and as I type this, he's snuggled up against my thigh like he did when he finally relaxed in the first week he was an indoor kitty. He's all spoiled now, but also still pretty anxious, so he soothes himself by rubbing against everything to scent mark it as \"safe\" \u2013 our furniture, his current favourite box, the wall with the scary noises behind it, and me. When he relaxes around guests, they get some rubs too, but he wouldn't dream of falling asleep touching another cat or human, only me, and I know how lucky I am to have him. \n\ntl;dr: found a kitten under a deck, haven't left the house without my pant legs covered in fur in 11 years.",

So, we\u2019re at the shelter and out of nowhere comes this little orange gentleman brushing onto my leg. I pick him up and I can just put him in my arm on his back. I lean in a bit and he slow blinks and gives me a lick on the nose. I was instantly sold and we came home with 2 cats.

                "My first cat of my own as an adult was Maximus. My husband named him after the gladiator! Lol! I let him name him because he didn\u2019t want a cat, but I had just been diagnosed with MS and he recognized that I needed to have something to focus on besides myself. I found Max on the side of the road. We only had one car back then. I was 25 he was 26. I wasn\u2019t working because I had just found out I have MS, and was on FMLA due to the symptoms. On my way to pick him up from work every night I saw this calico cat walking along the side of the road. She would always move off the road and sit when I passed her, I figured she was a local cat on her nightly prowl. But one night, someone had hit her. I was so sad. I cried forever, and I swore if I saw another cat on the side of the road I\u2019m picking it up and taking it home and I\u2019ll bring it home the next day and tell it\u2019s owner to be more careful with their cat dammit ! \nThe next cat I found was Max. On a dirt road short cut, I used to take through the woods to my husbands work. He had run into the woods when he saw the car. I pulled over and called, here kitty! And he came running to me and I just leaned out and picked him up! The next day I went back and knocked on the door closest to where I picked him up. She told me he had been dropped off with 2 other cats last week. The other two had been adopted by her and a neighbor, but Max was scared of their dogs and wouldn\u2019t come out of the woods. He was afraid of dogs. She said she\u2019d take him if I didn\u2019t want to keep him, but I was already in love. So we kept him. We had him for 11 years. He slept with us every night. He was my best friend. He\u2019s the cat to which all others will always be compared. It\u2019s like he understood us. He used to lay on me while I was reading. While I was in college he\u2019d lay on the desk beside me while I studied. He would go for walks with me in the woods behind our apartment. He was just so cool, he just wanted to be with us, wherever, doing whatever. I miss him so much. He passed away from Kidney failure in January 2012, we discovered he had FIV when he got sick. We have 3 cats now. I love them all too, and they all have their story and their personalities. But none is like Max was. I still miss having my little buddy. He was a people cat. He was my soul mate cat! I remember thinking that one day when we\u2019d had him a few years. My husband thought I was nuts! Lol!",

Spoiler alert: we took them both home. She is truly my little best friend. She is unlike any cat my husband and I have ever met and I would literally die for her. We joke that she knew we were there to see her brother so she schemed her way into our home by going for me AKA the softie.

                "She came into my life when I was already very low in life. I was 12 and my mom was constantly screaming at me every day. Then, one evening, they found her while I was asleep and we took her in. She was physically drained and would've almost died to starvation. In that moment, I knew she needed love. I came home to school to cuddle with her and fall asleep next to her while petting her. On an instant, she became my ray of sunshine. And, atleast for a moment, my mom became nicer to me. She was understanding for about 1-2 months. And when I felt depressed or when it got worse, she visited me in my room to get her 2h-dosis of cuddles. When I wasn't aty mom's, she would wait for me to open my door. And when I came home from school, she would greet me. As corona hit, she would either wake me up with her cranky meow or she would meow at me when I finally made my way to the bathroom, as if she was saying \"Finally, took you long enough!\". And when I now visit my mom's, she even gets up to greet me. She usually doesn't get up for anyone, but she will happily stroll around the cat tree, signaling me to pet her. And when I was at my worst, the night when I almost killed myself due to so much pain, she and my other cat were the ones to get me away from it. They would both lie on my chair (the other) and bed (this kitty) all night long, just to protect me.

                "Well I have three but one is very special.  Right about midnight on my birthday three years ago (December 23, 2020) my husky, who spends almost all his time on the deck in the winter, was staring at something, and I came out and looked down and say a little orange tabby, sitting in three feet of snow.  I ran down and left him some food and cracked my garage door so he could come inside and get a break from the cold (we live in Minnesota).  I did this every night for 5 months.  We tried trapping him, and he was already very well versed in how traps works and he wasn\u2019t falling for it.  I remember just hoping that every morning I would see his little paw prints coming into the garage so I knew he was safe that night.  I would rush home from work every night and grab a can of cat food and call for him and he wasn\u2019t ever very far.  FINALLY, in late April, thanks to a passing doe as a distraction and a drop trap, I finally got him.  To this day, he spends every moment in my presence, thanking me in many ways for not giving up on him.  I can\u2019t even describe the way he looks at me.  It is 100% pure love and gratitude.  He makes me want to be a better person, he makes me want to ignore the things that don\u2019t really matter, he makes me want to keep doing everything I can to help souls in need, he makes me love myself when I can\u2019t find a reason to\u2026he makes me believe in love and kindness when the rest of the world hurts me.

I couldn't - and still can't to this day - believe the coincidence!\n\nBut it wasn't one. She was meant to be our cat and we were meant to be her family. Blessed with 18 years of love... Longer than I've spent on this earth without her. Had to say goodbye in March. Still brings me to tears but so grateful she came into our lives. Miss you every day Summy... see you at the rainbow bridge \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\ude4f\u2764\ufe0f",
                "I was living with an aunt. I was 17. Someone dropped off a little black cat who was pregnant at the farm where we lived. She gave birth to four or five little kittens. One of them just looked shabby, dirty Gray. Everyone called him ugly he was also the runt. My aunt said we had to give them all away I didn't want to give him up my little dust ball. But it wasn't my home. So I gave him away. He went to her son's best friend who wanted to playmate for his Kitty. I was crushed. To one night everyone was out of the house except me. And her son's best friend came to the door not real quick and opened it a crack. He simply said my cat keeps trying to kill it. And he puts a little gray dust bowl back inside the house. I cried I was so happy but I was also sad cuz I knew I had to give him away again. Next day when my aunt came home and saw him she just looked at me and she said he must really be yours you gave him away and he came back. I can't make you give him away again. And that's how I got my Skitzy itzy. I had him for almost 18 years. we were never apart. He grew up into the most incredibly gorgeous smoke colored tabby. I still miss him everyday and I lost him 20 years ago. He was my furry little soulmate.",

I said \u201cSure, you can come up.\u201d He hopped up on my knee and that was it. He was mine. He\u2019d sleep at the shoulder.  When new cats were introduced into the house, he moved to my knees to guard me while I slept. He would rest on my pregnant belly. He would stand on his hind legs asking to be picked up and loved. We\u2019d have meowing conversations. Sometimes he\u2019d cry for me when I was in the shower while he was sitting on the tank of the toilet (right next to the shower).

But he\u2019d always win because he knew how to get to me. \n\nTen years ago, at around 2-3 years old, he got urinary crystals and almost died of a heart attack. \nThe vet wanted to put him down because he hissed at them, is pretty big and scary (for a housecat) when he wants to be, and because treatment would be very expensive. I obviously refused. \n\nI visited him every day. I cried a lot. I realised he was really really important to me. \n\nThe staff said that the only sign of any affection he gave in the two weeks he was there was when I visited. He would purr SO loudly and rub his head against the cage. He just wanted to come home. \n\nWhen I brought him home, he immediately sat on my lap voluntarily for the first time since he was a tiny kitten, purred and fell asleep. \n\nWe both realised that day that we truly needed each other. \n\nHe now sleeps in a raised bed in place of my bedside table, when he\u2019s not curled up on my chest, that is. \nHe yowls when I leave for work and goes mental when I get home.

She had the most human eyes. \n\nWhen I wasn't home, she loved all over my bf. But when we were both home, she treated me like I was her queen and best friend.

We were passing PETCO (about 50 ft away) when I felt this zing through my gut and just faced the doors. I remember distinctly saying, \u201cmy cat is in there.\u201d (There were no cats visible through the doors) We went in, and the local humane society were just packing up an adoption event from that day.

All the cats I met growing up bit, scratched, or hissed at me. I wasn't a cat person.\n\nFast forward my GF and I move in and she brings one cat. She decides he is lonely and wants to foster another cat. I say no because I know fostering = road to adopting. She says fine, let's just adopt one. I bluff and say, \"OK, but we're only getting a cat if I PICK IT!\" expecting her to back down.\n\nShe called my bluff and said, \"OK, go pick a cat.\" \n\nNow in the weeks that follow I'm looking at shelter sites and finally see a cat that has deep orange eyes that I think looks really cool. Guess this is my cat.\n\nI drive there and see him in the cat room napping.\n\nI walk in and he opens his eyes, walks across the room, stretches up his arms to my knees and asks to be picked up. Cuddles happen. This cat is MASSIVE. Not overweight but easily 18 pounds. He is purring his face off and I think I actually found a cat that I like. \n\nAlright, I picked a cat! Go outside to the front desk and say I want to adopt him.\n\n*\"Sorry, someone already adopted him.\"*\n\nDevastation sets in.\n\nI worked myself up to find a cat over weeks, finally found one, and I can't have him. I leave, downtrodden.\n\nGF is sympathetic and knows I'm actually super bummed about not getting the cat. Gives me some space and doesn't push me to pick another. It actually starts to affect me and I get pretty upset over the next few days.\n\nFinally I decide to message the shelter and ask if by any stroke the cat ever comes back then please contact me. They said they would but not to count on it.\n\nA few weeks pass and nothing.\n\nJust as I am about to give up, I get the call:\n\"Hey, so this never happens but the people who adopted him actually *did* bring him back, do you still want him?\"\n\nI was at the shelter within the hour signed paperwork and driving my new little buddy home.\n\nHe's now been my pain in the ass for the last several years.

                "Oh, man, okay. Last year, almost to the day, I was asked to \u201cwalk away, quietly\u201d from the life I had been building for almost the past seven years. I did so under the assumption *and* impression that I would still be able to see my daughter (not biological but that doesn\u2019t matter) and my two cats. They all live in the apartment I got for us and paid for. My ex has made it so we\u2019re no contact. I still can\u2019t believe it sometimes and wonder how someone I thought I knew so well could be so cruel.\n\nAnyways, I end up in a sublet after a month that is an in-law apartment off a main house. A great deal and a nice hidey hole from the world for me to sink fully into the depression that had already enveloped me at that time. One day I get a text from my landlord asking me what my thoughts on cats were. I informed them about my history and how I\u2019ve been pining for my two cats I left behind for my daughter. She proceeds to ask if I would be interested in fostering a female cat for a little while as they re-do their bathroom as she doesn\u2019t like loud noises, voices, and is scared of men in general. Of course, I say heck yes but make sure it\u2019s known that if I can\u2019t have cats wherever I end up after the sublet, Keke will have a safe place to go back to.\n\nShe was so scared and skittish when she came to me. No self confidence and would dart off if I breathed too loudly in her direction. I had to re-learn how to live and act so that I did everything softly to not scare her. As I started the process of moving to a permanent place of living, I hoped it would still be okay for Keke to come with me (new landlord okay\u2019ed, already) and it was. However, we were thwarted by a burst pipe and I had to move into a hotel suite for two weeks. Keke came with.\n\nIn the hotel, her personality really bloomed. Where I thought she\u2019d be scared she gave me even more snuggles and would consistently purr. Fast forward to our new apartment and she has big open windows she sits in and has found a new love of certain treats. She\u2019s started believing in herself enough to ask for pets and she\u2019ll meow for said treats. And as she\u2019s started to heal from whatever trauma she endured before I got her, so have I. \n\nKeke has sat with me through all of my virtual appointments with doctors, therapists, and so many support group meetings. Just her by my side encouraged me to keep going. And when I couldn\u2019t take care of myself I *knew* I still had to take care of her. She gave me a purpose to get up every day. She still does, and she still makes me feel like I\u2019m a really good person who is lucky to have a really, really f*cking good cat.\n\nShe saved my life: yesterday and today.",
                "We had put down a young cat my ex and I adopted a few years ago due to kidney failure and it had been devastating. I would talk long walks to deal with it around our apartment. Surprise to me, an animal shelter was in walking distance. I kept finding myself by there and I took the subconscious hint and went inside. Met a cat a teen who was a disheveled ball of fluff who wanted me to pet him \u2014 but he was still on observation for the next three days. I went home and didn\u2019t think much about my walk till three days later when his observation period ended. I freaked out and started crying\u2014 my bewildered partner asked what is wrong and I said, \u201cwe have to go to the shelter now or someone\u2019s going to take our cat.\u201d He was so happy to see us and we took him home after he was neutered and we was my best friend for 18 years.",
                "This isn\u2019t a specific story but my cat greets me at the door every time i get home, then he runs to the kitchen and leaps on the counter to be at my eye level and head butts me. I have gotten 2 more cats since then, but he is still the only cat who greets me like that. He\u2019s always sitting in the hallway staring at the door when I walk in",
                "I got her when I was born, she used to attack/pounce on me when I was on my play mat which my parents hated. she loved my dad\u2026 My dad passed away when we were 10, she lived until I was 18. \n\nShe was a very sassy cat and I don\u2019t remember much of her in our earlier years, just that I loved her a lot. \n\nI didn\u2019t feed her, my mom did; but during covid every single day she would sit next to me in my bed. Every night she\u2019d sleep next to me, she didn\u2019t like being picked up or cuddled, she\u2019d enjoy pets besides you and I respected that. But the fact she chose me after my dad passed away and would constantly follow me was so amazing. \n\nDuring covid I had to lock her out of my room (because I had rona) and I have a video of me, barely being able to talk with her meowing at me from the other side of the door. About four months later she passed away and I feel so bad I couldn\u2019t give her all of the love that week when I was sick. But I was doing it for her own good because we didn\u2019t know too much about the virus. \n\nShe died in my arms outside of the vet and I GRIEVED, it was so unbelievably painful. I loved her but she also felt like a gift from my dad, so she was also a little piece of him and when she died it became an end of an era for me so much was changing, she was a continuity in my life, an animal who would always be by my side and then she was gone. \n\nHowever, it was the perfect time to say goodbye because I left for college a month later and I honestly do not know what I would\u2019ve done with myself if she died whilst I was away. \n\nI have a ton of scars on my arms from when little me, who clearly wasn\u2019t taught animal boundaries used to pick her up and of course I felt the consequences through scratches. However, I really cherish those scars now as morbid as it is, I have a little piece of her, history, memory etched into my skin.\n\nI always knew she was my soulmate but it really hit when I was around 13-14+ and especially around covid. She could\u2019ve attached herself to anyone in our household yet she chose me and I am so blessed to have been able to care for her and be in her life.",
                "When I adopted her I was immediately drawn to her and for the first few years we had her I was the only one she would let hold and pet her and the only one she would meow at, she\u2019s become more social but I\u2019m still the only one who can hold her and smother her with love. She knows when I\u2019m sad so she\u2019ll come over and flop down on my chest and lay on me till I calm down, if I\u2019m panicking she will come and lay on me and nuzzle my hand to make me pet her instead of pulling at my hair or scratching myself, I can tell when she\u2019s sad or when she\u2019s just not feeling well, I feel more connected to her than I have any other animal, she is my world and I love her so much",

My wife agrees but the cat kept showing up so one day I fed her. Next thing I know, we're going to Walmart to get cat food, a cat bed and etc. Then we see that she's pregnant. Brought her to the vet for confirmation. We brought her home and a few weeks later she had 3 babies that we still have to this day.

We also have a ritual at night, I never go to sleep at the same time but she waits in the other bedroom, and when she hears me lie down, she comes, I pet her, she lie down next to my tights, she grooms herself, don't move for 5-10 minutes then leaves again and then only I sleep.

Went to check them out and there was this one little guy who just really wanted to come out and be my friend. When I took him out he just clung to me and would not let go so I decided I was going to take this guy home but when I talked to the workers apparently I wasn\u2019t supposed to be in that room because those cats were sick and had come from a cat hoarder but when they saw how much he liked me they assured me they would hold him for me till he was ready to be adopted even though holding animals for people was against  policy and a week later I came and got him and he has been glued to me ever since. He turned out to be terrible mouser but an amazing little buddy. We do everything together. He even goes for car rides and goes camping with me. At night he sleeps in my arms like teddy bear. He\u2019s totally obsessed with me for some reason and it\u2019s just me because anyone else is lucky if they even get to pet him",

I tried to take her picture and she smacked my phone from my hand and, not only shattered the screen, but broke it right off. Named herself right there.\n\nWhen I brought her home, my little void spent three weeks grafted to my chest. \n\nA week in, i had a lovely panic attack while she was sleeping in another room. When asked what i needed, I responded \"I need my cat\". I was told to look down and she was right at my hand looking worried. Then, and ever since, she comes to me when i need her.",

When she doesn\u2019t see me through the window and I come in I\u2019ll call out for her and usually hear a loud \u201cbonk\u201d and then a meow, after which she comes running at me. When I\u2019m still in bed after my BF gets up in the morning, she\u2019ll return to the bed after eating breakfast and will wait on my legs until I get up too. She doesn\u2019t do any of this for anyone but me. She the craziest little fluffball weirdo I\u2019ve ever owned, probably the neediest too, but she truly seems to love me.

                "My Fiona is a Tuxedo cat and I got her when she just about 9 weeks old. To say I was unprepared is an understatement. I got her on a whim cause I overhead some co-workers talking about one of them looking to gave away some kittens as they literally had a box full of them. They were abandoned at very young ages so rehabilitated them. The next day after work Fiona was in my arms. Co-worker did warn me tho as unlike the others who were shy and timid this one was feisty and full of energy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTook me a few days of googling and trial & error to finally get the hang of things. The true moment that said she's my soul mate wasn't just one there was a few. For instance at some point she stopped meowing like crazy when it's feeding time. Instead she'll come find me give me little chirp thing and lead me to her bowl. She's become so accustomed to this she'll go into the cupboard and take out her kibble to hand it to me. Then waits patiently between my feet while mix in her kibble with her wet food. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow smart and bold she is also struck me. I tried putting a collar on her with a little bell but she let known she hated it. When I finally got it on her properly I turned to go do something else and literally two minutes later she just staring at me. Then I noticed her collar was gone. I have no idea how but in the span of less than 2 minutes she ripped the collar and placed it next to the garbage bin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt wasn't until my mother pointed out that the cat's behavior is exactly like how I was as a child. Try to get the cat to just do something she'll fight you, make a mess and then watch you dead in your eyes. So you have to negotiate with the cat like a human. I swear from the way I talk and argue with this cat you'd think it's an episode of Suits or something.",

I was tired of being lonely and I lived down the street from petsmart. I went to Walmart first and got all the food, litter, toys for a cat then went over to petsmart.\n\nI explained I was a college kid who worked so she'd need to be chill but that I'd be home with her every day between class and work and that I was definitely willing to play but wanted a cat that likes to hang out if I was doing homework or watching TV. \n\nThe worker said I know just the one! She handed me this tuxedo cat named Pickles and she instantly curled into me as if she was giving me a hug. \n\nI told the worker I didn't need to see any other cats, this was my cat and she chose me.\n\nShe remained nameless for a few days until i was driving on the highway home from work (I was kinda in a meditative state) and it hit me, Happy.

Fluffy was the only little chunky fluffy one and I kept her. Seeing her growing up to a few months was my highlight of my day. One day when I was at work my little brother got a puppy who was a bit younger than fluffy. He thought my fluffy would hurt his puppy and put her outside the fence of the house. I lived near a highway and she was ran over. My heart hurt for weeks and it was so bad that I couldn\u2019t speak to him because of that pain I felt.

Her name is Callie, and she\u2019s just as fluffy as my original one. Well one time I saw a picture of the original fluffy I had and I burst into tears.

                "In early 2014 my childhood cat, Bambi, got very sick at 14 YO. I made the decision to put her down, but it was the hardest thing I've ever had to do and I wasn't strong enough to even stay in the room with her, something I'm ashamed of to this day. I was heart broken and decided I could never replace her.\n\nIn late 2014 I was in a new city going to a new college and my mom and grandma flew in to spend the holidays with me. I had just turned 21. My mom said if I felt I was ready, she would take me to get a kitten for my birthday present. I agreed to go look, but still had a hard time with the thought of getting another cat.\n\nWe got to the shelter and walked around, and I looked into one cage and there were two grey 5 MO kittens and one of them immediately bolted to the front and started howling and reaching through the holes in the plastic for me. I thought it was cute and kept walking. My mom was behind me and once I was gone the cat laid down and didn't pay my mom any attention. \n\nI circled back around and again, she jumped up and ran over and cried, reaching for me. Again I passed, my mom walked up and told me to come back and suggested I have her taken to a side room to meet. I did, and she immediately jumped onto my lap, curled up and purred up a storm. Of course I chose her and she is my Lyla, she turned 9 this year. My mom likes to say she demanded me lol",

They called me back while we were driving, and when they told me where they were located, I just happened to be about three blocks away, headed in their direction. I was there in two minutes. When I saw the tiny gray kitten run past, I knew she was mine. \n\nI'm not a religious person by any means, but I always liked to say that god found a little piece of my soul on his workshop floor and he wanted to get it to me, so he sent it down to me in a little gray kitten.

                "Picture at Covid, March 2020. I was taking care of my grandmother, who had broken her wrist.  Since the pandemic was going on, and I didn\u2019t have Internet, my son and myself moved into her house because she had room.  It was frustrating as hell.  Grandma was very finicky and had early signs of dementia.  So one night after work because I was still working in person.  I decided to stop at one of my friends houses on the way home.  We are sitting at her kitchen table. The door was open, but the screen door was not.  All of the sudden this kitten is at the front door.  Crying trying to get attention. We were like OK what\u2019s going on with this cat?  A couple of days later it\u2019s the same situation.  We are just sitting at her dining room table chatting, and this cat comes back.  Like he wants to come in and hang out with us.   So I go get the cat bring him and give him some water.  My friend is allergic to cats, but she agrees we should give him some water. And a little bit of tuna.  I come back a few days later, and Cat is still lurking around the house.  We are convinced somebody abandoned this cat.  So that night I put the cat in my car. (he pooped in the backseat by the way). I took him to another friend of ours house.  Maybe he will thrive better over there on a not so busy street.  A couple of hours after dropping him off, I felt so guilty.  So guilty I went over and found him after an hour of looking. He was wet and scared. So I load him back up in my car.  I bring him back to my house.  I run to get basic supplies for the cat, thinking hey my brothers girlfriend works at an animal shelter. She\u2019ll be able to find something or someone to help me with this beautiful tuxedo beast. After about a week of searching for someone to take this poor animal on I decided I\u2019m just gonna keep him.  He\u2019s cool we\u2019ll go to the vet and get all of his stuff done.  Turns out he\u2019s only a year old.  Got all of the shots and everything for free because of a program with my brothers girlfriend for people adopting stray animals and not just dumping them on the shelter. He is thriving.  He is a hunter.  Everyone loves him.  He does not like to be inside.  Unless it\u2019s storming or it is cold.

We had really grown up together and I didn't know if I could even exist in a world without him. He was with me when I was dealing with depression and anxiety and suicidal ideation. The first time I really contemplated actually going through with it, he came into the room, rubbed around my legs, and sat and meowed at me. I don't know whether I would have gone through with it if he hadn't been there and it honestly kinda scares me to think about it. I knew I couldn't leave him. So I stayed for him. \n\nThen, when he passed, I reached my lowest of lows. I couldn't even fathom why anyone would ever want to be alive. After about a month I ended up adopting a 2-month-old kitten who had been dumped at a friend's house. I didn't really feel the connection with her until one day when I was really suicidal, I went into the same room, in the same spot I had before. I was just pleading with God to let me die somehow and she came in, rubbed around my feet, and sat meowing at me. That was the day I started seeking help. I promised her I wouldn't leave her alone and promised my first cat I would take care of her for as long as she lived. \n\nSasha is now 4 years old and I am in a much better place than I was back then.

There was this horrible void, deep settled unrest inside of me so I just couldn't stay home and went outside to sit on a bench. So I sat and saw this ginger cat that was sniffing a flower, and I thought it looked so peaceful and pretty, and I felt bitter because I just couldn't enjoy the sight with all that grief inside. A bit off topic but I'd seen the cat before and had given him treats whenever I could, and I remember thinking he had owners bcs he was wearing a collar all the time. So, anyway, the cat noticed me and purred his way onto my lap to curl up and make some biscuits. It was the first time I had any cat come up to me and the first time a cat would knead me. He was a fluffy adorable purring ball of warmth that made me feel a little better, and I appreciated it immensely! I started going outside to sit and pet the cat every evening until one day I found out from neighbors that the guy was kicked out by his previous owners, so that day I took him home with me ![img](emote|t5_2qhta|7949)",

I then ended up in the hospital and after the third day of me not showing up, she came into the house looking for me. She then waited on my bed for two weeks until I got back.

They said he was a handsome tripod who was very sweet and friendly, he lived in the shelter all his life when they took him in as a kitten his leg was so severely injured they had to remove it. Some people adopted him and returned him after only 3 months. It broke my heart seeing him in there. they gave him to me for free.\n\nWhen he got home he was scared, of course, and was a constant under the bed dweller. I put blankets under the bed so he could relax and every night I would visit him and just pet him (his absolute favorite thing)  I used to get sad thinking he would never be happy here. We got another cat , Ali, to keep him company. She really got him to come out of his shell. One day while I was petting him I realized he\u2019s just like me, just needing space to be himself. He is the most gentle and non- aggressive cat I\u2019ve ever owned. There is not one mean bone in his body. I started to really respect our relationship, I noticed how happy he was to just exist as himself. This has been the most rewarding relationship I\u2019ve had with a cat in a very long time. I know we have our own special bond and he trusts me and I\u2019m glad we did that together (:",

I brought her home that evening, showed her where her stuff was, put out some dinner and just left her alone for a few hours to let her adjust a little. When I went to bed, I figured she'd sleep under the bed or something. Nope. The moment my head hit the pillow, she hopped up,  got settled right behind my knees and been there ever since.

She always comes when she feels I'm not in mood. When i wait for her she comes running and meowing. She purrs and make biscuits at her favourite spot. Under the table. Weird spot? Yes.

Back to my other baby tho.

I begged and begged to change cats until he finally got annoyed and told me whatever(fun fact, my friend actually paid for her) At first he wouldnt let me take her home and made me leave her in his moms shed he was staying in then finally we got into a big fight (sadly it wasnt the last like it should of been) where he hit me multiple times, i defended myself and the cops were called. I went to jail and my parents drove at 1 am to try and talk to the cops (my mom had been on the phone while we fought, while i screamed for him to get away) his mom defended him and since she had been there (she was asleep, only woke up to the cops) they believed her over my own mom. I spent the night in jail but before i went i begged my dad, screamed about how he had to get my kitten, he cant let him have her and my dad came through. He took her much to my exes dismay and then she lived with me. We stayed for 2 more years with him until he cheated for the last time and i ran. I cant count how many times i vented to her, how many times i cried into her fur and lied to her that i was leaving, that this was the last time. She was there for the worst parts and i regret staying so much, not because id gone through it but because she had too.

The anime has be great and easily in my own top 3 for this season alongside BSD and JJK. I am already emotionally attached to Miyo. Direction in this anime is great.  \n\n\nI imagine JJK gets a big boost next week considering the most recent episode was yesterday. S2 started off strong, but yesterday is when the peak of JJK finally gets started. The rest of the season should be a wild ride since I am expecting it to really build on the manga and the overall adaptation in itself has been fantastic.   \n\n\nReally happy to see BSD getting into the top ten. Considering how its not popular outside of Japan. But the run from the beginning of S4 to where we are now is an insane run. An absolute must watch if you aren't already.",

I wouldn't be surprised if we'd see a delay.\n\nThe 2nd episode of **zom100** already tells me i'm not gonna be happy with the writing and this was after i tempered my expectations by a lot.\n\n**Undead Girl Murder Farce** is undoubtedly AOTS.

                "Oh yeah that makes so much more sense, and it would've made Gohan look way cooler in the tournament",
                "Considering Toytaro couldn\u2019t even be bothered to draw the actual fight and instead let it all happened off panel, no. This wasn\u2019t a cool moment for Gohan, it was Toyotaro admitting even he can\u2019t do shit with Gohan.",
                "Personally no. Goku\u2019s a much more interesting guy to watch fight imo and I preferred his dynamic with the Saiyan Girls than Gohan\u2019s to Kefla\u2019s in the manga.\n\nI do think they could have really made something of that Gohan/Kefla fight tho and it was wasted potential with how it ended up. Most of what would have been that fight was off-screened and was really just a disservice to both characters imo.",
                "Gohan was deff better",
                "Kefla would have mopped the floor with Gohan in the anime.",
                "People are really underselling not only Caulilfa and Kale, but fusion as well just to pretend their boy winning this makes sense.\n\nBy a ton.",
                "Yes because a i feel like it didnt make sense that the u6 sayins were able to keep up with goku especially since he was able to go toe to toe with people like beerus and gokublack  and especially the fact he had to use ultra instinct to win but the scene where he sticks his feet in the wall and slides down plus the sliding kamehameha make it really good so idk",
                "What I wish, is that Kefla wasn't a thing and they instead just kept Kale as U6's Ace. \n\n\nThat way they could have built off the hype Kale's berserker form had in the beginning of ToP, and not have this wonky ass power scaling where Caulifla is treated as the same tier as Goku in a base to base basis, whereas Kale is way stronger than Goku Blue who was in full health, with just normal berserker sayian, yet an exhausted SSJ2 Goku is not only equal to SSJ2 Caulifla but can also match  a much stronger version of Berserker Kale, at the same time.... \n\n...Despite Caulifla not getting a powerup beyond plain SSJ2, Goku supposedly having less energy than in the beginning of the tournament, and Kale supposedly getting stronger yet somehow treated as the same ballpark as Caulifla despite her alleged powerup, to a form that was already portrayed as beyond either of them at that....\n\n\nThe power scaling of the ToP anime is a headache, and it all can be blamed on them wanting to force a fusion arc between Kale and Caulifla when it wasn't necessary at all.",
                "Not really, no.\n\nWithout something like the Beast form explaining it, Gohan's power increase was too farfetched in the ToP, even with his ridiculous latent ability.\n\nU6 Saiyans pull things out of THEIR asses too.  Just ONE of them eliminated multiple entire teams out of the tournament.  And Kale was likely SSBlue level or above when she was a berserker.  Caulifla is quite a quick study herself.\n\nThe two of THEM...FUSED...should've been too much for Gohan to efficiently handle.  You can't claim \"crazy potential\" when his opponent WHEN SEPARATED had stupid potential as well.\n\nAs annoying as Ultra Instinct kinda was in the ToP, it was still the preferable method to dealing with Kefla.  Him taking on Jiren first proved Goku could use this new power effectively and set a decent scale in the anime.  Gohan was suddenly able to take Kefla nearly out of NOWHERE in the manga.\n\nSo no, I INTENSELY feel the anime did the Kefla fight better.  Hell, the anime ToP in GENERAL was superior to the manga version of it.  That arc was the worst among Toyotaro's catalog.",
                "Yes. Would have been better than the Dyspo fight.",
                "Hell nah. Then we wouldn't have gotten Surfing  Kamehameha.",
                "Kefla doesn\u2019t deserve to be ui Goku level",
                "yeah this would of gave gohan more of a drive. no need to put her against goku and have her go all the way up too his power scale that was total bs and not needed.",
                "And see beast gohan here? Yes",
                "I mean the hardest flex that Goku ever did.",
                "Yes, imagine if Gohan did the sliding Kamehameha?! Redemption for all the poor writing he got in Super.",
                "The anime fight was cooler. Would have enjoyed a better fight for Gohan, but them learning about transformations, and Goku slowly working his way back up to blue and UI was far more entertaining.",
                "Yes.\n\nNot only it would give Gohan a moment to shine, but the power scaling would make much more sense.",
                "It would have made kefla seem too weak and gohan too strong",
                "Nah fuck that, Gohan should've been nowhere near Kefla",
                "Damn I didn't even realize the anime differed so much now I wanna know what else was changed.",
                "Depending on what part of the intetnet you're on, you can absolutely see an animation where Gohan and Kefla \"go at it\"",
                "I would've given Gohan and Kefla a round. If they would've had their fight with Kefla one round in against Gohan it would've made all the difference in how she would be recieved.",
                "I feel like this is a bit of information not mentioned (or should have been) in OP\u2019s post for those who don\u2019t know:\n\nThe manga had to catch up with the anime and made slight differences (such as this post) from the anime.\n\nThat said, for me personally, I would have preferred to watch Gohan fight Kefla instead of Goku. I appreciate Toriyama giving Gohan some spotlight in the manga showcasing his strength by going toe-to-toe against a *fusion Saiyan with a berserker state* and being evenly matched. As opposed to how the anime underwhelmed him.\n\n![gif](giphy|Vwpat09TH5rXkEClTg|downsized)",
                "I think UI Goku is still ok as Kefla didn\u2019t even stand a chance against him. Gohan on the other hand, shouldn\u2019t even be equal to Kefla, considering how in the Majin buu saga, even Buuhan with Piccolo and Gotenks absorbed couldn\u2019t even compared to SSJ1 Vegito",
                "Kefla woulda won I think, Gohan slacks to much on his training",
                "The 360 mctwist kamehameha basically nullified any issues I had because it was so cool as to be worth trading gohan for ! Personally\n\nI\u2019ll take rule of cool over \u2018powerscaling \u2018 every time these days , DB is far less of a headache once you stop caring about powerscaling and just \u2026. Enjoy it for what it is .",
                "Yes , way better than getting knocked out by a bunny",
                "Honestly... Nah. Goku's fight against Kefla was one of the most amazing, iconic fights of the series. While I do like to see Gohan fight like that but UI Goku fight scenes are just better imo",
                "we would\u2019ve lost the fucking awesome kamehameha but yeah",
                "yeah because they disrespected Super Saiyan Blue too much. Kefla was straight beating the crap of Super Saiyan God and had edge over Blue and Kaioken. That was absurd.  Goku had to resort to Ultra instinct to beat her. \n\nGohan is top tier saiyan hybrid with potential that rivals Caulifla (She was shown to be a genius from Universe 6) and boost from Kale in fusion should have made them rival Gohan not Goku.",
                "No. To my understanding Kefla had more beef with Goku and that Kamehameha surf thing was sweet. \n\nThat said Gohan definitely could've been showcased better in the anime.",
                "Maybe if this fight was actually shown.\n\nGoku vs Kale & Caulifla is one of the best fights in DB super, both animation wise and actual fight progression wise. In addition, Gohan has tones of moments in the anime that build his character and make him look cool.\n\nGohan vs Kefla is nothing but a disservice to both Gohan & Kefla, a 4 page off screen battle that doesn't even get a proper conclusion.",
                "I love Gohan and I loved the fact that he went toe to toe with Kefla in the manga. But having it in the anime means denying us the scene where UI Goku showed her just how little he respects her.",
                "Nah. Manga is great but anime is more about spectacle. And showing off UI Goku and generating hype is better for the anime.\n\nHowever, I believe this question works for Roshi. \u201cThe final most powerful kamehameha\u201d vs Roshi\u2019s mastery and technique leading to showing Goku the door to UI.",
                "Who cares about Gohan?",
                "Man I can\u2019t give up the coldest kamehameha but if they ever do a Kai for super I\u2019d love to watch this fight it\u2019s make beast & Keflas power make more sense",
                "Absolutely",
                "Would've made more sense for Kefla to be SSB level powerscaling wise but UI Sign Goku was cool as hell. That Kamehameha fucking slaps.",
                "Gohan\u2019s character development < swag kamehameha slide",
                "Would have power scaled a lot better if so.",
                "Yes the scaling would work much better and Both characters are more intresting when paired together than Goku",
                "No, the fight we got was better than any Gohan vs kefla fight we would have gotten. So glad the anime changed that , would have been a truly boring fight",
                "Yes, anime wanked tf out of Goku",
                "Yes. But only if Gohan did the badass Kamehameha wave slide aswell",
                "That's how you know they shit on Gohan. They know many people don't read the manga but will pull this crap in the anime without anyone knowing. I was like, wtf, when Goku beat her?",
                "Power-scaling wise, I could stand Goku and Kefla's fight.\n\nGohan and Kefla was a power-scaling mess...",
                "Yes because the power scaling is a lot more believable in the manga.",
                "Nah, as much as I woudjve liked it, that kamehameha slide was fire",
                "Have Gohan do the slide kamehameha and instantly yes",
                "No",
                "Absolutely not, this made zero sense and it only served to wank Gohan for no reason. But of course Gohan fans ignore that and loved this nonsense",
                "Nah. Gohan is such a boring fighter. With Goku, you get a little something different each fight, whether it's the following ki blasts he used on the girls, the ki blasts from his finger gun, or using his Kamehameha to glide on Kefla's blast.",
                "No! Gohan doesn\u2019t need any more Saiyan in his life. Let him find his own path. Plus Goku needed his limit to be pushed to the extreme to beat Jiren.",
                "Absolutely. Makes WAYYYY more sense\n\nEdit: to the people downvoting me without making any counter argument, riddle me this. How exactly does a person who couldn\u2019t go super saiyan not that long ago and a wanna be broly add up to super saiyan blue? They wanked the SHIT out of kefla in the show and made her WAYYYYY more powerful than she had any business being.",
                "Yeah absolutely, this is my favorite change the Manga makes and the only good part of the fight is the surfing Kamehameha which he could've done vs., Jiren instead.",
                "If it was before Broly. . Sure. However knowing what we know now about Broly, the fact that Kale is essentially Universe 6\u2019s Broly, and the fact that due to being a Sadalan Saiyan she would have even greater potential than him. . It makes a bit more sense that it took UI to take Kefla down.",
                "Hell yea, way better fight. People just remember the end to goku/kefla, but the rest of the fight is meh",
                "Was it a great moment for Gohan and would have worked better as a whole? Yes. But did you see that fucking sliding Kamehameha? That shit was sexy so it\u2019s worth it imo.",
                "If it wasn\u2019t for how well the fight was animated, I would say yes. But that kamehameha\u2026.",
                "It wouldve made more sense but at the same time that Kamehameha at the end of their fight",
                "Yes, it makes much more sense power scaling wise and is much better for gohans character\n\n\nBut.... that kamehameha was too sexy",
                "As flashy as anime ToP was the manga handled the whole thing far better.",
                "No. Anime was far better. And their fusion being so powerful made sense. Gohan going out with dispo was also better",
                "Not really, Goku definitely made way more sense to fight her than Gohan did and Goku only barely made sense to begin with if anyone should have thrown hands with Kefla it should have been Frieza",
                "No. The Manga fight wasn\u2019t good and made no sense it was just Toyotaro tryna please Gohan fans at the expense of nerfing Kefla. Kale by herself was able to overpower ssb Goku and Golden Frieza. So how was Gohan able to keep up with Kefla? Just terrible writing.",
                "Nah Gohan is boring in the anime even in superhero he was just useless most the movie well I guess most were excluding gammas but even when he went beast he had like 5 minutes of screen time after he transformed did a special beam cannon and went back to boring plus that sliding kamehameha is anime exclusive so I\u2019d rather have that then Another probably boring Gohan scene",
                "Nope",
                "I wanted them to mate, so yes ofc\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6uvgn4boiucb1.jpeg?width=736&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6da476130cb3fa6da360a9578f7ef3fd54d050f9",
                "No because of the Tokyo drift Kamehameha",
                "I wish Gohan was the main character we deserved in Z and they didn't bitch out after the Cell Saga.",
                "gohan does need more screen time but god that kamehameha is so iconic and cant be replaced",
                "I think it should've been both. Gohan, piccolo, and goku would've fought kefla. I would've rather had piccolo eliminated by kefla rather than a tiny ass bug piccolo definitely was well equipped against. We still could've had the Tony hawk kamehameha rave from ui goku",
                "People would put a lot more respect on Gohans name if it went this way",
                "maybe but the we wouldn't have gotten the kamahama grind",
                "I think that made a lot more sense that a rusty gohan fight the fusion of two new super saiyans then two new super saiyans fight goku and challenge him. I get goku was tired but there\u2019s always so many excuses. A tired ss god should still be able to stomp a basic ss fusion.",
                "Yes because her fighting ssg > ui goku makes no fucking sense",
                "And not get that fucking kamehameha!!!!!! No way.",
                "No. ToP is better in the anime even with its faults",
                "Honestly, I kinda wish it had been Kefla vs. Gotenks. She was so keen to get to Super Saiyan 3. Keeping her at around Gotenks's power level (or saying he'd gotten stronger since Buu) and letting them take each other out would have been badass.",
                "Yes I would have loved to see that animated although I believe goku should have still did that kamehameha he could\u2019ve did it on anilaza instead of kefla it wouldve made more sense that way anyways. Everyone gets beat up by anilaza and then goku goes ui and just does that sick kamehameha after dodging a bunch of blasts",
                "That sliding Kamehameha is one of the best in the series, sorry gohan but Goku's fight stays",
                "No cause we wouldn't have gotten the Kamehameha skate, the greatest moment in Dragon Ball history",
                "Kamehameha grind says no.",
                "Nah fuck Gohan and his character development\n/sarcasm",
                "I agree",
                "Nah. Slide kamehameha over a twister ice-cream, is peak dragonball",
                "I would've preferred that Goku just eliminated them with  SSJG before Kefla appeared.",
                "Gohan should've played a more pivotal role in winning the tournament, no matter how you slice it.",
                "50/50, 1 it woulda gave gohan a better moment. 2 no cause cabba, kale and caulifla were already set up to be stronger than people like gohan",
                "Gohan is married and kefla is two people. Maybe Gohan and caulifla had chemistry to go at it. But like dragonball isn\u2019t about cheating on wives etc. so I think it\u2019s good they didn\u2019t bang like you wish they did OP",
                "Yes, but that finisher is way too fire so no",
                "This is probably the difference between the manga and anime that drives me the craziest. Massive difference between Gohan who got Dyspo to fall out of the ring with him only cause he had Friezas help compared to being able yo defeat Kefla. The feats are sucha massive difference and in terms of power it makes manga Gohan seem a level above himself in the anime.",
                "Gohan should have been in the anime and he should have done the skidding Kamehameha!",
                "Caulifla vs. Gohan would be fire. \n\nThe weaker fighter with a will to fight that matches Goku pitted against Gohan, the wunderkind that really really doesn't want to fight, but turns into another step of demi God after a day of training.",
                "Honestly I'm not sure. The way they've portrayed Ultra Instinct in the anime is different from Manga. I also think that it was a necessary plot for Goku to improve his Ultra Instinct even further. Now the fight with Gohan (I'd say that is debatable). But I think Goku Vs Kefla is still better than Gohan Vs Kefla (at least the way they showed it in anime). Also that Kamehameha at the end (Sheeeesh).",
                "For story purposes sure, but the result in the manga was a really underwhelming fight and Goku's Kamehameha slide was one of the coolest shit he's ever done",
                "Not really",
                "Gohan fighting Universe 6\u2019s entire namekian race was cooler",
                "Even if Goku was the one to finish her, I would\u2019ve liked to have seen Gohan take a shot at her in the anime.",
                "No, because Gohan in the anime isn\u2019t as strong in comparison to kefla and goku as he is in the manga",
                "fck kefla",
                "Gohan winning against Kefla makes no sense. There is no way Gohan stands up to a fusion of a SS2 and Berserk Kale who btw was fucking everybody up in the manga. Vegito was out here beating Buuhan with ease and you guys want me to believe Gohan (who rarely trains) is a match for a fusion that is at the very least comparable. Powerscaling in the manga makes absolutely no sense.",
                "No. It doesn't make sense to me that gohan could keep up with SSJ2 kefla.",
                "Yes :in terms of more balanced power creep , and no : since the fight was very cool",
                "No the ultra instinct kamehameha vs kefla is one of the coolest db moment for me",
                "Strength wise it would make way more sense for Kefla to be about ult Gohan level.",
                "Manga wise yes, but anime wise, no. \n\n\n\nIt was one of the hypest parts of the anime\n\n\n*\u201dYou need to face the facts, Kefla. You CANNOT stop me now!\u201d*",
                "If It werent for The Gangsta Kamehameha i would say yes,but i cant let It go",
                "Nope. Goku vs the girls, leading into UI vs Kefla, is my fav fight in Super. \n\nIt goes through every single saiyan form, with Goku taking them more and more serious, and them learning and one-upping him a little more with each attack, escalating into the newest form of the series fighting a new overpowered fusion. \n\nIt's everything I love about DB fights, and a period where Super thoroughly understood the fanservice the show should provide. It's perfect. \n\nGohan deserves every dub possible but his fight with her wasn't anywhere near the spectacle of the anime.",
                "Ui sign was cool but I would\u2019ve liked to see more from gohan",
                "Oh you meant fighting ....",
                "I think gohan deserves this fight more but I wouldn\u2019t trade that sick Tony hawk move goku did",
                "Absolutely, Anime Kefla was a massive waste of the character. They basically wrote her out just to dickride Goku.",
                "While Kefla's K.O in the anime was cool and all, personally, Y E S. GIVE SOME GLORY TO S CHARACTER THAT I S N T GOKU!!!!",
                "It should be neither but ui was better.",
                "Beast Gohan vs SSB Kefla in a future match up let's go",
                "Yes.\n\nIt kinda sucks when its always the same character winning against everyone",
                "100% wished this would have happened over the goku fight. I honestly felt like in the anime her character was so broken, but against ultimate gohan it made me feel like a more realistic power scaling of just how strong gohan really is and how strong she was. However that ending kamahamaha splitting her in two was amazing and won\u2019t take away from that!",
                "Being able to stalemate kefla > being able to beat Dyspo with the help of Frieza",
                "[removed]",
                "All this did was either show; \n\nHow weak a fusion of Kefla is, which it shouldn't be.\n\nOr show how strong Gohan has become, which he shouldn't be.\n\nBad match up, bad arc overall.",
                "Not really. Gohan shouldn\u2019t get to fight kefla due to her strength. Kefla nearly beat Goku in a fight and gohan doesn\u2019t have as much power as Goku\nTherefore the fight is kinda one sided \n\n(Sorry I do think it would\u2019ve been cool for this gohan kefla fight to happen but the powerscaler in me can\u2019t agree from a logical perspective)",
                "Yes. If that's what happened in manga, why change the story?",
                "I present to you, the entire story of Dragon Ball in one sentence: Akira Toriyama planned for Gohan to do it, but Goku was just way way cooler",
                "In regards to the story it would have made more sense. It makes sense that a worn down Goku was having to actually put effort into the fight. If the world's most fit fighter were to challenge me, someone that has no skill in fighting, but they had been awake for 6 days straight and had practically no energy then I might be able to land a few good hits. Anyway, Gohan vs Kefla would have been a fun fight.",
                "Honestly wouldnt have believed Gohan taking out a fusion that strong. But thats just me.",
                "No cuz gohans \"fight\" was almost all off screen and him being on par with a saiyan fusion dosent make any sense what ever you may think of the female saiyans thier fusion in ss being on gohan level espically in the manga version dosent make any sense",
                "Yes. Caulifla and Kale, and Kefla, have no business standing up to sayans or Goku\u2019s caliber. Even Goku of Majin Saga should be enough against kefla.",
                "Nah, that kamehameha counter was legendary",
                "If it wasn\u2019t for that sliding kamehameha, I would say Gohan",
                "Nah, Gohan only gets built up to be absolutely useless",
                "Yeah so his beast form gets to show that he is indeed much stronger...",
                "Would've been a better way to introduce Beast Gohan imo",
                "Nah I liked the Goku fight more. Gohan really shouldn\u2019t be that strong anyway, he doesn\u2019t train and just relies on plot to grow.",
                "Yes, but instead of a tie let Gohan win and do what everything else in the ToP as well.",
                "Wish that for Gohan vs. Kefla in the manga Gohan shift from Mystic to Super Saiyan as a way to get an advantage, since how I see between Super Saiyan and Mystic is that Super Saiayn grants him more power but Mystic grants him more speed.",
                "The Manga fight was flaccid by comparison.",
                "Yes because the fight was awesome, it demonstrates just how powerful Gohan is without making him a significant player, Kefla is a good match for him. A Saiyan with insane potential and a Saiyan with experience and talent. Put them together and you get someone who can match Gohan.",
                "Yes I think it made way more sense for ultimate gohan to contend with kefla than goku. Goku not having energy and still fighting and like gaining energy was kinda lame. I don\u2019t really like the im down I\u2019m up I\u2019m down I\u2019m up I\u2019m down I\u2019m up. They did it all through super and it was the worst in the goku black arc. If they would\u2019ve gone back in time again I would\u2019ve stopped watching that was stupid.",
                "I wish the anime would have followed the Manga overall. The way UI was unlocked was better, the mix of characters getting to do stuff is better, and the power scaling makes more sense (No Krillin fighting SSB, Android 17 fighting SS3).",
                "The fight between Goku and Kefla was awesome, but having Gohan beat her makes way more sense.",
                "Go at it hehehe",
                "Yes",
                "I like that it really put into perspective just how strong gohan actually is, him being able to match a fusion of a LSSJ and all, but frankly the fight with goku and kefla is just too fuckin good to trade out imo.\n\nNot sure ch cooler than GRINDING OFF OF AN ENEMIES BEAM ONLY TO THEN UNLEASH YOUR OWN AT POINT BLANK.\n\nReminds me a lot of the warp Kamehameha that goku did againt cell.",
                "Don't shoot me but I prefer the goku v kefla fight, it's just more appealing to me then gohan's fight in my op. Also Tony Hawk Kamehameha is just built different.",
                "Any time someone other than Goku gets to do something it's going to be a yes from me. I miss people being important. So I miss DB lol",
                "One of the few things the anime did better. I loved the Beam-Grind Kamehameha",
                "No",
                "Yes because going by potara logic kefla should been weaker in the anime because if one user is stronger than  one by alot it wouldn't be that much of a boost and could be considered a downgrade in some ways",
                "Power scaling wise it wouldnt be really logic for gohan to beat kefla not even close\nIts more logic that they needed ui goku \nAlready kale alone in her berzerk mode destroyed ssj blue goku  so a fusion of her with caulifla would need beast gohan to be defeated not only ultimate gohan\n\nAlso of we consider that kale if the equivalant of broly in their universe i dont see gohan wining against a fused kale and caulifla without beast\n\nYes it would be better for gohan character devlopement but it destroyes all kale and caulifla power levels logic \n\nSince u6 saiyans are my favorite characters after bardock and vegeta i would rather see them shine then gohan",
                "YES i would preferred this 100%",
                "Naw. I like Kefla being Busted with Power. It shakes things up with her being able to somewhat Rival UI. Give her some training in technique and fighting style and she\u2019s curb stomping a lot of your favs",
                "No, Goku needed to perfect his Mary Sue powers.",
                "I dunno. Part of me wanted gohan to do it but part of me felt gohan shouldn't have been strong enough to do it without beast.",
                "[removed]",
                "TBH, I just wish Caulifla did more in general. She was a great combo of Vegeta and Goku to me and I really wanted her to be more than a vehicle for Kale.",
                "No",
                "If it was a proper full fight instead of just a bunch of offscreen action then yes, but then again, we wouldn\u2019t get UI Goku\u2019s Smoking Sexy Style Kamehameha.",
                "Nah, Goku vs Kefla was one of my favorite fights in the entire ToP.",
                "Interesting choice of words",
                "I\u2019m conflicted, on one part, it was a HUGE Gohan W in the manga and showed Kefla still being weaker than the U7 saiyans. However, the sliding Kamehameha is hands down one of the best finishers in Dragon Ball history. So like\u2026 I dunno. One makes more sense I guess and lets a character I like a lot shine, but holy shit that sliding Kamehameha!",
                "Yes. The Kamehameha thing was cool but giving gohan something good is better. Also, I still think the progression of ultra instinct was handled poorly during the tournament.",
                "yeah it would have been  a better fight and it'd actually give us a sense of how strong gohans ultimate form has gotten",
                "Alot of people cope so hard over kefla being upper goku level.\n\nA berserker kale, weaker than controlled kale stomped all over pre UI blue goku. NONE OF THEM CAN KILL, It isnt an excuse for goku.\n\nSsj2 Caulifla is fighting with pre ui ssj2 goku\n\nIn the buu saga we have 2 characters weaker than Buutenks fusing to be able to overpower BUUHAN in base form with 0 Diff.\n\nWe have 2 Characters weaker than dabura fusing together to be able to be as strong as super buu. (Yes goten and trunks are weaker than dabura)\n\nThere is no reason to be shocked that a fusion of 2 characters at bare minimum as strong as ssj2 goku that are also high potential saiyans (an excuse people love to rely on for gohan) is able to be stronger than god goku, and stronger than blue goku kaioken as an ssj2.\n\nAnd No, goku was not exhausted when he got 1 shot by kefla, that episode let the writing do the talking. He was exhausted so he couldnt transform at the start of the fight, He then can go ssj, then 2, then 3 (a stressing form) then god, then blue and mixing it with kaioken (an even more stressing form) - there is no reason to assume hes still exhausted by this point when this is the most taxing transformation he had prior to mui",
                "On one hand I'm a \"Stick to the source\" kinda guy. On the other hand, we never would have gotten one of the best Kamehameha if it didn't happen.",

                "No, Goku vs Kefla is way cooler. People only act like they like Gohan vs Kefla cause he\u2019s being somewhat relevant\u2026 though again the only cool stuff Kefla does is in the anime against Goku.",
                "Yeah. Just keep in the Kamehameha.\n\nBut I felt they didn't know what to do with Gohan in the anime other than put him with Piccolo",

                "Honestly...no. It's not because I prefer the anime over the manga or anything like that, but the Goku and Kefla fight just felt better, Gohan and Keflas fight felt too basic and bland without the hype of UI. There's definitely a better way of explaining it like this but it just comes down to Goku and Keflas fight being more entertaining, and plus their fight makes more sense since Caulifla and Kale were constantly on Goku for a bit before they fused.",

They do look a bit unbalanced - it'd be nice if they had thicker legs to balance out their top halves - but they have cute squishy faces.\n\nGnomes are unexpectedly pretty. I think I'd actually prefer it if their facial proportions were a bit more squished. Then again, halflings look more like that, so maybe that's how they're distinguishing the two? I still think the gnomes should be more bug-eyed, with really sharp cheekbones or something to emphasise their fey origins.\n\nIt's kind of disappointing how the female githyanki look a lot more like attractive humans than the males, but at least they still have the fucked up noses. They're the first race that I would expect your average dudebro to not be attracted to, so I'm actually a little bit disappointed that they didn't go more all in on making them ugly. I like playing a cute character, but I know a lot of people who enjoy playing a fucked up looking creature, and I think it's important to give them options in a game like this.\n\nHalf-orcs are also really pretty, but a guy like this was never going to go for a \"rough\" looking character like a half orc in the first place. I do think they could stand to make half orcs a bit less pretty, but I also do appreciate how they all have a lil bit of an underbite for the tusks.\n\nHumans and tieflings both look gorgeous and, again, conventionally attractive.\n\nOkay, so at first with the dwarf comment I assumed that this guy has more of a preference for round, \"cute\" faces rather than sharper, \"pretty\" features. That's not an unreasonable preference to have. But the tieflings definitely have more of the sharp, mature look that the elves have, and it doesn't look that difficult to make a human with softer features. So I actually have no idea what criteria this guy is even judging attractiveness by. I went through all that effort and now I'm even more confused than before. Like, not that it even matters in the first place, but usually I kind of expect to be able to identify the \"ideal woman\" that these guys want all women to look like (usually an anime girl, but the type of anime girl may vary). But I'm totally lost here. My attempts at weird dude anthropology have hit a total dead end.\n\nAnyway, it's clearly possible to make a conventionally attractive female character of any race aside from \\*maybe\\* githyanki. Like they're going to be somewhat thick if they're a dwarf, but even then, it's not super dramatic. I just wish they'd stop skipping leg day.",

                "This is how I actually got into Dokkan. \n\nWhen it first came out I just played it a little bit without understanding what a gacha game is and how it works. So I kinda stopped after a while. But so remember seeing a scan of the V-Jump magazine which showed the UI form before it was in the anime. \n\nBack then I was really into dragon ball and used to soak up every drop of dragon ball content I could. Yes, even YouTubers like Qaaman and the likes. So seeing the V-Jump Scan in anticipation of what Gokus new for looks like was probably the hypest moment of my life. \n\nSo after I saw the scan and had a better idea of gacha and mobile games in general, I started playing it and getting this UI goku. Though I still didn\u2019t quite understood how Dokkan actually worked so it took me some time to actually build proper teams and dokkan awaken units etc. \n\nThanks for sharing this. Made me remember how hyped I was with my friends back then",

                "I remember pulling him and being so fucking happy only for him to be kinda mid for a few months until his awakening.",
                "Oh yeah. And didn't pull him. Big sad. Especially given how few category leads existed overall in the game then.",
                "Yeah i was still very new to the game when he dropped and i went super deep on his banner",
                "So extremely hype.. I remember buying tickets if I recall right it was 10 tickets and a 5 unit multi either way I got 2 copies back to back ticket multis it was so so clutch",
                "I\u2019ll never forget this banner.. I rainbowed him on that banner in under 700 stones",
                "Man, the nostalgia, this was right after I started playing Dokkan. Never pulled him though. Even to this day. Mine is 55% and I got him with coins.",
                "I remember he could hit for 800k and that was considered a crazy attack stat",
                "2017 I quit the game then came back during the 7th anni to pull the LR gods twice",
                "I remember pulling this boy and sending my friends a screenshot of it and they could not believe I got him. I had to like take a video to prove it wasn't doctored, cause I faked a lot of pulls with my friends before. That was back when my friends played dokkan...",

                "This was the first dokkan banner that I summoned on \ud83d\ude02",
                "I remember because it was my first banner I got UI goku off tickets with str SSB Vegeta right next to him then a few weeks later when rose and Vegetio BLUE dropped I got both of them and made a Realm of Gods team before getting Vegetio in 3rd ani and Phy Kefla and making Potaro + UI Goku team before I continued to where I am today 1700 days in and with nearly every Dokkanfest",

Their similarity is superficial at best. Just because it has a tournament doesn't make it \"Records of Ragnarok\".\n\nThere's also the Mushoku Tensei bit where he chose to focus on the worst possible thing. It's such a small part of the episodes out right now yet he chose to go all in on that one aspect, which is weird considering he's a fan of the show. His audience is massive and I'm sure a not small part of it watch his seasonal videos before picking up shows and now a good chunk of those would think it's all about what he's shown in this video.\n\nOverall, just a disappointing seasonal showcase from Gigguk.

Also, it's stupid to say the MC (Kaede) acts immature like Kazuya. Kaede is a kid. I think the show takes place in middle school or something? Unlike Kazuya who is in college, Kaede has every right to act like a cringey kid. And personally, compared to some kids I knew back when I was younger, he's acting more mature.",

They can also learn the moves scream to God, bark to God, moo to God, Cluck to God, fly to God, along with some having fur to hide nipples, so it\u2019d be incredibly easy for one to get you in the mood. With their abilities Consume and Hydrate, they can easily recover from fatigue with enough food and water. No other human woman comes close to this level of compatibility as God\u2019s creatures do. Also, fun fact, if you pull out enough, you can make your Godly creature turn white. The creature is literally built for human dick.

                "I imagine this a different route than most people with go with this, but legit the most disturbing anime I've seen is Green Green, a crappy little harem anime that I think was an adaptation of a dating sim (and frankly I'm not going bother to look any of this up because it's more effort than the show deserves).\n\nSee, Green Green is one of those anime where the main character has some friends that are way more pervy and gross than he is (and also very annoying).  Normally this is tolerable because said characters tend to quickly fade into the background as the main character gets wrapped up in whatever shenanigans the series is about.  Unfortunately, perhaps because the creators realized the central romance of the show is sort of bland and uninteresting, here their hijinks basically take up half the runtime of the series.\n\nBut wait, there's more!  They're also sexpests!  But sure, plenty of characters like that cross lines--but the thing that makes this show disturbing is that they don't do the usual anime thing of getting hit into the stratosphere in retaliation for their transgressions.  In fact, it's not clear that the show understands that they're even transgressing.\n\nThis comes to a head when they get mad at the main character, who has been avoiding them in favor of spending time with his crush.  Because when your so-called friends start sexually harassing your classmates, yeah, you maybe put some distance between you.  But the show frames them as in the right--that the main character needs to apologize for ditching the people who only seem to want to use his bland attractiveness to further their pervy schemes and have not shown one ounce of concern for his feelings.\n\nAnd the ending of the show, which I'm not even going spoiler tag because A) the show is old and B) if I can convince you to never watch this show it is my goddamn moral imperative to do so, completes this total failure of understanding by showing that the girls the pervy friends have spend the entire series sexually harassing are starting to warm up to them.\n\nI want to make it clear that I'm no prude; I enjoy risque shows.  But I've never seen one so disconnected from reality, to the point where I have to wonder if the creators genuinely believed the characters in question were sympathetic, of if this show was made so cynically that they believed their target audience would find them as such.\n\nThere are series out there that definitely have major characters do much worse things and get away with it; even ones where the fact that they can is both the point and the appeal.  And yet, those series must understand that what they do is transgressive, or gross, or immoral to work--that part of the thrill is the understanding that these things are wrong.  But I get no such impression that Green Green understands its pervy friend group is even unsympathetic, let alone criminal.  And that is much more disturbing than anything else I've seen in anime.",

                "I feel that a lot of time in anime things can get over the top to an extent that while it is visually violent and gory, it loses things a bit in terms of whether it is truly disturbing. Elfen Lied is probably the best example for me, yes it has massive amounts of violence and gore but it reached a point where things became comical and I wouldn't include on a \"most disturbing anime\" list. Other shows like Shiki and Another also fall into this.\n\nFor me the most disturbing things would be things that are less over the top but more close to life, even if there is a fantastical element to it for purposes of the plot. For a show as a whole, that probably goes to Now and Then Here and There, which while about a character who goes to another world (it actually is the dreaded word... isekai) is based on real life genocides and is about children being enslaved to become soldiers in a wanna be dictator's army. Torture, rape, abortion, suicide, children killing other children, etc... are all topics touched upon in it.\n\nThe single most disturbing episode of anime for me would probably go towards Bokurano episode 7. Overall its a show that I think suffers a bit too much from the over the topness that I mentioned above. Although its set up to focus most episodes on individual characters enables it to have some individual storylines that don't suffer as much as the show as a whole suffers. It is about [Bokurano]>!how an underage girl is groomed into having a sexual relationship with her teacher. The teacher films it, puts it on the internet and it soon comes out that he's been doing this with numerous other girls as well. And he's banging the girl's sister as well. She gets pregnant from it although both her and her baby subsequently die as the show's plot is all about how you die after piloting the giant robot.!< There was an episode of Paranoia Agent that was similar in nature [Paranoia Agent]>!A girl discovers that her father has been filming her undressing!<.\n\nOh, and I do totally agree with you on Belladonna of Sadness. I would strongly recommend anyone watch it simply for the unique visuals, but the subject matter is really hard to take.",

Yeah we all want to see more of Jellal but he fought the Seis alone, Wendy and Lucy are the biggest development and saved the world in Tartaros and Alvarez, Gray landed the killing blow to Mardgeer, and Sting took out his master and Larcade.\n\nPeople complain that Natsu and Erza take all the spotlight but that's not true. Every fans top 5 is completely different.",
                "I think it does a great job of providing escapism and a world that you\u2019d genuinely want to be in. \n\nOther series provide a very well built world with abilities you\u2019d love to have, but they usually have the downside of it being difficult to gain power or there being a good chance that you\u2019ll be killed. Using One Piece, Naruto and Dragon Ball as examples, (Haven\u2019t seen Bleach or i would of included it.)\n\nOne Piece: Want a devil fruit? Good luck, there\u2019s only one kind of each and a lot are silly, all coming with the downside of not being able to swim. Want to be a pirate? If you\u2019re caught you\u2019re going to be executed by the Navy. Want to be in the Navy? There\u2019s a chance of being killed by a pirate. Want to be a civilian? A chance of being plundered, enslaved, oppressed etc. Want to be a Straw Hat? Best you can do is being in the Straw Hat Grand Fleet, unless you\u2019re a unique species or have a gimmick crazy enough to get you a spot, in which case be ready to almost die on every island you go to.\n\nNaruto: There\u2019s a very good chance you can learn the Jutsu\u2019s but then you\u2019re at risk of death from warring villages, rogue ninja, rogue ninjas with Godlike powers or Aliens with Godlike powers. And good luck if you want to be in the Hidden Leaf because it seems like that place faces risk of destruction once a decade at the very least.\n\nDragonball: Humanity is at risk of becoming extinct every other arc. And you won\u2019t be able to do anything unless you\u2019re prepared for some long, deadly and often traumatic training.\n\nFairy Tail: Want to learn magic? Go for it, it\u2019ll take some work but nothing that\u2019ll give you PTSD or almost kill you, what\u2019s more you seemingly naturally get one that suits you best, otherwise you can always learn from others. Want to join Fairy Tail or other guilds? Go for it, as long as you\u2019re not a prick there\u2019s seemingly no joining requirements that we know of. Afraid of death? Don\u2019t worry there\u2019s only been a couple of potential extinction events, which by anime standards is good, and even then the death count is low so chances are you\u2019ll be fine. So just go make some friends, live a life of adventure, and receive a happy ending.\n\n\nNone of that is at all a criticism to those other mentioned series, just emphasising out that Fairy Tail has one of the best worlds that you\u2019d want to be transported too. And the sense of wonder (pun not intended) it gives by being such an enticing and joyful world is what I think it does right compared to other series. Because sometimes, amongst these dark, complex anime and manga series, (which again, not a criticism because they often end up being amazingly done and are fantastic stories to follow), you just want to be in for a good, fun time that\u2019ll leave you smiling.",

The filler arcs feel justified. \n\nThe women are badass and not weak or \"second class\". \nEspecially when I think about Lucy and Wendy. They were always useful for the the group in some way and their development over the series made them even better. They became believable well developed characters throughout the series.",

Some battle shonen series have amazing characters but those characters hardly interact or when they interact it's only story related.  It's cool when characters can just chill and goof around with each other.",
                "The next villain doesn't need to be literally stronger than the last one. Everyone using unique magic tend to turn villains into puzzles instead of something that is ten times stronger than the last guy. \n\nMany power ups for the heroes are temporary and the result of specific circumstances. Like natsu eating eather crystals, or becoming a lightning flame dragon.\n\nAlso the show really respects my time. It's pretty much the only shonen I've watched that doesn't have episodes dedicated to looking at everyone's shocked faces while 3 panels worth of content are adapted. In fairy  tail a fight that is introduced at the end of one episode, will normally be wrapped up by the end of the next",

There's talks to be made about if it delivers on a thing it's hyping up etc etc but for the most part the build up is done well, look at Gildarts, early Erza, and some of the best moments, arcs and fights in the series, the first half of the gmg, Tenrou, Tartaros, Natsu vs Jellal etc etc it does it all fantastically.\n\n\nAnd finally I think it's a series that does the trope of \"I'll do anything for my friends/family\" excellently, yes yes power of friendship but again look at the best moments the sacrifices the speeches it's all done spectacularly. My main point is Natsu, many characters can talk the talk but they Can't walk the walk, Natsu can and does.",

Yes Natsu is a demon and is the brother of the strongest wizard, but in the end he chooses to be human and doesn\u2019t receive some godlike awakening. His power grows through sheer will or the help of others.\n\n* Does humor well. Admittedly there\u2019s not lot of anime to me that balances humor with other themes and when it does it\u2019s usually unintentionally. One Piece is one the few anime that also balances humor pretty well, but Fairy Tail is the only anime I personally think does it better at least sometimes.",

Each had distinct and touching personalities that anyone can fall in love with at least 5 characters or more.

And then you have Erza, who mostly covers the female side with her tranformations. Then you also have stuff like, natsus shirt constantly being destroyed or open, or lucys star dresses. I did orignally think that Erza beating Minerva and then her onlying being in bra and panties was a bit much, until i thought on it and maybe that her clothes were destroyed because Erza no longer cared about if she humiliated her, because she wanted to get revenge for Millianna",

One pieces thriller bark is considered one of the worst but I REALLY enjoyed it if not just bc of the oars fight being everyone vs him. Now for the rest...\n\nPower of friendship (more than glad to explain this) \n\nSound tracks (if you need explanation I'm scared for humanity)\n\nFemale characters (again no explanation is really needed if you watched the show)\n\nFan service (this one ima explain). I've heard from someone back in the day that erza and the girls are drawn that way (they specifically mentioned erza I don't remember why) for the male gaze and so are men like natsu and grey (who show a lot of skin too) bc they are the ideal male fantasy of what they want to look like while the women are what men would want to smash, and that to me is extremely stupid bc the opposite also stands true LOOK ME IN MY EYES AND TELL ME AS A WOMEN YOU DONT WANT TO LOOK LIKE ERZA... ILL END HUMANITY ITSELF IF SOMEONE ACTUALLY TRIES THAT and the men are what women want to smash so it doesn't really make sense. The only \"bad fanservice\" imo is when it's for no reason but the characters most of the times choose these outfits or can't help it *cough *cough grey",

They have a male lead with female characters but don't really stand out as much as the female chatacters in fairy tail.\n\nPacing isn't bad.

Them being female was never in your face, they had equal opportunities, moments, flaws as their male counterparts. Their past, goals were indepent of other males or their love interests, they were individuals. That's why FT ships are so good. \nNext is ofc their friendship. Especially female friendships.

The anime doesn't get into the personal arcs of the heroines seeing a lopsided view and  people rooting more for Fumino (because her personal arc was animated), and Uruka \"getting\" the ending. Another thing I like is that Nariyuki isn't viewed as \"A prize\" that the girls would fight over.

Yumeko Jabami is a transfer student who transfers to a high school where students\u2019 social status revolve around their gambling skills. \n\nMy understanding is that Yumeko isn\u2019t trying to be \u201cthe best gambler ever\u201d and she isn\u2019t \u201cout for revenge\u201d like Ryuko from Kill la Kill, she just simply LOVES the thrill of gambling. She\u2019s not trying to get rid of the gambling hierarchy, she doesn\u2019t want to succeed so she can change the system like Suzaku lol, not trying to pull her friends out of poverty. She\u2019s just a compulsive gambler who wants the chance to bet her entire life on a coin toss, whether that hurts or helps the people around her, it doesn\u2019t seem that important to her.\n\nShe makes friends, allies, and enemies along the way, and while she doesn\u2019t exactly use people like Lelouch or Ayanokoji would, she does subject them to risky situations as a result of her gambling habits. She doesn\u2019t hate anyone (except for one character later on) but she doesn\u2019t really abandon her desires or sense of self for anyone else.\n\nWhile her love for gambling could be considered a set of morals as there is a right or wrong that she develops in how she perceives handling winning and losing, I would say in her case the idea of gambling is what makes it morally grey. She becomes uncharacteristically perturbed when \u201crobbed of a fair unbiased gamble,\u201d in some scenes but the idea that her moral code is based on being subject to fair, unbiased chance (think the finger trap from season 2) makes it somewhat objective and grey in my opinion.\n\nWhat sets her apart from characters like Lelouch or Light is the idea of chance. You can take a calculated risk, but in the end, it\u2019s all based on chance. What makes her so fascinating is how enamored she becomes with the fact that she and other people who could be considered her friends could end up losing with high stakes.

The story itself is actually complex and I definitely didn't understand it the first time I watched it, plus it finished on a huge cliff hanger ending.   \n\nMy final thought about this comes from a quote I can't quite remember, but I think is taken from Heraclitus who said something along the lines of \"let me sleep until the evil in the world has passed\". That idea is very personal to me as an adult and was something the kid me who saw this anime for the first time years ago couldn't have understood.

                "Goblin Slayer.\n\nNot for the reasons you think. There are two reasons.\n\nFirst, the story is heavily rooted in early editions of D&D, with levels, multiclassing, spells per day, and the Dice Rolls of The Gods. But lacking 5E's overpowered superheros with a fantasy skin aesthetic. I play TRPGs, and these types of old-school fantasy games are my jam. Characters die in these games. A lot. I mean, when was the last time you saw a fantasy character in anime go into a cave with a torch, or any kind of light source?\n\nAnd GS is the player who shows up and murders the GM's adventure with superior planning and tactics.\n\nSecond, it's a story about surviving trauma, finding people who help heal that trauma, and coming back to something close to human. GS himself is Batman with no no-killing rule and every goblin is the Joker. This is a guy who kits himself out with junk gear because he *knows* he can die in a goblin lair and he doesn't want the goblins to have good gear. That's his level of commitment.\n\nKilling goblins is less interesting than watching him slowly, slowly, come out of his shell. Priestess begins that process. Joining a party helps that along. The true power of friendship. And without that, without having evolved past his pain the way he did, he'd have never survived the dangers he faces later in the series.",

Nanachi and Reg are my 2 favorite characters in all of fiction, Riko also makes my top 10, Bondrewed is a great villain and the show has awsome side characters aswell like Ozen and Nat.\n\nWhen people talk about this show it seems like they only see the dark aspects and the suffering but there is a lot of beauty and joy to be found aswell. Riko loves her Adventure. She found her happines. It was absolutly the right decicion fore her to dive in to the Abyss. She traided a potential long live fore this Adventure but she knows that and is satisfied with this trade and never displays regret about her choice. Even on deaths doorstep she does not want to go back. She wants ho countinue on. Even though she would not be able to survive without Reg and latter Nanachi it feels like she belongs in to the Abyss.\nAnd from Dawn of the Deep Soul onwards it seems like her love fore this Adventure...well it seems like Reg and Nanachi get in to it aswell. The entire team cherishes there Adventure. \nAnd the dark and lighter happier aspects synergize well with one another. Nanachi went through hell is still suffering becuse of it but it makes it all the more enjoyable to watch her found happines with her new friends on this Adventure. Its simply a joy to watch these 3 enjoy there Adventure.\n\nNow I dont to downplay the dark aspects of the show. Mitty faced a fate worse then death, Prushka never had the choice to dive in the Abyss or not. Made in Abyss does not pull its punches. But that is no reason to dismiss its happy joyfull aspect.

But the ending was, well, what the fuck was that?  \n - [Fractale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6E2wLUje8) - Similarly good start with a different futuristic dystopian vision, even had a mind-numbing third episode twist (like Madoka), but it really boofed the landing bad.  \n  \nOh, and let's not forget  -  \n  \n - [My Little Sister Can't Be This Cute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjOrSqeqSJA), which despite the incest-\"tastic\" potential, had a solid and interesting first season and seemed to be heading away from that bad end.  But the later season just really went the direction NO ONE wanted it to go, and I'll never forgive how they did Manami dirty.  Christ, now I feel like I need a shower to clean the ick off me all over again.   \n - [Sword Art Online](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALCLCvNJ7iY) - Despite the uncreative derivative concept, the first season was okay - the story did what it was supposed to do.  But as it went on after that, it turned into some weird Monty Haul-esque masturbatory harem fantasy.  \n  \nEDIT: Wow, reading through the rest of the replies, and NO stone is left unturned!

                "{Tower of God} - This fits the first bullet for me. I was a fan of the manhwa for years, and it was finally getting its own anime, so I was extremely excited about it. I even forced a few of my friends to watch it with me together (to get an idea, I watched the first episode 4 times to meet with their schedules). However, I noticed after the first episode and it really hit me after the second and third that they were blowing through the source material. They covered roughly 75 decently long chapters resulting in a rushed mess of content. As a result, all the specific details about the power system and character interactions were pretty much nonexistent. The icing on the cake was the fighting animation for an action anime was extremely janky as well. There's going to be a season 2 coming soon, and of course I am going to watch it, but I will be coming in with a lot lower expectations. I will only be there because I am a fan of the series, not because its a good anime.",

A predictable story is ok if the characters are interesting, ie one punch man where the title sums up every battle, but Slime just doesn\u2019t have any particularly like-able characters\n\nIn retrospect I feel the same way about Demon Slayer, had to drop it quickly because the main character was so 2D",

                "*Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie*\n\nDropped after 3 episodes. The beginning of first episode I was okay with the male lead Izumi. Was warming up to his character seeing him try avoiding bad luck like the crow poop and such. Aww :-)\n\nBut then he, the obvious bad luck magnet, stopped an old lady to take and carry her load *while on the crosswalk*. Isn't that unsafe for both him and old lady considering his bad luck? My warm feelings are cooling rapidly.\n\nThen Shikimori appears. Okay, the pretty pink girl. Izumi then says out loud she's not cute, upsetting her. Izumi silently adds that she's cool. But does he say that outloud to his upset girlfriend, who he can see is tearing up? My formerly-warm feelings for Izumi hit 0 Kelvin.\n\nThen they get to school. The pacing so far has made me impatient, I don't understand how but it did. Don't want to waste time listening to cat girl and Bakugou-look-alike saying boring stuff. Click past them. Honey girl sounds great, though, so I do watch her parts while skipping the others. Oh, Shikimori kicked a sign. Meh.\n\nSecond episode. Pacing of first 5 minutes has made me impatient again so I click through looking for Honey girl parts. Honestly don't give a hoot about the other characters' dialogues which, even when I go back to check just in case, were boring predictable stuff.\n\nThird episode, MUCH better pacing-wise. I can follow the couple and think their movie date is sweet. Alas, it's too little, too late. The call of the also-airing *Love After World Domination* beckoned me to instead go watch its much more entertaining sweet couple (Fudo and Desumi) and antics. And I very much enjoyed watching that than *Shikimori*.",

                "I love goofy weird ensemble comedies so I was so ready to get invested in Arakawa Under The Bridge but when the jokes never really moved on from 'WOW that person is SO weird WOW' and yet it was trying to act LIKE the characters were all growing closer it lost me. Especially w so many of the jokes being about Sister being a guy that wears 'womens clothing and how Crazy that is and then when you think they've gotten tired of it they introduce Amazoness who is idk 'manly looking' so they can pull all the same jokes on her (not to mention the whole village chief joke being 'isnt it so crazy and fucked up that this guy is identifying as a kappa in front of me and people are cool with it') its really obvious where the creators thought process comes from and sucks all the potential actual oddball comedy out of the setup. \n\nMore than anything I was just really loving Nino as a character and when she got barely any development the entire time despite teasing it later on it felt really disappointing, especially cause after a while I was only in it for her and Pko. Most of the characters remain total dipshits and not in an interesting way, and they didn't even do the whole thing of 'hey, the MC is also kinda weird too so he'll get used to everything being crazy' part of the setup really at all so the type of comedy never really evolved. When I got to the end of the anime adaptation that'd spent half the season building up to them going to space and they just ended the final episode without doing so I could barely even be bothered to read a paragraph summary of the ending on Reddit lmao\n\nIt's a shame as I loved the OPs for years without context and now I kind of wish it stayed that way \ud83d\udc80",

                "{Assault Lily Bouquet}. I loved how it started, but by the end I was just... confused. The pacing went way to quickly, it tried to cram like 3 seasons of development in 2 episodes, and in the last episode introduced a vital concept to the core of the story that was not telegraphed at all earlier. It's a shame, because this has probably the best Opening I have ever seen in an anime",

Macross 7 however is just so braindead dumb and repetitive that I only finished the series by sure willpower and the ability to say that I actually watched it. The entire series, every episode, is just a male singer jumping into a mech and singing to solve every fucking problem period. He's a complete pacifist and does no fighting at all. Just singing. Oh my friend/band mate got kidnapped? We can solve this with the power of song. What there's a genetically engineered superbeing threatening humanity, better hop in my mech and woo her with my song.

It started out well enough: interesting characters, all the right steps towards an interesting mystery, and a fun historical fiction setting that pitted ninjas versus pirates (and the British Navy). Just all kinds of setup and a lot of potential, only for the last few episodes to fall flat on its face so badly it retroactively ruined everything it had built up. Most character development did a U-turn, there were several plot threads that were left hanging, and a few dead characters came back for no explained reason. I've been disappointed by a lot of anime in the past but never have I ever felt so personally insulted by how badly it messed up.\n\n(Edited for grammar and redundancy, also mobile user lol)",

I found two anime that made me start checking if an anime is recommended or not.\n\nThose being: \n\n1. {Shakugan no shauna} (liked the first season, but it started getting worse with each passing season. They retconned some interesting aspects/scenes to characters to make them generic, jokes got way less funny imho, and added questionable relationships) (Iirc the manga actually did just season 1, so 2 & 3 were anime only)\n\n2. {Akaneiro Ni Somaru Saka} (The ending was so bad that it stuck in my head for months, I straight up decided not to watch anime unless I checked it\u2019s ratings and reviews) (the manga ending was so much better though)\n\nBoth of these anime I watched ~6 yrs ago, so even as an adult it was the first thing I thought of for hated anime.",

Not the worst just one of the most disappointing.\n\nOne that is just terrible is Suppose a Kid From the Last Dungeon Boonies Moved to a Starter Town.

What made trying to watch the series even worse was that it was the follow on from the original Last Exile - which I cannot praise enough.

                "Here\u2019s a new one: {Liar Liar} The first couple of episodes were really strong, but then it went downhill fast. \n\n**Spoiler-free summary:** Basically, Shinohara Hiroto, the MC, finds himself at this school where people face each other in augmented reality games to earn \u201cstars\u201d. However, he immediately accidentally beats a \u201cSeven Star\u201d classmate. However, he gets a \u201cLiar Star\u201d, allowing his lies to be very convincing and making him look like a Seven Star (even though he\u2019s not). So basically he has to lie, cheat, and otherwise fudge his way through everyone who wants to challenge him.\n\n**Here\u2019s the problem with it:** The first few episodes revolve around games which anyone could immediately understand. \u201cTry not to react\u201d, a race, etc. However, as the series goes on, the games get more convoluted, meaning the ways he wins are less clever and more \u201chey, by the way, this other thing that was never explained is also a factor, meaning he technically wins.\u201d After the first few episodes, it drops from like a 7/10 to a 4 or 5.",

                "I dropped Code Geass 2 episodes in because I hated the lead, didn't like the exposition dumping, disliked the character design, and found the way it talked about and handled the themes it engaged with rather shallow. Had one of those near instant revulsion reactions to it. What I had seen presented in those episodes felt like just edgy posturing. It's a real popular one too which is baffling to me.\n\nI wouldn't say Death Note sucks per se but it suffers from a similar fate as Twin Peaks where the first season is really good and enthralling only for a major event to happen and then the majority of the second season spins its wheels and does fuck all for awhile until the last episodes of the second season where it suddenly gets good again. Not a bad anime overall as I do think the first season and the end are good enough to overshadow the bad 2nd season but still something that is rather disappointing about the series.",

The way they jump between gruesome death and tired fanservice gags feels like the show had two separate writers working completely independently of each other. It's that bad.\n\nThen there's the lazy characterizations. Everyone is exactly who they seem to be! There is no nuance or subtlety to any character that I can recall. This makes the show extremely predictable, where character deaths are so obviously telegraphed, you can hardly believe they didn't even try to make it interesting.\n\nBut you know what *really* bugged me? The show is called Akame Ga Kill, but Akame isn't even the main character! The dumb, bland male insert protagonist is! Akame is just waifu bait, complete with sword, schoolgirl outfit and passive personality. What a waste. I would probably find all other faults tolerable if Akame was at least an ass kicking independent woman with her own personality that didn't exist to serve Insert McBlando.\n\nThis show is cheap and dumb. I have to imagine it is only popular because the target demographic simply hasn't seen enough anime to realize how shitty this is.\n\nI know this show is often recommended on this sub, so I expect salt.",

And those happen to be the episodes Urobuchi wrote, the rest was written by someone else and it fucking shows. The worst part though, is the last episode into season 2.

Its a movie cut down into 6 episodes but even then its incredibly lazy. I saw what it could have been - a Thelma and Louis/ El Cazador de la Bruja style of adventure where the two leads run away, meet various characters, see landmarks, learn about each other and perhaps even see the start of something more to their relationship. But instead it doesn't even bother even with its own premise, theres a twist at the end but it doesn't even have an impact either. It genuinely sucks, because I saw what it could have been instead of the vapid and boring waste of potential that it ended up being.\n\nOther examples include:\n\nChivalry Of A Failed Knight: I have no idea why anyone would like this one. Its cringe, super generic and non sensical. Worst thing about it is the main character - it is so annoying when the show plays the violin for him yet he is so overpowered and has a harem.\n\n\nReal Girl: The animation looks like garbage, but the characters are even worse than that. One character makes a false and dangerous accusation about the main character, and yet the anime still involves him. Some really disgusting and annoying characters.\n\n\nThe Executioner And Her Way Of Life: This one was disappointing because it felt too obligatory and yet misleading. This anime won't satisfy anyone, its Yuri and fantasy feels undercooked and yet it follows the rule book so hard right up until the ending where it basically shows us the ending it wish it could have had instead. (Cool outro animation though)\n\n\nThe Demon Girl Next Door: I thought it sucked because it wasn't funny and that the voice acting and direction was really poor. Every line of dialogue was happening so fast and at some points the screen was filled with so much junk text against its plain animation that it was just overwhelming.\n\n\nIn Search Of The Lost Future: Its literally inept at everything. Animation mistakes, sterile visuals, editing issues and stuttering make up this anime's presentation. There was one scene were a character's dress changed colour mid scene - like no one quality tested this one at all. But the story, characters, romance, and voice acting are some of the worst I have ever seen.\n\n\nI seriously could be here forever listing all the ones I think are disappointing yet alone the ones you should steer clear of.",

There were some heavy pedophilia references (even pertaining to the 3 year old) that I in my naivety did not pick up on till the end.\n\nThe final episode went straight for the kill though, by outright showing a timeskip of the oldest niece getting married to her uncle on the day she turned 18. \n\nAnd that's about when I understood that all the creepy stuff in the past episodes was literal and not just supposed to be awkward humour.",

In the end, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been more disappointed by an anime.\n\nFirst of all, >!the typical high school setting was the dictionary definition of generic. Sure, Angel Beats did it too, but the added afterlife element made it more interesting. Even now, even though I\u2019ve seen several other movies and shows after Angel Beats that depict the afterlife in some way, Angel Beats\u2019 depiction is still my favorite. Charlotte had nothing interesting to offer when it comes to the setting.!<\n\nThen there\u2019s the plot which I found lame. >!A disease that gives people superpowers but is only present during their teens? Some guy getting stalked and basically abducted? Some girl constantly stalking and filming people and basically forcing them to join her cause? Some guy getting depressed after his sister dies and time travels back to reverse it? Some guy traveling the world to get rid of all those powers just to get amnesia for whatever reason? I found absolutely nothing interesting about the plot. The way Angel Beats handled death and the afterlife however was special to me since it gave me a whole new perspective on those topics. It was also the first medium since my earlier childhood that basically managed to scar me and is still special to me three years later. Even now, nothing I watched managed to hit me as hard as Angel Beats did. Charlotte was just too bland.!<\n\nThe biggest culprit for me would be the characters because I could not stand them. Hell, I can\u2019t even remember a lot of their names. >!Yuu was an unbearable wimp, the Takamatsu clone was cringe, Nao was an annoying and abusive POS, Sarah felt like a Chinese Iwasawa knockoff, there\u2019s that bully who just had to remind me of my school life and make me enraged, among other things. Sure, Angel Beats had way more of them and the large cast seems to be one of the biggest complaints I keep hearing from the haters, but I somehow found them way more memorable despite the fact that only a handful of them got any real character development. I can also name and identify every character in Angel Beats who had a name, but I only remember a few from Charlotte.!<\n\nTell me what you want, but if I\u2019m being completely honest here, I honestly think Charlotte was wasted potential. They could\u2019ve used the resources to finish the Angel Beats VN or adapt the Angel Beats prequel manga, but guess not.\n\nJust a few others I didn\u2019t like:\n\n**Heavy Object.** You don\u2019t see a lot of anime with this kind of military stuff, but of course they had to turn it into some feminist propaganda. >!We have two male retards for leads who serve this all-female military force which degrades them which was honestly painful to watch.!<\n\n**Anohana.** I heard it was supposed to be sad, but if I\u2019m being honest, it was rage inducing. I wasn\u2019t a fan of the story and the characters weren\u2019t interesting.\n\n**Lycoris Recoil.** >!Child soldiers? Dodging gun bullets like they\u2019re nerf darts being fired by a drunkard? No thanks.!<\n\n**Is This A Zombie.** What\u2019s this feminist propaganda? >!Basically we have our male lead who gets killed by a magic girl, gets brought back to life by another magic girl, and winds up having to let a bunch of other magic girls including the ones I mentioned earlier stay at his place. And basically, most of them are absolute pieces of shit. Haruna and Seraphim are abusive pieces of shit, Sarasvati and Kyoko are creeps, Yuki is some weird simp, and Eu just exists.

                "(1)Rascal does not Dream of Bunny Girl-senpai, (2)Akudama Drive, and (3)Tomodachi Game\n\nFirst off I should say, these anime weren\u2019t made for my tastes so that\u2019s one reason why I didn\u2019t enjoy them. And second, I believe that these anime needed a longer episode count to be better in my eyes bc they all felt super face paced (still would have probably disliked the series tho) or are better consumed as their source material (manga/LN). \n\n(1) the \u201cyounger sister\u201d being incestuous with her brother was painful to watch. The best part of the series is the romance with Mai and the MC but that got backtracked for pretty much the entire anime. I get that it\u2019s a multi-story series with different girls and their adolescent syndrome issues but I feel like their could have been more balance between the two because the girls\u2019 individual story arcs were weak. I feel that if the story was just a tad more cohesive I would have been more satisfied. Sometimes the MC was cringe too. The movie however was really nice. \n\n(2) I watched this because I enjoy the dangandonpa series but I was really disappointed. The MC is likable but I felt like the story was going nowhere so the plot felt forced as it reached its conclusion. In a way, it made no sense too. Definitely moved too fast too, I really wish it was given more time to develop the plot and characters because by the end of the series, the characters all felt like strangers like from the first episode. I liked the action tho. \n\n(3) I\u2019m always so, so surprised this one is as popular as it is. If we\u2019re praising anime with crazy over-the-top reactions kakegurui or jojo are better series. There are even slice-of-anime that do the exaggerated expressions better too. But people probably didn\u2019t praise Tomodachi Game for the expressions solely but rather the intelligent MC who has the entire game figured out. Or the \u201ctwists\u201d and revenge moments. I\u2019ll get to the point and say that the MC really isn\u2019t that special, his intelligence isn\u2019t properly set up like with Classroom of the Elite for example where the the viewer is able to follow along with the MC\u2019s plan but still can\u2019t fully grasp it until the end. The plot\u2019s structure is incredibly weak along with the reason as to why they\u2019re playing the game, the reveal/gotcha! moments coming out of nowhere with 0 set up, the antagonists are nonsensical, the \u201ctrust no one\u201d schtick gets repetitive which defeats the whole purpose of continuing to watch the anime.

The fight scenes are done much better in 4c's version and I prefer the music in the movies a bit more sometimes (although 1997's Guts theme, the intro and outro song should've stayed in the movies) but the movies adding music to scenes that had no music at all just makes it better. For example when Griffith meets the princess, the music in the movies is great and makes the moment seem a bit more intimate between them. The show having no music at all for some scenes sometimes makes it feel a bit awkward. Overall both are good, 1997 is better for accuracy, the movies/memorial edition is better for thr animation  and fight scenes and stuff.",

                "Interesting case... Lucy could win if she keeps range, but if Sakura gets her, it's most likely over with one hit.",
                "I\u2019m pretty sure Sakura wins. \n\nMain reason I think is because Lucy, will eventually run out of magic and some of her summons require a lot of use\u2014while Sakura has great chakra control not needing to exude a lot for powerful attacks and has a greater supply amount reserved behind her Byakugo seal. \n\nSakura can also heal (+Lady Katsuyu)  and I think that puts her at a greater advantage.",
                "I love lucy, she\u2019s one of my favourite characters in any anime but she can\u2019t keep up with Sakura in a head to head fight.",
                "Sakura no contest even some of the higher tiers in ft excluding god tiers wouldn\u2019t even win due to her high regeneration skills and healing and let\u2019s not get started on her physical strength with her byakugo she\u2019s able to one punch multiple mini juubis into dust and this is pre Boruto Sakura so Lucy gets slaughters before she could even grab her keys\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5ebmk1qnmoeb1.jpeg?width=602&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a24aad266aa5d149d300c62d20ac6c34b2a218e2",
                "You forget that Lucy is very smart and can use her spirits pretty wisely to adapt to the opponent and her arsenal varies from brute strength through long range to using specific things like water, light, sand or wool. I think wool would be especially effective against Sakura because brute strength does nothing against the fluffiness and it blocks the movement plus she can make sandstorm or blind her with light, while wearing Capricorn's glasses herself. Gemini's diversion, it could touch Sakura and turn into her, absorbing data about her and all. She can make traps to fall into a deep hole with Virgo in this whole mess, the options are so wide. You forget how agile those spirits are in their end of story/100YQ form or how much Lucy trained to be included in the battle.\n\nI tend to defend Sakura a lot most of the time, but I gotta say I like Lucy more and she's more relevant to the story from the very beginning to the very end, when her brains shined in the last battle with Acnologia. Her abilities are also way more interesting and versatile, which, as I said, supported by her intelligence is a dangerous weapon. She might be too soft, though. I think Sakura is not as soft-hearted, which could play a role in the sparing.",
                "Sakura easily. We've seen Sakura punch though a mountain like it was nothing and Lucy's spirits have no way near that level of physical Strength.\n\nAssuming Lucy could keep enough range, she may last a bit, but I doubt she will do enough damage to keep Sakura down with using somthing like Urano Metria which has a long cast time, and Sakura is easily fast enough to close the gap when doing this.",
                "At which points in time? \n\nEarly (pre shippuden) Sakura vs early Lucy goes to Lucy, no question. Until Shippuden Sakura was literally the standard for useless women in shounen anime. Lucy started the series with several powerful spirits who could at least fight for her pretty effectively.\n\nMid series (GMG Lucy vs. Early Shippuden Sakura) I think still goes to Lucy. Lucy can summon multiple spirits at once and use her 88 Heavenly Bodies spell, and while Sakura does obtain greater strength and the ability to heal I don't think her strength feats put her even all that close to Taurus' physical strength, and without any significant jutsu at her disposal I doubt she could deal with, say, a combination attack from Aquarius and Sagittarius. It's probably the closest between the two at this point, though. Sakura's experience fighting puppet users would clue her in to see that the weakness of a Celestial Mage is the Celestial Mage themselves, and target Lucy specifically. This would give her a good chance of slipping past the other spirits and taking out Lucy.\n\nEnd series (4th Great Ninja War Sakura vs. Alvarez Invasion Lucy) is where things get a little questionable. Sakura does gain the 100 Healings Jutsu, which as we've seen with Tsunade is incredibly powerful and lets the user cheat even fatal wounds. However, we don't know how powerful it is for Sakura, as she's only had it for a short time while Tsuande's powerful version has had decades to build Chakra by the time we see it. Aside from that, though, Sakura doesn't have any real offensive threat aside from brute strength afforded by her Chakra control. Meanwhile Lucy has definitely expanded her arsenal and eliminated one of her big weaknesses. With the addition of Star Dress, Lucy can take on the characteristics of her spirits and become significantly stronger, faster, and tougher, allowing her to effectively fight Sakura as well- turning this fight into a potential 3v1 if she could double summon and use Star Dress. Lucy by this time has fought some pretty crazy enemies, even landing blows on Brandish, while the best Sakura has done was clock an unsuspecting Kaguya in a very plot-dictated moment. Lucy's varied moveset would certainly give her a victory, though the Hundred Healings would at least turn it into a battle instead of a slaughter.",
                "Lucy because of her feats in the 100 year quest.",
                "Sakura is winning",
                "Considering that the picture used is the adult Sakura from Boruto and not her useless younger self, Lucy is toast. If Lucy can catch her at a distance with a spell then she has a chance. But Sakura will completely dominate Lucy at close range. Can't believe I'm saying Sakura would dominate anyone at all, but this is Lucy and not anyone from the Narutoverse. Plus Sakura is also a medical ninja so she can heal or fortify herself if she does receive damage from Lucy.\n\n10 to 1 odds in favor of Sakura beating Lucy.",
                "didn\u2019t the mods say to start tagging posts AI if they got AI art in them?",
                "Lucy will always win in my eyes, but I also am still trying to finish up naruto overall so not really a good judge here",
                "Lucy wipes the floor with Sakura. Her abilities are much more versatile and she\u2019s smarter in combat than Sakura is. Sakura has strength and healing as her only advantages and Lucy has beaten people physically stronger than her before so it\u2019s not like that\u2019s much of an issue. \n\nBoth can summon but Lucy can summon multiple spirits giving her a number advantage as well. She\u2019s got the range and power advantage, speed should be close but Sakura doesn\u2019t scale to anyone particularly fast iirc while Lucy does so she\u2019s got a slight speed advantage too. \n\nIdk how anyone could think Sakura stands a chance unless they aren\u2019t up to date on FT",
                "Sakura is literally baby Tsunade. She would knock Lucy out in a second bc Lucy\u2018s key cast time is way too long and other than that she has no strength, no stamina, nothing.",
                "Lucy wins and it's not even close, Sakura's best feat is punching Kaguya and making her bleed, putting her at star lvl. Fairy heart Zeref had infinite power over time and space, putting him at 4d. Natsu burns through the concept of time and takes out Zeref in his base form I believe.\nObviously Lucy isn't as strong as Natsu, however, she's also not an insane amount weaker. Then there is a time skip for hundred year quest with each new enemy being stronger than acnologia, and Lucy can hang with these new enemies, so hundred year quest Lucy is also 4d at least",
                "What does 1v1 combat mean in this case, as Lucy is a Summoner by default.\n\nI will just assume she can use all her powers, in that case it would likely come down to who runs out of stamina/power first and that would be Lucy.\n\nShe would be able to deal massive damage with her Stardress combos or Urano Metria, but they sap ridiculous amounts of magic power and Sakura has basically a healing factor and her physical prowess are her main weapon, so she likely wont stay down and certainly wont run out of stamina first.",
                "Yeah im going to say it's probably Sakura",
                "As much as i love fairy tail, this one\u2019s going to sakura",
                "I hate to say but probs Sakura. She\u2019d knock out Lucy in a few punches if not just one before Lucy had the chance to summon a spirit",
                "Sakura has the advantage in melee. If Lucy can summon Leo or Taurus, it would be a close match.",
                "Lucy is my favorite but she loses this most likely.\n\nSakura is physically much stronger and faster plus better hand to hand. Then Sakura has healing jutsu. With Lucy\u2019s Star dress mix she should be able to do some damage if she keeps it ranged but she\u2019ll eventually run out of magic.\n\nLucy is still a better character overall though.",
                "Lmao. I thought it wrote \"hand to hand\" combat. \n\nAnd i was like. Tf? Of course it's Sakura Why would they even post that???",
                "Sakura wins low-mid difficulty",
                "Unless Lucy summons something like the King of Spirits i dont see her winning againts Sakura her strenght and ninjutsu specially the Byakugou-ji makes her OP. Now in looks and personality Lucy is my favorite between the two",
                "Sakura.",
                "Well a Sakura punch is beating a Lucy kick any day",
                "Hmmmmm im not too sure how power scaling translates between the two, but iirc doesnt lucy have a spell that throws fucking planets or some shit at you? If im wrong then ig it comes down to how many spirits can sakura fight, and from the general destructive force of the fairy tail world i dont think sakura stands out that much.",
                "Sakura slams...",
                "Lucy should win but if she let's Sakura hit her once it's over.",
                "What's with the AI?",
                "Sakura bodies \ud83d\udc80 she\u2019s a trained ninja who is basically a walking nuke with how strong her punches are and she can heal any damage Lucy somehow deals to her. The speed difference is huge too, all ima say is\nThe fight will start\u2026.and Sakura disappears \ud83d\udc80",
                "Sakura win she close range fighter plus her super strength",
                "Sakura is likely faster and most definitely stronger than Lucy. Some of Lucys spirits may be able to keep up with Sakuras' speed, but she one shots any spirit Lucy throws out. Even if she couldn't, if she activated the 100 healings, then she just tanks everything, walks up to Lucy, and activates One Punch Man mode. I love Lucy, but i feel like the main three characters in Naruto far outscale most, if not all, Fairy Tail characters. \n\nI say most if not all due to me not being caught up with 100-year quest shenanigans.",
                "Sakura. Hands Down. \n\nLucy is literally a Summoner type Wizard, she has some combat abilities with her Whip/\u201cLucy Kick\u201d but she\u2019s getting folded like laundry by Sakura. Sakura isn\u2019t perfect in Naruto but she can still most people\u2019s ass. It\u2019s like comparing Goku to Hercule, Hercule is a joke but he can beat YOU up. If Lucy has her spirits, that\u2019s a different story but it\u2019s ONE ON ONE, (WO)MANO A (WO)MANO. Sakura wins, in my opinion.",
                "I\u2019d give that to Sakura",
                "Sakura wins in a fight but Lucy is hotter",
                "Sakura wins because of her 100 healings she basically has 100 lives and can literally regen from being chopped into and she is much faster then Lucy",
                "Lucy simply because of hacks. Horologium, Gemini, Star Dress mix. Lucy has to many options to keep true battle long distance. Plus she has one shot spells like urano metria and gottfried. So high diff I think Lucy wins.",
                "Sakura",
                "As much as I hate Sakura, she's definitely coming out of this the winner. Sakura vs Erza would be a more interesting fight though.",
                "1v1 means No summons? Then Sakura Wind easily in one Punch. \n\nWith summons, Sakura still wins, but Not so easily.",
                "Horny Pics aside. Its Lucy. Star Dress gives her the might of her spirits and even if it didnt. Sakura isnt fast enough or mean enougj to stop Lucy from summoning a spirit. Like Sakura would actually have to sucker punch Lucy. And i dont think Sakura ever would in a friendly fight. And honestly. Im not sure 1 sucker punch would finish Lucy considering she trains with Natsu and the rest of their friends. Shes likely extra durable by this point.",
                "Sakura is near immortal and was able to speed blitz and damage Kaguya. Not even Naruto managed to actually damage her but Sakura made her way from Kakashi's susano, behind Kaguya and landed a punch that bruised her and broke her horn off. That alone is enough of a feat for her to beat Lucy",
                "I love Lucy but as much as some in the fandom may not give it and her character may not be written as best as it could be, Sakura deserves respect. I love both and while I feel Naruto has some broken characters, I feel either could pull off a win. But, and I hate to give either the L, I'm giving it to Sakura. Her strength is insane considering a certain feat she pulls off near the end of the series, her abilities can be quite broken if applied right, and she has insane senses that could help her see through a Lucy distraction.\n\nAlso, epic and badass photo for the thread. They both look so cool!",
                "Sakura maybe the subject of the \"lmao so weak\" meme. But she is still freakishly strong and fast. She could probably close the gap and deliver a devestating punch before Lucy is done summoning her spirits.",
                "This isn\u2019t even a real question, it\u2019s obviously Sakura. Lucy is useless without her keys .",
                "Sakura may have the powers to take down Lucy but not the brain, she'll probably hesitate and Lucy will take her down. \nAlso remember whenever Lucy's life is in danger her spirits comes to rescue her and she will use Urano Metoria just like she defeated Mimi.",
                "lmao I love me some fairy tail I really do. But all of naruto's main cast is absolutely scrubbing whoever you pull from there.",
                "Lucy would destroy her. Not only does fairytail characters far outscale Naruto characters. If you think someone like Obito can beat Lucy then you're trippin\n\nLucy doesn't need to grab her keys plus she can fight on her own with star dresses. Most people who try to debate these 2 don't even know that she can do that. Sakura clearly does't blitz and doesn't have feats that surpass Brandish or the CSK",
                "That depends on which Lucy we're talking about. If we're talking about Current Lucy? Then I believe she can pull the win against Sakura. Especially since she doesn't actually need to summon Spirits to form Astral Dresses anymore.\n\nEarly series Lucy? No. That would be a complete blitz. Especially since she doesn't have Astral Dresses yet.",
                "Lucy probably",
                "Lucy",
                "Horologium tanks the first surprise attack, then while Lucy\u2019s safe the rest pile out and inflict pain. However, Fairy Tail wizards never aim to kill (or even maim, really) while ninja are trained to, and nothing shy of permanent is going to keep Sakura down for long.",
                "Depends If it's close distance it's a lot similar to Erza vs Lucy that is one hit knockout, though with some distance and time I'd say lucy with a few of her spells Is strong plus there's Gemini too",
                "Sakura negative diff",
                "As a fan of both Naruto and Fairytail I can confidently say Lucy.\n\n(Only because Sakura is so often useless)",
                "This is even more one sided than erza vs Sakura. Do people not realize just how much quicker every ninja is than every wizard? Even without counting their ninjutsu or blood like tricks basically every ninja is physically stronger and faster than every wizard. These fights would be over way too fast. Lucy wouldn't have time to summon any of her keys before taking a punch to the face KOing her.",
                "Lucy stomps",
                "Lucy can't do anything without spirits lmao Sakura can destroy boulders with one punch",
                "Awful lot of Sakura stands here",
                "Lucy would destroy her. Not only does fairytail characters far outscale Naruto characters.

                "Lmao that Sakura picture\n\n\nAnyways, Lucy gets demolished. The speed gap is way too high, Sakura can continuously tank everything Lucy throws at her, but Sakura would one-shot Lucy if she landed a hit. Honestly even with the CSK this fight still goes to Sakura. It's just a bit lopsided.",
                "Lucy ez honestly, any category these two are gonna be compared in",
                "I'm sorry but realistically Lucy doesn't have a chance in hell. Lucy has her 12 zodiac, their respective star dresses and if this was to the death she can break a key to summoning the celestial king. All impressive without a doubt but now take Sakura. Not only is she a medical ninja who can heal herself, she's known to be better than Tsinade at this point. She also has the strength of 100 seal witch not only increases her already superhuman strength but she can literally quite literally come back from full blown death 100 times (or more depending on how much chakra she originally put in her seal), can move at light speeds which is as fast as 8 gates guy. By Boruto era with all this, she is stronger than Madara was himself at this point.",
                "Sakura. Lucy is one of the most incompetent characters I've ever seen.",
                "Lucy, straight up.",
                "Aside from her strength Sakura doesn't exactly have any advantage against Lucy. At most she has the Byakuggo seal but even then Lucy has far more abilities from her keys than Sakura has at her disposal. Also I'd argue that Sakura would likely run out of Chakra before Lucy runs out of magic (Lucy has gained 2nd Origin which essentially doubles her magic capacity). Taurus, arguably the weakest Celestial Spirit gives her strength comparable to Sakura, imagine that combined with a key like Loki or Capricorn.",
                "Sakura. Pretty sure she solos the verse too (idk much abt fairytale but that\u2019s my initial guess. Pls tell me if I\u2019m stupid and wrong)",
                "It depends, is Lucy allowed to have her keys? If so then I give it to lucy. If not then Sakura",

                "Lucy easily takes this",

                "These two get rescued by others a lot, but Lucy doesn\u2019t have a ton of super strong summons, maybe the whip helps, but she\u2019s likely toast, which is sad because Sakura isn\u2019t that strong but strong enough to beat her.",

And if Leo thinks she's in any danger, he will summon himself and Sakura wouldn't be able to beat him.

Not saying Star's part in the story *couldn't* have been done better but I definitely think the criticisms of it have snowballed to the point where the anime-only fans are having it built-up for them as something way worse than it actually is, and thus when the anime gets to that point (or when new manga readers reach that point in the books) I'm predicting their reactions will be more along the lines of \"Wait...that's what all the fuss was about? *That's* what was making people so mad for months to years on end?\"",

When will people finally admit that MHA's writing just isn't good and that trying to say \"anime will fix\" is basically trying to convince themselves that MHA is \"really that good\" when it's not.\n\nIt's seeing these takes that makes me think that MHA being the \"super great Shonen series\" is almost entirely due to the anime and if it didn't exist and was manga exclusive then not only would MHA be less relevant but it would get far more criticism for it's writing flaws then otherwise.",

Overt outlandish opinions on slavery being good would be much easier to dismiss.\n\nThe insidiousness of this type of propaganda is that it builds on truth and injects just the right amount of its own agenda to influence people without challenging them.

It doesn't sound sinister on the surface... except killing slavery in the US literally did require it to be drowned in rivers of blood.\n\n* The pride of living in the nation that abolished slavery is much more important than the shame of living in the nation that perpetuated it for so long.\n\nThis reframing to \"how we are now is good and right, people who want to change it are bad\" is core to establishing the conservative mindset in the next generation.",

Armin especially, he should've been in the first set with Mikasa and Eren. \n\nThe MHA collab debuted with 4 characters, all of whom were shop skins. How come AOT only got 2 shop skins for their debut?\n\n2. Bleach. Never watched it but i think all of the big 3 should get rep.\n\n3. One Piece. Obviously. But as the hype for the franchise continues to grow, I think Epic will hold out on cashing in on the collab too early. That or they'll bring it back a few times.",

Jotaro and Dio would have a built in emote where they summon their stand and do their pose. Joseph would have a pickaxe that would be his stand, hermit purple.

Usually sites that become popular start stacking up revenue streams, i.e. ads and corrupt streams with porn ads and re-directs and shit like that. It happens. The only thing I'll end up missing about 'Dao is the layout. It was easy, they didn't try to cram the whole world of animation from 198,000 different countries into one site.

AnimeDao, the site where we discovered new shows, discussed our favourite characters, and came together as a community, has been permanently shut down.\n\nAnimeDao was more than just a place to stream anime. It was a home for all of us who share a passion for Japanese animation. The forum discussions were lively and meaningful. We formed virtual friendships that endured for years. Countless memories were made while watching our favourite shows on that site.\n\nNow those video players sit dark and silent. The forums that once buzzed with activity have fallen still. Our usual watering hole has been taken from us, leaving a void in our hearts.\n\nWhile the site is gone, the memories will live on. The friendships we made endure. And our love of anime remains stronger than ever. We didn't know that our last day watching Trigun on AnimeDao would really be the last, but we can honour its memory by continuing to share this passion that brought us together.\n\nA new website may someday rise from the ashes to take AnimeDao's place. If so, we must support it, to keep the anime dream alive for future generations. But for today, we mourn. We mourn the loss of a site that brought so much joy into our lives for so many years.\n\nMy fellow anime fans, though AnimeDao is gone, our love of this art form lives on. And that shared passion will help guide us into a new dawn. Let us remember the good times and friendships we gained from AnimeDao, and honor its memory for years to come.",

It just went down at 00:00 for example, came back for a few minutes after an hour and then its down currently again. I hope its only because theyre doing maintenance work on the servers from the new flux of users after Animedao shut down. I love the speed but im gonna miss the episode countdowns every week.",

I will say towards the end the ads got worse and worse though. It was like 5-10 ads just to play the video. Hope they come back even better like they did when it went from.com to .to maybe they should just change to a .net or something",

Not many, if any at all, do that. Say you wanna binge watch something you just discovered came out some time ago, full of specials, and movies and you wanted to watch them in order. This site had original air dates so you could see it all in it's release order. Most sites separate stuff differently so you gotta go to Google or wiki to check release dates and info for all it's related content. Animedao had it all in one spot.",

Any time I open it, I won\u2019t be greeted with that front page I\u2019d grown to love but instead the shut down message. I won\u2019t be greeted by the newest anime episodes, nor can I go and scroll down the list of A-Z like I\u2019d occasionally do and just look at all the anime I\u2019d watched over the years.\n\nLooking back on it, I\u2019ve been using this website since my last year of middle school. I\u2019ve now entered college. The amount of memories it holds for me, and the amount of tough times it got me through thanks to it letting me sit down and watch anime when me and my family were too broke to afford subscriptions, will always be something I hold pretty close to my heart.\n\nIt really hurts to see you go, AnimeDao. The bookmarks I made will always serve as a reminder of the great times you gave me, even if the anime in them won\u2019t load anymore\u2026",

Just Naruto teaching Boruto how to do a jutsu. Sasuke helping Sarada with her homework. Just an adequate sequel to a coming of age story.",
            "selftext": "The Naruto series was very important to me as a child and a teen, i really mean it. Still, i really can't enjoy Boruto. Naruto reached a satisfying conclusion with him becoming the Hokage and marrying Hinata. The entire Boruto storyline, however, feels unnecessary and doesn't enhance in any way the original story. The only moments i see people actually enjoy in that anime is when original characters show up, or when Naruto or Sasuke are chilling with the kids. I really think that's where the Boruto series really shines and that's where everyone involved with it missed the mark. Most people that enjoyed Naruto grew up with it.\n\nI'm an adult now, i just wanted to see my favorite characters chill and have small talk with their old friends. Help their kids with their homework. Show them how to climb a tree. Maybe even have Sarada and Boruto have their own small adventures on this new peaceful world, only to have Naruto, Hinata, Sakura or Sasuke conforting them when a small inconvenience happen. A ghibli-esque type of thing you know? I really enjoyed that small storyline with Guy, Kakashi and Mirai, Kurenai's daughter.\n\nBut instead i got Naruto having even more problems. Sasuke doesn't even recognize his own daughter, even though he was supposed to restore the Uchiha clan. Kurama died just to progress some random storyline.\n\nWith some exceptions, Naruto never really felt accepted or loved. He had to become one of the most powerful shinobis in history to gain the respect of the village. And then he had kids of his own. People that would love him regardless of his position in society. That's the type of plot i wanted to see. Naruto's world is very unique and its characters are loved by those that grew up with it. I wish they leaned into that instead of having Sasuke coming back on time or whatever.\n\nEven thinking back on the original show, some of the most memorable moments i have on my mind aren't even related to the main plot. Like that time Naruto was playing cards alone with his clones, all sad and miserable, and his friends came to play with him. Or that time they were trying to figure out what was behind Kakashi's mask.\n\nAnyway, that's my rant. Naruto had its conclusion as a battle oriented shounen manga. There are many new shows now with top notch animation and more modern plotlines to take its place. Boruto didn't need to be another one of these. Naruto's world-building from the point of its conclusion is perfect for some alternate story telling.",

                "Boruto should never have been. The series encapsulates everything that\u2019s wrong with the entertainment industry and being so sequel-driven.\n\nWhether you loved or hated the ending of Naruto, the fact of the matter is that it was a complete story. There were no major plot holes that affected the story\u2019s resolution, all necessary character arcs were properly closed, the world building didn\u2019t need any further explaining or expanding on and most importantly, it successfully pulled off the whole point of the story which was Naruto becoming hokage.\n\nIn short, there was no more story to tell and it should\u2019ve been left at that. Boruto is like the Star Wars sequel trilogy: A cash grab which is nothing more than an unnecessary addition to the main mythos. It doesn\u2019t do anything better than the original series and the few things it does well are buoyed up by the legacy of the original series.\n\nAnd no, it wouldn\u2019t have worked as a slice of life series. Ppl don\u2019t come to the Naruto franchise for that. Yes it\u2019s nice to have slice of life moments that break up the action and serious storytelling from time to time but to make the whole series revolve around that after we just got done seeing giant demon wolves blow up mountains would be crazy.",

The game it's based on starts with \\~15 hours of standard high school romcom before the alien invasion plotline.

No, fillers do not have the same quality of writing Boruto would\u2019ve had if it was slice of life, fillers are deliberately just made to waste time, they don\u2019t put any efforts in them. \n\nI believe Boruto simply should\u2019ve been a grounded ninja story that explored the ninja world more while being a bit of slice of life. Like, explore new organisations that wants to disturb the peace for profit or the growing tech\u2019s influence in the world, stuff like that, don\u2019t double down on the worst parts of Naruto",
                "You're absolutely goddamn right. \n\nNaruto had a wonderful ending and told a really satisfying story, when I finished it and heard a sequel series was being made I was very sceptical, when I heard it wasn't even made by Kishimoto and was leaning in on the dumb \"Naruto is too busy to make time for his family\" idea, I tuned out entirely. \n\nSomething like that sounds like an actually suitable follow-up.",

He had to become one of the most powerful shinobis in history to gain the respect of the village.\n\nI have to disagree with that since by the end of Part 1 Naruto was at least well liked by the village for his efforts and only became a hero when he defeated Pain and saved Konoha.",
                "In a perfect world, they somehow sorted out Madara as the final villain but everything mostly goes the same. Then like 25-50 episodes of what is supposed to be a SOL/episodic series KIND OF like part 1 filler hell (except consistent writing and pacing) but then at the end it all comes together, they fight the Otsutsuki, that\u2019s the end. Cowboy bebop/JoJo part 4 vibes",
                "Imo, the story would have been best taking place outside konoha with a new MC not related to Naruto. New MC allows the power scaling to reset and since it takes place outside konoha, maybe a smaller village, u don't have to tackle the \"Well Naruto can just one shot the enemy\" problem that Boruto keeps dealing with. To tie it to Naruto, it could be that the MC once was saved by Naruto when they visited Konoha once as a kid and vows to be just like him. I think that story could work imo",

                "They tried that at the beginning with it just being a slice of life going over how Naruto bringing about an age of peace has vastly changed the landscape of the ninja world where kid ninjas can still be kids, with their biggest missions probably just being subduing a rampaging bear or whatever.\n\nAnd that shit got fucking COOKED. Bruv didn't get the chance to exist in peace, the hating was crazy.",

                "I honestly don't even think you believe this.",
                "I just think it never should have existed. Both the way it exists now and the way you pitch it, it's not made for the same audience, therefore it's a shit sequel. Naruto COULD have had a good sequel if they didn't pull all the bullshit they did in the war arc, but they did and they ended up writing themselves into a corner at the end of Naruto with nowhere else to go. Every single narrative decision you make PAST the events of Naruto is a horrible one that cannot be written well without undermining everything that came before it",
                "Yeah, I don't think anyone disagrees with that, or at the very least my friends and I have expressed this POV. But of course this wouldn't have been as mechanizable to children as a battle shounen would be.",
                "Agree, we deserve to see our favorites living happily, I've watched Naruto for over 12 years, I grew up with that series, and now if something happen to my favs (mainly sand trio) I dont know what will happen, but I'll get extremely sad for sure, losing Neji was already too much.",
                "Except 1) a show like that probably wouldn\u2019t do well. And 2) clearly Kishimoto doesn\u2019t want to write that story. If he did; he would.\n \nThis is the same issue with people who do re-writes or try to \u201cfix\u201d fictional media. If the author or editors wanted to do this: they would have. If there are legions of fans yelling for this, maybe it would happen. But it isn\u2019t. You as a person don\u2019t need to engage with Boruto. Even if you\u2019re the biggest Naruto fan alive no one will force you to watch Boruto. And maybe your ideas would make it better, but also maybe it would have led to it crashing and dying.\n \nYeah Naruto is a battle shounen that got weird in its last arc. And now Boruto is doubling down on the aliens and weirdness. But doesn\u2019t look like most fans want a slice of life, and no one who is making the series wants that either. So fun idea, but it\u2019s kind of just wasted breath here. Just because you recall non-fighting moments of Naruto or you think that Boruto doesn\u2019t need to fill this hole doesn\u2019t mean others agree. \n \nFrom the opposite side of the arguement slice of life anime are a dime a dozen, and I bet a good number of them feature ninja and similar things. Why should Boruto be so different from Naruto and be another slice of life anime that goes two seasons before it dies or gets serious?",
                "This is kinda what I want. Slice life with low stakes stuff.  And for a while this is what boruto was anime wise. The first 40ish episodes have a ton of slice of life stuff and it's prob some of the most hated parts of boruto even from its own Fandom for being boring. And while that does low-key annoy me it's very much understandible given naruto as an IP is first and foremost Shonen and the only reason we got a series and manga was because of the success of the movie. In anycase yeah boruto is absolutely unnecessary and if you asked me 3 Years earlier I'd be more cynical about it. But I've just kinda accepted it for what it is, it makes a ton of money for tv Tokyo and while nothing compared to do naruto it does have its own fanbase who more often than not are far more chill (twitter goons not withsranding)and there are a ton of people that still work on the IP that obviously care regardless if I think it pans out. So I wouldn't want to take it away from them But to me naruto ended at chapter 700 and my mind just compartamentalizes the two. I can get excited for the stuff I like and just keep the stuff I don't at arms length.",
                "I'll be honest, as someone who hates Boruto, I wouldn't have liked this idea either. I fully get you on this but I think I'd have been like \"seems neat\" and would've moved on.\n\nI don't think Naruto should've had a sequel at all. The story ended nicely and with only one dumb alien. We're now at like 5 dumb aliens (six with anime), cyborgs, etc.",
                "True but it also introduced the first (supposedly) universal+ Naruto character so it\u2019s fun to see power scalers struggle with that",
                "So Boruto should've been Teen Titans Go?",
                "I get the sentiment of wanting your favorite characters live in peace forever, I\u2019ve felt it too. But if the only other alternative to a sequel show is for them to do nothing at all, I don\u2019t think that sequel show should exist.

Stubborn, competitive, and mischievous he keeps having strange dreams at night of a different life where he hangs out with famous cartoon characters, and during the day hallucinates about seeing people and things that aren't really there. Unbeknownst to him he's also an empath.\n\nPit would be the friend that's very comedic, and apparently he can hear strange voices guiding him at times.\n\nShulk would be the smart guy that has premonitions at times. He's very tech savvy, compared to Sora who doesn't understand technological jargon.\n\nLucina would be the strange new girl that doesn't really get humor and is actually secretly from the future.\n\nJoker would be a good friendly foil to Sora but both would be extremely rebellious in different ways. He also has weird dreams at night where he ends up in a blue room inside of a prison cell with two small girls as his prison guards and a long nose man as the warden. He can see things that are hidden.\n\nPyra and Mythra are also empaths to a lesser extent and Mythra can predict the future.",

Tohru deserves more love\n* Way of the Househusband. THIS HAS ZERO ROMANCE. but this is how I aspire to be as a husband (especially one who didn't work for a while!)! sadly I'm a miserable cook...\n\nI personally tend to enjoy shows about other things that have compelling (not necessarily realistic) romances, though it can be hard to find shows that balance the two well\n\nbranching out into new genres is really great! if you decide you're ok with unrealistic, I'd recommend rascal does not dream of bunny girl senpai. it's true that all the ladies love the MC, but it's a very compelling romance and his relationships with all of the girls in the show are very compelling, and at times, extremely moving",

I thoroughly enjoyed watching their romance and how it progressed naturally and didn\u2019t do the usual wait a whole season to hold hands. After they first show interest in one another it\u2019s at a natural speed, they hold hands and go on dates and kiss at realistic speeds and at a natural speed are prepared to have sex for the first time. \n\nVery well done and natural relationship and great to watch. \n\nI definitely recommend the show",

For example, there's a scene where Ishigami gives advice to Maki, and that advice is correct.  The joke is that he and Shirogane aren't going to take that advice.  When we get the core of the story in season 3, it becomes clear that the reason why Kaguya and Shirogane aren't together is that they are both cowards, that even though even they know that there's a 99% chance that the other is interested, it's not 100% so they're not willing to make the first move.",

They filled Earth's primordial atmosphere with oxygen.\n\nThe term \"farting\" might be the most accurate way to describe the oxygen production by cyanobacteria, The process I'm referring to is indeed related to their metabolic activities. Cyanobacteria perform photosynthesis, a process that involves using sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose (a form of sugar) and oxygen. This oxygen is then released into the atmosphere as a byproduct of their metabolic processes.\n\nSo, in a sense, you could say that cyanobacteria \"released\" or \"produced\" oxygen as part of their natural metabolic activities during photosynthesis.

Maybe this evening? However, these to points - presented as bulleted highlights in the web page version - strike me as important.\n\n* \rTemporal perception can be quantified using critical flicker fusion (CFF).\n* High CFF indicates an ability to perceive rapid changes in the visual field.\n\nI am an old, old fart and suspect that after reading the paper I'll think that CFF is an insignificant factor in how we perceive the length of long segments of time as we age.\n\nI don't know if the view is still current, but back in the day many (most?) psychologist accounted for it by noting that if you are age 2, the previous year of your life is half your lifetime. And if you're 10 years old it is 1/10 your lifetime. At 60, it is  less than 2% of your life time.",

If all pellets hit at point blank, this translates to slightly more damage compared to the default Shotgun (108 instead of 90). The weapon also fires wide, fixed shots in a 5 x 3 grid pattern, whether or not bullet spread is enabled.\r  \n\r  \nThe weapon's main downside lies in its gradually widening shot pattern: as the user fires successive shots (such as by holding down primary fire or firing before the class cocks the weapon), the shot pattern spreads and only resets when the player stops firing, reloads, or switches to a different weapon. This makes confrontations past close range difficult, and makes successive shots a somewhat less viable strategy.\r  \n\r  \nThe Panic Attack was contributed to the Steam Workshop.",

He's dead and he was a fossil who didn't understand video games when he was alive. He was a film critic, and for me, many of the films he didn't like were ones I liked. Tastes differ, after all. Why would I trust his opinion on films, let alone his opinion on a medium he was unfamiliar with? He didn't like the things I liked.\n\nBetween the infamous game journalist Cuphead video, Polygon's struggling to play DOOM 2016 video, and the more recent conversation around IGN First's Redfall gameplay video, I don't understand why anybody cares what journalists and critics think about video games.\n\nEveryone always clamors for that \"objective\" review of a video game, but those really don't exist. The closest thing we really have to that are the videos from Digital Foundry examining ports, optimization, and game engine performance. But for things like art direction? Story? Soundtrack? Gameplay feel? There's too much in there that's subjective. The best you can do is find somebody who reviews games who has the exact same taste as you. And even then, that's not really a surefire way of knowing whether or not you'll like a game.\n\nI've gotten more good recommendations for games from game enthusiast youtubers like ThorHighHeels and Jacob Geller, than I ever have from actual self-identified game journalists/reviewers/critics like SkillUp or channels like IGN.\n\nI wish more games had demos.",

She lived her whole life thinking she was a curse or wrong for existing.\n\nSo she rejected that, started identifying as male and went out to prove herself that she deserved to exist. In other words her whole \"male identity\" was born out of opposition, she defined who she was by her desire to prove her village wrong.\n\nBut notice how even though she vehemently insisted she was a man she never gave up the clothing or the name.\n\nSo years later she proves herself as a great bounty hunter and the village accepts her. So what now, who is she? Her female identity as a child came from fear and her male identity now came from opposition, forming your identity on that isn't healthy, but, that opposition isn't there anymore.\n\nBridget, for the first time in her life, gets to decide who she is, her identity is no longer in the hands of others. And as she looks deep down she realises that her true self has been in her all along. Admitting she was a girl for the longest time meant admitting she was cursed, but with that weight lifted from her shoulders she can finally be who she's always been.\n\nCalling Bridget a man is pushing against her development as a character, saying she was a better character when her whole town hated her, rather then now where she's free and happy.",

The game was originally released on Xbox 360 back in 2011 and most recently re-released Nintendo Switch, PS4, and Windows in 2019. Police say the videos uploaded to Yoshida's YouTube account were monetized and had been collecting ad revenue. Perhaps also related, one of the videos is purported to have revealed the game's ending.\r  \n\r  \nYoshida is said to have also uploaded videos from the Steins;Gate anime adaptation as well as the Spy x Family anime, but those don't appear to be related to the charges being brought.\r  \n\r  \nAs Japan Today explains, non-monetized gameplay videos from Japanese YouTube accounts are commonplace and so far have yet to be subject to legal action, but Steins;Gate rights holder Kadokawa felt this case warranted charges because it's related to a visual novel, designed to be watched without interaction from the player. In theory, that would make any YouTube upload, particularly one containing the ending to the story, a \"far more viable substitute\" to actually buying the game.\r  \n\r  \nYoshida has since said that he \"knew it was illegal, even as I was doing it,\" and Japan's Content Overseas Distribution Promotion Organization (CODA) said in a separate statement that, \"in principle,\" any use of gameplay videos should require permission from the rights holder.",

Honestly, that game looks legitimately bad in hindsight. Everyone looks like were designed by Rob Lienfeld. It just felt tacky and pandering.

Disgusting example of this. Literally no female character has an outfit that's less revealing than a Bikini, except for the one cop and even she is clearly sexualized. Also like at least four of those look the exact same I swear to god. AND ADDING TO THAT, most male characters are covered from head to toe, some showing no skin. It's such a fucking dumb obvious example. Like - at least Chun Li had some muscle and her outfit was not too distant from other characters. The female characters in the 2011 MK look like fucking models.\n3. Actually a fighting game that sexualizes it's roster equally could be really fun!

I'm not judging per se, in most cases. I'm just confused. All I see is a cartoon in the exaggerated shape of a woman, or often girl, which is it's own weird topic. I don't get it, and it feels like more and more that I'm the one who's out of touch for not being sexually attracted to cartoons or whatever.

                "/uj We generally feel that this kind of pressure applied to vtubers is probably a useful thing that will cause a chilling effect on it.\n\nDue to idol culture the vtubers are all pretty much employees of their companies. These companies act and behave like any companies do, they care about brand image, certain things they condone or disallow ultimately result in what other businesses will work with them, and they very much give a fuck about access to business deals in the western market with the size of the viewership coming from there.\n\nWith this in mind, you can imagine a company that might not want to have their brand image be \"the company with pro-nazi performers\" or \"the company that employs pedophiles\" if they want major business deals with western companies that would absolutely not associate with any company that has these associations.\n\nActivists working in this area can and should get this into their mindset. While this subreddit has absolutely not had anything to do with the shit currently being peddled, it COULD have something to do with certain changes occurring if extremely large quantities of people realise the power they have to influence these companies by applying the right kind of pressures.\n\nAlso I agree with OP, don't generalise all Japanese people, or asians for that matter, or any people. \n\n/rj Gamers aren't people say what you want about them.",

                "this might be an enlightening read for those who are interested: https://www.vice.com/en/article/g5qbnx/japan-child-pornography-manga-anime. tw: there is a brief mention of some horrific acts committed by a serial killer and abuser of children. \n\napparently there have been several attempts at restricting the sexualization of minors in manga and anime and every time there has been enough backlash to the attempt that it was dropped entirely. it appears enough people in japan care more about \u201cfreedom of expression\u201d than they do about a child seeing a grown man read a sex comic about children. \n\ncertainly there are japanese people who are against this, but i guess not enough to turn the tides. however, the west has problems as well and we damage our youth in other ways. every country is a mixture of bad and good and it\u2019s important to remember that and acknowledge that when it comes to criticizing other countries.",
                "I totally agree with you. But you still have to recognize that anime is generally steeped in pedophilia and racism and the Loli aesthetic/subculture perpetuates pedophilic ideologies.

The sad fact of the matter is, basically all cultures are \u201cokay\u201d with things like this and we shouldn\u2019t be targeting one specific culture. Japan may be where anime originated from but the lolicon thing originated from a European country. We can\u2019t put all the blame on one place. I get it, Japan has messed up stuff but so does America. This trend of saying \u201cJapanese people are peeps\u201d definitely is racist and an anti Asian mindset but we can\u2019t ignore that culturally some of things are accepted. But instead we need to say \u201cIt\u2019s accepted in Japanese culture\u201d it\u2019s not generalizing Japanese people but not ignoring the problem within Japanese culture and society",

Yes, the Pok\u00e9mon in Legends\u2019 frame rate was abysmal, ~~but Pok\u00e9mon usually launches in November, so this is likely 21 months out.~~ While other parts were a bit lacking, most of the visuals to me were gorgeous, and the camera angles in the battles with the scenery made me feel like it was some Pok\u00e9mon samurai movie.  ~~And again, thats still with likely much over a year of development left.~~. \nLook, I understand if there is disappointment or even frustration at Gamefreak, but can they not become r/Gamingcirclejerk\u2019s EA?  \nEdit: I\u2019ve been corrected that they said early 2022, which is a cause for concern, but I personally feel that a cause for concern doesn\u2019t need to be a cause for calling it a failure. I\u2019m still excited about what I saw, and I\u2019m hopeful that they\u2019ll fix things in the next year of dev. I also understand why people wouldn\u2019t have that faith in GameFreak.

Other than that, game looks great, can't wait to get sodomised by Cynthia's Garchomp again. \n\nPersonally, I think the prequel looks much more hideous, but that's partially cuz the prequel just looks like a watered down BOTW with Pokemon models clumsily walking around. It has none of the dynamism of BOTW, where enemies would react to all sorts of shit, and fight eachother. That's clearly not there in Legends, and it sucks because the potential for an actually dynamic and moving Pokemon world is astronomical.

Problem was that everyone saw Keanu in all the marketing so it was natural to think he was a main character, so at that point it didn't make sense to make the story all about cyberpsychosis and turn him into a side character that only shows up for a short questline, so they turned a side questline about Johnny Silverhand getting into the main character's head (in which whacky hijinks and light terrorism ensue) into the main story and relegated the cyberpsychosis storyline as a side questline.\n\nSo basically in the rush to re-organize the game so that the original main storyline was turned into a side-questline and a side-questline turned into the main storyline they had to scrap a ton of features and skimp on QA testing and all of that stuff, resulting in the delays, bad launch and missing and incomplete features.

Nope!  \n\n\nBut the gameplay is pretty fun, didn't encounter any bugs as of the latest patch, and it allows for quite a lot of versatility of approach. The next patch seems to be adding vehicle combat too, which sounds promising. Plus a DLC coming, I hear.  \nWhat really got me was the writing, though. It does the cyberpunk genre solid - no matter where you come from, or what ending you pick, all you've done is scored a win for one MegaCorp or another. The game *is* rigged, the world *is* fucked, and the wheel cannot be broken, even as it shatters the very bodies of the people fueling it.  \nNo matter how fun it is to play, even if you do a non-lethal run and help as many people as possible... There's no escaping systemic, structural oppression and manipulation. The amount of detail that goes into exploring in amazing depth the philosophical and sociological consequences of such inhumane, *mechanic* systems is never shied away from. From fashion to religion, philosophy and identity, it's a game that *loves* to get the player considering the ramifications of a postcapitalist future.  \n\n\nImagine Mark Fisher doing Blade Runner, but it's a gameplay mix of Deus Ex and GTA. It's also a beautiful game. Even on lower settings, it's detailed enough to easily immerse yourself in.\n\nSome of the optional quests in the third act might have a bug or two, but other than that, my experience was pretty positive.  \n\n\nBut fuck the publishers that rushed the devs for such a release date. It hinged on hitting shelves during a pandemic, when people were stuck at home, and counted on the PS5 flying off the shelves... Which didn't happen anyway due to several resource and logistics issues.  \nEveryone lost, and none more than CDProjekt Red themselves, who lost many of the original team members due to the inhumane pressures of crunch pushed upon them.",

                "There is one thing that's lost with a black actor playing Wesker, though that also requires that the show writers were going to handle it well. He's essentially meant as a stand-in for nietsche's Ubermensch. The white man with blonde hair and peak physique is supposed to evoke themes relating to nazi germany and their search for the ultimate human specimen, even if one had to be created artifically(or through eugenics), so of course he had to be white and blonde.\n\nIt plays into the whole biological warfare theme that inspires the whole franchise of dehumanization in service of some greater good that is ultimately blind idealism and dominance through scientific progress and human exploitation. Things like Unit 731(don't read about it) and the horrible experiments they conducted in trying to create bio-weapons or sometimes just because they were fucking sickos, but also the fact that the CIA traded with them for information on the result of their experiments, are all heavily alluded to in RE.\n\nBecause fascist and nazi ideology is a theme that means race and racism is a theme and Wesker in this context serves as \"proof\" of what the men behind it sought to achieve on a bigger scale. So Wesker no longer being white ironically no longer has that critique, at least its ties to white supremacist ideology and historical eugenicism is weakened.\n\nBut again, this all depends on how political the show writers were actually willing to go, and I think you can still make sure to include the political themes of the series without Wesker being emblematic of the inherent white supremacy as \"the evil that resides in our society\". It might actually be a rare case of them saying \"we don't want to get too political let's hire a black actor\" when it's usually the other way around. It's not cut and dry however, there's a lot of nuance and details so I don't know, actually.",

Bethesda with fallout 76 and 4, Bungie with destiny 1 ( I heard destiny 2 is getting better), dark tide from Fatshark, ea with battlefield and battlefront 2, call of duty from Activision, Ubisoft games in general, and blizzard with overwatch 2 and world of warcraft. Most of their games use to be super fun and came out mostly finished, and it felt like they were somewhat improving on each installment or new IP. Nowadays these studios are releasing games half-baked, with cash shops fully fleshed out, game-breaking bugs, and fewer features from newer titles than games that came out around 6 years ago. We are getting older, but we aren\u2019t wrong for saying a lot of games are worse than they use to be.",

In GGX2 Story Mode Bridget insists a lot on being a guy after all, to the point of having Mars symbol on their hood, but they just got used to acting feminine.\n\nBut I guess I highly overestimated the criticisme, and maybe even old school Arc.

                "Native Spanish speaker, as an adult I can say, unless you live somewhere that's heavily Hispanic and your job involves dealing with the gen pop (customer service) Spanish is not a plus. I know English Spanish and have working French proficiency and limited German and Limited Japanese proficiency. It means fuck all. Might as well go full weeb. I will say however, of the whole bunch Japanese is fun. But if you know Spanish the Japanese pronunciation and pattern is actually kinda easy. However everything else is way way way harder. Gotta learn 2 separate scripts with the same meaning, but one is mainly used for foreign loan words. Then when you memorize both of these and can write them out, it's time to start learning Kanji which is the truly difficult stuff as they have multiple meanings whether they're compounded with other kanji or if they're alone and there's 2000+ of them. And now that you have a grasp on these 3 separate scripts, their sentence structure is different than the English one and it goes wild. But thems the breaks. And you never stop learning new kanji, or I guess old kanji as some of it is obscure and not used anymore to the point where many Japanese themselves won't know it. Then you realize book learning isn't gonna help you with conversations because you learnt formal Japanese and not casual. So you start having conversations in Japanese online to improve and try playing on Japanese servers in online games. Not to mention that for the professional business world Japanese has a different form mainly used in business formal circumstances which you'd use when facing your superiors and nowhere else. So if you're learning the language for work reasons, why did no one tell you this? Damn, okay, add it to the list of stuff to learn later. \n\nThere's a lot to learn but if you're down for a lot of learning and like improving and setting goals, and can find ways to converse with Japanese people and try and watch news and dramas in Japanese (don't learn Japanese from anime homie, it's not proper stuff) then you can really fuck with it. But it's certainly a time investment for sure. Well any language is, but of all the languages I know, Japanese has been the one that's taken the most effort. But hey if you're already bilingual then it's actually easier actually. The more languages you know the easier it is. So I guess fuck it, learn both. Then you can have fun quirky moments like when you realize Bread in Japanese is Pan. Because its a loan word from Portuguese, and Spanish uses the same word for bread because Latin language fuckery.

The new Japanese emperor, Hirohito, has made our own children into fighter pilots who will soon fly to Hawaii and attack Pearl Harbor. I spoke with Mr. Hirohito this morning, and he assured me that I have a very large penis. He said it was mammoth, dinosauric, and absolutely dwarfed his penis, which, he assured me, was nearly microscopic in size. My penis, he said, was most likely one of the biggest on the planet. I applaud Mr. Hirohito in his honesty. Thank you.",

This show aired 5 yeas ago, which is before a lot of anime fans even started watching anime, yet here\u2019s a meme talking about those thematically-on-the-nose cockpit designs. Even anime that were super popular for their season a year or two ago might hardly get a mention. Heck, a lot of people thought this show kind of sucked, what with it flubbing after it completed its emotional arc in episode 15 (apparently the manga fixed that by putting it at the end of the series), but a ton of people still remember it, and a lot of them, being newer anime fans, probably didn\u2019t even watch it when it aired.

                "I felt it was similar to the premise in Brave New World >!where the idea of families and even the words for familial members were seen as \"dirty\" and unspeakable. Yet, birth control and orgies were seen as normal, even with kids. There was some scene where kids were playing \"games\" in bushes and a boy ran out crying, implying some girl hurt his genitalia. The adults don't bat an eyelash. And giving natural birth is seen as uncivilized. Everyone is born of a test tube, siloed into a predetermined class, and brainwashed.!<\n\n>!With Darling in the Franxx the pairing and sexualizing of the female roles in piloting were seen as normal and acceptable for children no less. And yet, education regarding families, parenting, human sexuality, and reproduction are likewise intentionally excluded. The children are controlled and brainwashed by the adults. Yes, sex sells in anime as with anything else. But, I think there is a lot more depth to the series than some give credit to.!<",

A lot of popular shojo anime and manga likes to shows age gap relationships between teens and grown adults as a romantic thing to their young audience. \n\nI feel it is irresponsible to portray these types of relationships as a desirable thing to a young audience rather than the abusive relationships that they truly are. \n\nTheir are still romance anime that I enjoy so I\u2019m not going to say the entire genre is bad by any means. Some of the anime and manga that I once really like display some of the problematic aspects that I mentioned. I just know that as a child when watching anime I did not understand why these types of relationships were bad since the media I was consuming didn\u2019t portray them that way and that is scary to think about.",

Telling someone you love them is a relatively new concept, at least for men in the West. I've been going out of my way to tell my dad I love him for the last decade, and he still struggles to say it back. And he's *very* liberal. \n\nWatching romance anime is uncomfortable for men, which also happens to be the overwhelmingly dominant demographic for anime in the West.

Especially when the conclusion has been obviously telegraphed for the audience, so it feels a little disingenuous. I also think that the genre can limit itself solely to the falling in love stage of romance, which necessitates the reliance on the will they/won\u2019t they pressure.

I cannot tell you how many times I'm watched the entirety of a Romance anime and there's literally no payoff. \n\nSo often it's just 2 characters endlessly chasing each other without the emotional maturity to develop their relationship via confessing their feelings for multiple seasons until the show gets cancelled.\n\nI swear anime writers are absolutely terrified of writing characters that form a romantic relationship early into a series for some reason. It always has to be this thing you're teased for until the very end of the series.\n\nThere are of course a lot of spectacular romance anime, of which many were even in recent times (Fruit Basket reboot is my personal favorite piece of media of all time straight up.) but I think when compared to non-anime Romance media, anime is, on average, very lacking.",

                "I like some romances, here are the reasons I don't like many others:\n\n1. MC has this incredible perfect girl interested in them but seems completely incapable of doing anything positive or nice and trying to advance a romantic connection, girl does it all slowly but surely and guy falls into it. His main contribution is eventually not yelling \"no\" to stop the romantic progress. See below. \n\n2. Relationship progress is hindered or reversed by stupid misunderstandings that any actual human being could correct in 10 seconds by actually saying what happened instead of screaming \"you don't understand\" 10 times. \n\n2a. Someone keeps a secret that they have no reason to keep which causes huge problems that would've been solved if they'd just said something. \n\n3. MC is so awkward that any physical contact or even looking at a girl slightly undressed causes them to yell at the girl about how inappropriate they're being. \n\n4. The romance ends with a first kiss, and we see nothing of a relationship actually developing.\n\nBunny Girl Senpai avoids most of these and is pretty solid. As does that anime about quitting heroing to live in the countryside, featuring literal best girl Rit (I forget the name). The female leads are capable of handling some of their own emotions, and the male leads are capable of speaking instead of having a 30 second monologue in their head then saying nothing to the love interest and leaving. \nThere are other romances I've enjoyed. But so many are full of great waifu bait but have such bad writing that I just can't enjoy them.",

I see you Kaguya-sama). Or just holding extremely unrealistic or unhealthy relationship dynamics. \n\nSome are GREAT because they either satirize those very same aforementioned anime tropes, or actually showcase the RELATIONSHIP part of dating (Aggretsuko and Nana showcase multiple relationships over the course of the shows, Horimiya showcases the development of a relationship that starts early in the series). \n\nSome are just ok, because while falling neither too hard on either side, they play too \"safely\" with what's already available and not creating a new or fresh experience.  My Dress Up Darling and Bottom Tier Character Tomozaki falls in this category, despite ALL the praise, because when you rip away the production quality and funny moments you're left with an average and clich\u00e9d experience that you've been experiencing since as far back as Tenchi Muyo. \n\nIt has nothing to do with being single or not and more to do with production companies (this goes for the movie industry as well) are too scared to try anything new with the rom-com genre because the profit margins within the genre are already low as is.",

A lot of times most of them don\u2019t progress anywhere and constantly run in circles which can be annoying as a viewer,\nbut from a writing standpoint a lot of these shows start with a somewhat interesting feature to gain interest but then go back to being in a normal setting (guy and girl go to high school but find out they\u2019re connected in some interesting way). They\u2019ll then move forwards having random scenarios to put the characters in to see how they act and a lot of the \u201cjokes\u201d just end up being the same overused \u201cuh oh classic anime mishap and awkward moment\u201d sort of thing. The characters a lot of times also don\u2019t get much development beyond a backstory that doesn\u2019t give as much to go off of\u2026.\nAll this being said I am a big fan of a lot of these series when the author understands the cliches and tropes and is able to use something creative to make it interesting or engaging. I think Love is War is a great example of this with such an off the rails premise for the genre that it barely feels like a classic \u201chigh school romance\u201d even though it kind of checks all the boxes.

The faffing around being idiotic misunderstandings. rom-coms being the worst offender of them. When I was younger I would binge a shit ton of them too.\n\nThere are very few romance anime I enjoy.

I also just found out that I'm getting a full academic scholarship to a college across the country to study molecular biology, so I'm finally moving out of my mom's house and going somewhere where I don't know anyone and can have a fresh start.

                "I highly recommend looking into Studio Ghibli films. Their fantastical animation, storytelling, and \"timeless\" feel are very similar to classical Disney, who they also happen to be partnered with for their western distribution. Because of this similarity I would also say their films are very accommodating for anyone looking to get a taste of Japanese animation, while offering a more engaging experience that is not often found in Western animation, which are often simpler so young children can understand them better. \n\nOf their films, I personally recommend \"Princess Mononoke,\" which is their most complex and thought-provoking work (it's PG13 due to some blood/violence), but they also have a ton of other famous films I would look into and watch like \"Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind\", \"Howl's Moving Castle\", \"Castle in the Sky\", or the Oscar award winning \"Spirited Away.\"\n\nOne last thing is that there is currently a Studio Ghibli movie festival going on around America, where the films are being played in many movie theaters in the upcoming months. So if that appeals to you (and there is a nearby theater participating in the events) then I highly recommend looking into that.",
                "Congrats, that\u2019s a classic.\n\nAttack on Titan is a good move.\n\nIf you want something similar to Death Note I\u2019d also recommend Code Geass.",

                "Well, you are not wrong about the style being cheap looking because generally anime don\u2019t really have much of a budget to work with, so good animation is done out of passion and not money. This is generally applicable across all of anime, though you get some really beautiful stuff done in the 80s during the OVA boom, and 90s generally where things were hit the hardest financially during what was Japan\u2019s lost decade, but the really good shows from the 90s are generally *really* good, even if their animation can sometimes be a bit clear on their relatively tight budget\n\nAvatar is a kids show but while I haven\u2019t seen it I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s very good, and some of the most mature shows I\u2019ve seen were kids shows, some even by the same creator, Dave Filoni, who did the Star Wars Clone Wars show. \n\nFull Metal Alchemist Brotherhood is a fantastic show. Real imaginative adventure fantasy. Also very good English dub\n\nBaccano! Is widely considered a GOAT and I absolutely agree, 1929-31 america story full of gangsters and a whole lot of chaos aboard the train with the greatest name of all time, The Flying Pussyfoot, and the English dub for this show is a chef\u2019s kiss. Only problem is it isn\u2019t legally distributed anywhere in America because its license is I believe in some sort of grey space but anime viewing culture has always been happy to\u2026 skirt the law. That\u2019s how it got started in the first place\n\nTrigun is a classic 90\u2019s space western (remember what I said, passionate and fun but a little rough around the edges animation-wise). It got really big alongside Cowboy Bebop and Outlaw Star as the three Funimation space westerns in 96/97. Of those three, Bebop is the most remembered, Trigun in second, and Outlaw Star in a tragic third. Bebop is the only one that starts off with a more serious tone before it lightens up, Trigun on the other hand very much starts off goofy but it\u2019s got some real good meat once it gets going, and Outlaw Star is the most pulpy of them all and does tend to stay lighter throughout but is excellent in its own right. Trigun is just my favorite of these three. This is the original Trigun I\u2019m talking about (also great fun dub), there is also Trigun Stampede being made, it\u2019s got the first half done but I am waiting till it\u2019s done to watch. They are made to be able to be enjoyed separately as basically two telling of the same story so you can enjoy both and the original manga as three separate tellings of what is ultimately the same story and not feel like you\u2019ve been seeing the same thing multiple times, but like I said I haven\u2019t seen it.\n\nI\u2019ve also got weirder recommendations and more action stuff or whatever you\u2019d like but those three are a good selection of where to start",
                "50-ish here. For our age group I always recommend at least the first season of Initial D. Good flashbacks to 80s cars, a bit of nostalgia of growing up in that era, and a bit of seeing myself in the main character's father and boss. \n\nParasyte: The Maxim is another cerebral, yet silly, death parade. Good character development, lots of awkwardness, really good fight scenes.\n\nIf you want something in a lighter comedy, I really liked Way of the Househusband. Biopic/day in the life about a former Yakuza turned housecat that puts the same effort into taking care of his wife and home as he did becoming the most feared gangster in the city. \n\nCheck out some of the older Studio Ghibli movies for a shorter experience. HBOMax has almost all of them. I recommend Princess Mononoke, Porco Rosso, and Howl's Moving Castle. Ghibli is sometimes referred to as the Disney of Anime, to give you an idea of the vibe, though there is more gore in Mononoke than Disney would go for.",
                "Welcome into the fold. Death Note gets a lot of people interested, it's always refreshing to see older folks take interest in some of the more recently popular art forms. I agree with your nephew that Attack on Titan is a good next step. It has the same director as Death Note and the same style of melodramatic presentation, dynamic cinematography, and a plot with a mystery that comes together very satisfyingly. I hope you enjoy that. Perhaps you'd also enjoy other crime dramas like Monster and Psycho-Pass, so I'll throw those out as recommendations. \n\nAvatar the Last Airbender is indeed a kids show, but kids shows are plenty capable of being clever and engaging, so I wouldn't write it off completely on the basis of that. Besides, it's not like Death Note is a mature adult drama, it's for teenagers too (just slightly older teens than Last Airbender). I would advise against waiting for any live action adaptation, as live action adaptations of animated properties are almost always terrible. Avatar the Last Airbender has even had a live-action film adaptation previously, and it's absolutely notorious and infamously awful.\n\nIt's also refreshing to see someone your age take an interest in video games, which are the most modern storytelling medium but has largely been overlooked or written off by older folks. That being said, I have to warn you that getting any of the most modern consoles (Playstation 5, XBOX 1, or Nintendo Switch) is a hefty monetary investment, probably between 200-500 bucks depending on where you get it from and what state it's in (and that doesn't include the games, which will add an additional 40-70 bucks each). If you have a decent computer, I might recommend trying stuff on that instead. It probably wouldn't be able to handle modern Triple A titles, but relatively modern regular PC can probably handle things a few generations back provided you don't care too much about graphical fidelity (and certainly anything PS1/N64 era or earlier, and probably most indie titles), and you can buy games online from Steam and other services without committing to a console, or you can ask your nephews to teach you about emulation if you're ok with piracy. \n\nAs for actually recommending games, I suppose your nephews' recommendations will carry more weight. It might be hard to recommend games since the experience is somewhat different from other storytelling mediums. But you mentioned HBO, so maybe you've heard about The Last of Us, which recently got an acclaimed live-action adaptation on HBO, and the video game is very popular and highly regarded (though I've not played it myself), so perhaps that's worth a look. And for whatever it's worth, my own personal favorite video games have been Okami, Chrono Trigger, Fire Emblem Three Houses, Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, and Atelier Ryza. I suspect the video game subreddits will be more helpful there though. Anyway, I hope that helps, and I hope you enjoy checking more anime and video games.",
                "I watched Avatar for the first time when I was about 28. It\u2019s only \u201cfor kids\u201d in that it doesn\u2019t have extreme violence/gore, sex, or cursing. It\u2019s a pretty great story with some cute and silly moments. Never watch live action!!",
                "If you liked Death Note, then I recommend Ghost in a Shell(both the movie and the two series called 'Stand Alone Complex') and Patlabor(all of it).

The writing and world building in anime tends to be so much better than most TV shows in the US built to be milked until their popularity dies.\n\nMy first anime was in 2001, Serial Experiments Lain on TechTV.  When I saw that dark and twisted story, I realized I had never seen anything like it before.  The second anime I ever watched was Double Trouble Parallel Adventure, which was an echi mecha sci-fi.  From that moment on, I was hooked.\n\nEdit:  I tend to edge towards anime that has good writing.\n\nA Silent Voice is a great anime movie about bullying in school and teen suicide.\n\nAngel Beats, teenagers who died and cannot accept their fate find themselves stuck in limbo.\n\nDeath Parade.  A cocktail bar exists on the perapace between lives, where souls go to be judged with some classic games with high stakes.\n\nPlanetes (if you can find somewhere to watch this as it's out of production in the US):  Follows space garbage collectors who clean up space debris.  As simple as their premise sounds, the stories are amazing\n\nCowboy Bepop:  (This is an older one)  Follow bounty hunters in the far future as they travel around the solar system attempting to capture the system's most wanted.\n\nShiki: A town is slowly devoured and turned into vampires.  How will the few non-turned survive?\n\nSteins;Gate:  A man who's rejected reality and pretends to be a mad scientist accidentally invents time traveling text messages.  How will his changes to the past affect his present?\n\nFull Metal Panic: A teen boy who grew up in the battle field and is currently serving as a spec-ops mech pilot for a secret organization is tasked with protecting a normal teenage girl that doesn't know she's in danger.  Without common sense, he's expected to enroll in school and shadow her.\n\nSummertime Rendering:  The main character's step-sister has drowned and he's returned to his home island for her funeral.  Oddly, the autopsy found strangle marks on her neck, but the only other person in the water was the little girl his sister saved.  Something odd is happening in the shadows.\n\nRe:Zero:  A teenage boy suddenly finds himself in a fantasy world and gets caught up with white haired girl. (Note:  The rest of this wasn't revealed until the first episode came out, making the story a shocker.  Read at your will)  To painful surprise, he cannot die.  Instead, he reverts back to a \"checkpoint\" to try again.  Why is he stuck in this loop, and why does it feel like he'll die if he tries to tell people his ability?  Follow our hero as he endlessly loops to save the girl he loves.\n\nThat's all I can think of fo now.",

A show with a slow build up but with a massive payoff. It's about a group of friends who accidentally make a machine that sends text messages back in time which lead to far-reaching consequences. I recommend the English Dub. I'm normally a subtitle guy, but the dub was way easier to watch in my opinion.\n\nFor action, just pick up any of the popular Shonen anime and you'll be right as rain.

Probably one of the best in terms of story twists and mood changes.\n\n\"Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood\" looks like a childs anime, but boy does it get wicked fast\n\n\"Hunter X Hunter\" (2011 version) similar description as Full Metal, but under totally different circumstances \n\n\"Code Geass\" explores a morally gray protagonist \n\n\"86\" explores exploitation and war. extremely dark\n\n\"Made in Abyss\" get ready for to explore the depths of darkness with this one (both inside humans and in the world) Totally came out of left field for me too\n\n\"Fate/Zero\" and sequals/prequals\n\n\"The promised neverland\" amazing first season, second season kind of fell flat\n\n\"To your eternity\" explores loss and grief in an interesting way\n\n\"Legend of galactic heroes\" I would start with the new ones, but this is probably one of the best space/war/political intrigue animes. It also focuses heavily on personal relationships and motives of the characters. I went back and watched the original from the 80's after.\n\n\"My hero academia\"\n\n\"Assassination Classroom\"\n\n\"Overlord\" kind of fell flat in the last season, but the first couple are great\n\n\"Acendance of a bookworm\" didn't think I was going to like it but binged all seasons recently. Sure hope they bring it back\n\n\"Gundam: IronBlooded Orphans\" child soldiers and the effects war has on the poor with mechs and space battles.\n\nAll I can think of off the top of my head.\n\nAs for video games. I would suggest the \"trails\" series. Most of them are available on PC now. The sky arc through to the crossbell arc have some of the best world building I've seen.

Fullmetal Alchemist (Both the Original and the Reboot, Brotherhood), are also good options with interesting politics, world-building and some minor body-horror. It's definitely a bit goofier in tone than deathnote, but still touches on some serious and thrilling topics. \n\nFMA has many similar themes and topics to attack on titan, but I honestly prefer it and its approaches to the discussion of Racism and Genocide.

                "I'm at a list of 400 anime and Avatar the Last Airbender (despite being very arguably not an anime) easily ranks in my top 3, if not just number one, over all. Yes, it is 'for kids', but it deals with a lot of very serious topics (ptsd, genocide, etc) in mature ways. The characters all have believable flaws and feel like they aren't just caricatures. They all have normal relationships as people and grow as they experience new things. It's easily a 10/10 show and one I never watched until I was nearly 20. I loved it so much I binged the whole thing in 2 days. I've watched it several times, and there are parts that make me cry every time (I am not a person who cries easily).  \nI would love to recommend a couple of series to you from a variety of genres:  \nA Place Further than the Universe- i consider this to be the 'best' anime. It isn't my personal favorite (close, though), but I feel it does the best at doing what it sets out to do in every category. It's about a group of high school girls who undertake a journey to Antartica to find one of the girls missing mother.  \nKaiba- I'll be honest. This one is weird. Whatever you're thinking, it's weirder than that. But it's a well-done and thiught provoking series with a goofy art style that not a lot of people have heard of.  \nSweetness and Lightning- this is a series about a father and his toddler aged daughter growing closer together through cooking after the passing of his wife. This is a series that I think one can only truly appreciate after they've grown up. In fact, as someone who has been single for most of my life and who will likely never get married, much less have kids, I think there is part of the series I'll mever really be able to understand.",

                "Glad to see a new enjoyer. **One of us. One of us. One of us.**\n\nDeath Note is very good, although the latter half is notoriously divisive - some love it many hate it.\n\nAvatar is a western production but in the style of Eastern animation, and focuses on what could be categorised as martial arts.\n\nIts definitely for a young audience but it has a rather large adult following as well, as although it is very kid friendly, it also has a lot of great storytelling, character growth and wisdom to impart upon its audience. But it is filtered through the lens of a kids show so it pulls its punches quite often in regards to conflict resolution and portrayal of darker themes. Its a very good watch but dont expect anything too mature, the main characters are all kids after all.\n\nAttack On Titan is very good but is an altogether different kind of experience than Death Note. It is incredibly violent and over the top, with elements of mystery and some amazing foreshadowing in hindsight when you look back on key moments.\n\nRemember to view Anime as a medium, not a genre, though. There will be things you will gel with and things you won't. \n\nAs a rule of thumb though, avoid any and all live action adaptations of anime. They are all incredibly awful. \n\nAs a few recommendations;\n\nIf you enjoy classic Disney animations then I would highly recommend movies from a studio called Studio Gibli. They are absolutely not Anime's Disney but they share the same role as being fantastically prodicued family movies that can be both immensely wholesome and incredibly deep. \n\nIf you really enjoy stories with a lot of twists of turns, or crime/mystery, then as others have mentioned Psycho Pass is a fantastic anime about a special police task force in a dystopian future. It has a rocky beginning (first few minutes depict an unnecessarily egregious criminal to help introduce the setting but this introduction does not represent the actual focus of the story.)\n\nAnother, albeit older so with worse animation, fantastic watch is an anime called Monster, which follows a doctor who feels responsible for a patient he saved at the cost of another turning into a sick criminal and his personal quest to enact justice opon them.\n\nIf you are curious about knowing what else there is out there, I recommend looking up a site called My Anime List (aka MAL), which acts kind of like a fan-focused review site which would allow you to look up popular anime and filter then based on genres you have an interest in, in order to maybe find a few that grab your attention.\n\nAll the best, happy watching.",

He has a video for each reaction to each episode. \n\nLegend of Korra is a sequel and made for teens but is surprisingly more immature in many ways and is lackluster cause it was cut off too early by Nickelodeon.\n\nI recommend Chainsaw man, madoka magica (episode 3 is where you\u2019ll lose your head in a good way), Elfen Lied, Evangelion(kinda slow but good and also trippy), Future Diary (very fun), Anohana(bittersweet but good story and characters) and many more but I don\u2019t wanna overwhelm you lol\n\nOh and Full Metal alchemist both the original which made up its own ending compared to the original source and the brotherhood version which follows the original source material. \n\nOh and for horror: Higurashi no naku koro ni season 1 and 2.\n\nOk that\u2019s it I promise",
                "The Last Airbender is more anime-inspired than proper Japanese anime (it was made by Nickelodeon). Not every episode is a banger, but overall, its probably one of the best western cartoons of my childhood, and definitely holds up for adult audiences. The entire show is not afraid to tackle deeper, darker themes of war, trauma, etc. \n\nDear god stay away from the live action versions. Its not hyperbolic to say there's never been a good live-action adaptation of an anime. I genuinely cannot think of one. Maybe HBO manages to be the first, but I won't hold my breath, especially after the Shyamalan film. \n\nI personally wasn't a huge fan of Attack on Titan but give it a try. One I would recommend as another classic is Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood. \n\nIf you want something on par with Disney, try some of the Ghibli films. \n\nI haven't seen them myself, but the Lupin III movies are also pretty popular among older anime fans, and I've been meaning to watch them. I've only seen the original 70s anime, and while that in particular is rather dated (and suffers from being far too episodic with no overarching plot) its still entertaining.\n\nEdit: Actually I have vague memories of the Speed Racer live action movie being okay, but that's about it.",

Great story, great characters awesome fights. \n\nThe whole Gundam Series is also very good. At first glance it is just big robots fighting but it often goes really deep/dark into the topics like world wars, war crimes, child soldiers, politics.",

In the same way plenty of disney and pixar films are often enjoyed by kids but still have depth that makes many adults love them Avatar can be appreciated by anyone, and I'd say touches on more mature themes than most disney films that adults still love.",

                "Hi, kid! \n\nI was about your age when I decided to sit and actually watch an anime. And I'm not the oldest person here.\n\nI like the creativity of an anime, although every one ends up either using tropes or becoming one.\n\nWe likely have very different tastes as mine are eclectic. \n\nAvatar: not really an anime by a purist POV, but only those purist will put you down for it. Firetruck 'em. They're snobs. It's a good story. Adult enough to keep your interest, childish enough to give you laughs. Romance, battles politics, adult situations without sex, and great character back stories. A must see. Watch it with your nephew. He'll help you through some of the parts you might have trouble with.\n\nSupernatural? My faves are more humor than horror. More like the 70s sex comedies with a supernatural backdrop. But for one without, I'll recommend soul eater. If your not upset by an occasional boob shot, I'd say check out Future diaries. But you have to watch EVERY episode including the OVA, which wraps up the story perfectly.\n\nIf you're looking for a somewhat serious anime, try Kanata no Astra. 10 regular episodes sandwiched between two double length episodes. Normal episode, 23 minutes episodes 1 and 12, 46 minutes. Very faithfully adapted from the manga. Plot, high school students are sent to a planet to learn survival. Instead, as soon as their shuttle takes off, they're sucked into a wormhole and dumped into the middle of nowhere: they're plunked into outer space. Meanwhile, there just happens to be a derelict space ship. Some dramatic stuff happens and they decide to use the ship to get home. It should take them a few months to do so, but they fit have enough supplies to last that long. They plot a course to various planets to restock, then continue the journey. It turns out to be a whodunnit, as one of the kids is an attempted murderer. This anime is extremely faithful.tonthe manga source material. I actually read the manga before the anime was produced.\n\nIf you need a good laugh, anime has it for you as well. For years, my favorite anime/manga was Hinamatsuri. In a nutshell psychokinetic girl literally drops in on a Yakuza. It's the last thing he wants, but one of the gags, \"she twisted my arm,\" becomes hilarious when it's shown in context. Faithfully adapted? Even though the studio ignored a lot of the stories from the series, but what they do use is fantastic. If you read the manga, you'll find a lot of Easter eggs. Final manga is in the process of being translated and will be out on January. You'll want to read the manga once you've seen the anime.",

I know a group of Japanese adults who I wouldn't have otherwise thought to be anime fans that got really into it.\n\nAvatar: the Last Airbender might not be so recommended for an adult. Great for younger people, but I think some people recommend it mainly due to nostalgia.",
                "If you're looking for something adult and not steeped in too many stereotypical anime genre tropes, I strongly suggest Monster - it's another fantastic psychological thriller, although more grounded in reality than Death Note.\n\nThe classic anime most people recommend as an entry series is Cowboy Bebop - it's about a group of space bounty hunters, but it's really a very humane series that seamlessly knits together science fiction, action, slice-of-life, drama, and comedy, all with a fantastic bluesy soundtrack that stands on its own as great music.\n\nI will also recommend Lupin III for something with a lighter mood - whimsical 70's style heists.\n\nI would actually avoid Attack on Titan for now. It's an interesting concept, but it has its issues. \n\nIf you want some over-the-top action with heart to match its humor, I would suggest Gurren Lagann. It's certainly more youthful, but it's just plain fun with enough seriousness to grip you.",

And if you like it, Id; Invaded and B: The Beginning are also really good that share some similarities.\n\nGuardian of the Spirit (Seirei no Moribito) is another very good anime that's very well written without any cheesy or childish bits.\n\nI see Parasyte (Kiseijuu) mentioned quite a few times, but I'd actually recommend against watching that anime. Read the original manga instead if at all possible. I'm mid-40s myself, but my 17 year old son also feels the same way on that point.\n\nWhatever it is that you end up watching next, I hope that you'll really enjoy it again.",
                "Avatar and Legend of Korra are not real anime but they're quite good, even if Avatar is a bit childish at time and Korra plots a little rushed (the network imposed independent seasons)\n\nFor anime series, reminder that there are tons of styles aimed at different audiences ! It's a vast galaxy.\n\nYou can find very gore or sexual things, even encompassing things like rape or incest on one end (no exemples here), or adventure and horror (e.g. Made In Abyss), or war and racism (86) or magical girls with a twist (Magica Madoka) and cute relaxing slice of life on the other end (e.g. Yuru Camp is about girls going camping, and that's all in terms of plot).\n\nAnd in the middle, battle shounen where you need 10 episodes to conclude a fight, or shows about a specific subject that can be very mundane but heartfelt and touching, or any combination you can think of. (E.g. you like cute girls in high school but also tanks? Anime got you covered with Girls and Panzer!)\n\nMy recommendations would be to start with Shiro Bako: it's an anime about making anime, so it will enhance your appreciation of the rest (and is a good slice-of-life / working adult anime on its own)\n\nAnd you should also try some anime movies. As already answered, nearly all Studio Ghibli production is good. I'd recommend starting with the iconic Totoro, but it's very much a matter of taste. Also, as already suggested, Shinkai movies are good too, although his early ones can be quite hard to follow, I'd recommend starting with Your Name.\n\nAnd as usual, I cannot leave a recommendation post without plugging my n.1: A Place Further Than The Universe is a very well directed cute girls slice of life with a zest of adventure and a big heap of feelings added, plus great production values, plus it's an original plot!

                "I would absolutely recommend Avatar: The Last Airbender. I will be honest with you, Death Note is among the few shows out there that are actually excellent. You'll find here and there that although some may have a good or interesting plot, they might have screwed up somewhere or have too much filler or simply get boring. Most anime does that. When looking for anime, just look up \"best anime of all time\" and consume the best rated ones, because quality in this medium varies widely. Avatar: The Last Airbender tho, not an anime technically, all anime has to be Japanese plainly, but regardless, ATLA has excellent character development and a beautiful world, art style and everything. It comes from the time when people actually cared about making kids shows have a good story, and ATLA is a shining example if not the peak of that. Beautiful show, you'll love it and be hooked if you give it a chance of maybe the first few episodes to get its act together",
                "Welcome to the anime communtiy! \nThere are a lot of good recommendations in these comments, so in case youre getting choice paralysis here's a breakdown of the top 5 I caught. \n\nAttack on Titan - titanic zombies have cornered the last of humanity to live behind enormous walls. One boy wishes to break free. At any cost. This one is a very twisty and twisted thriller. \n\nVinland Saga - A historical fiction set in england and denmark during the viking era, where a boy looking for revenge for his father discovers what war and peace and life truly are. Very poignant, beautiful, and violent. \n\nCode Geass - A mind-games thriller like Death Note except set in an alternate future with giant mechs, and the protagonist's ability is to give a single command to a person he looks at that they are forced to carry out. This one's writing and scheming are even better than Death Note's. \n\nCowboy Bebop - An old classic, a jazzy bounty hunter space western that is so full of class, style, and great writing that 30 years since it came out people still recommend it. \n\nPsycho-Pass - If you liked L the most in Death Note, this one is a police thriller where we watch a new detective grapple with what is right in a future society where an AI scan of your psychological state is what makes you a criminal. \n\nHappy watching, and come back and tell us what you watch and what you think!",

The main character is very smart (like Death Note\u2019s mains) and similar to Light, he wins a supernatural power, he can make anyone obey him without dispute **only once**, then the power doesn\u2019t work anymore in that person.\n\nIt\u2019s full of \u201csmart moves\u201d, plans and etc, like death note.\n\nAttack on Titan is great, it\u2019s grim, unsettling, and has a good overall story and animation.\n\nOn the comedy tone, Spy x Family for sure.\nMaybe Konosuba as well.\n\nAnd on the drama side, I would watch for sure Violet Evergarden with its appeal on the consequences of war, with a GREAT animation.",

But the story line becomes more complex and mature as you go into the second half of the first season. - A must watch for sure. \n\nOther animes I would recommend for people to get into:\n\n- My Hero Academia\n- Jujutsu Kaisen\n- Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood (One of my all time favourites)\n\nAnime movies that I continue to rewatch to this day and would also highly recommend:\n\n- Your Name (Kimi No Nawa) - This film is insanely beautiful and the soundtrack is the icing on the cake for this film\n\n- Garden of Words\n\n- Spirited Away \n\nHope you continue to enjoy your anime journey!",

                "Avatar definitely has its focus on a younger audience but there is still a lot to like, especially beyond the first season (which is fairly mediocre before the excellent finale).\n\nThe character writing, world building and animations of season 2 and 3 really set it apart and are why it's remembered so fondly.",
                "I highly recommend Overlord. For me its the best anime of all time. I have watched and like tons of anime, but overlord is a show I can watch over and over again and it never gets old for me. Its a bit goofy but in a good way.",

                "Its so funny, i always recommend death note as the first to watch and always get a similar reaction. Im glad you jumped in. If you liked the mind game part of it and enjoy sports, give \"One Outs\" a go. I describe it as a baseball version of  Death Note. \n\nHope you enjoy attack on titan, definitely a great next watch and boy is it a brutal one that holds a masterpiece title. Agree that airbender is a more american version of anime, watched it with my 7 year old. Good story, but yea, aimed for nickelodeon. I personally never picked it up. \n\nAnother great short series is one punch man. (First season)\n12 episodes of japans greatest artists that got together for a little project that turned out hilarious and gorgeous. Worth it. I didnt bother second season because the project was not done by the same original artists. \n\nIf you want something longer, ~140 episodes, hunter x hunter. lots of kickass moments, you will get hit in your feels. \n~330 episodes with the original bleach (2000s one). Find a guide how to watch as there are \"filler\" episodes. Generally episodes that have nothing to do with the story and are generally more silly. Bleach also stops the main story in the middle, around episode 180 if i remember? It goes to a new arc, then returns to the original story at like episode 260. Both are freakin amazing, but, get a guide. Lol. \n\nRemember, theres probably more anime out there than american tv shows combined. Its easy to get overwhelmed with suggestions.",
                "If you want some excellent anime that are both sweet and tragic while being more grounded than Death Note, my three suggestions are the following:\n\nSilent Voice is a (movie)story about Shoya Ishida who in the past used to bully deaf Shouko Nishimiya for her deafness, only to end up ostracised himself for the actions he wasn't entirely responsible for on his own, who following a fateful encounter attempts to atone for his past when he meets Shouko again. \n\nJose the tiger and the Dragon is a (movie)story about an university student Tsuneo who by fate ends up meeting wheelchair bound Josee and ends up her personal assistant, following which the two grow closer as josee gets to experience life outside the confines of her grandmother's care.\n\nBeyond the Boundary is a series and a sequel movie about immortal half-youmu Akihito and crused blood possessing Mirai Kuriyama whose first encounter of Mirai trying to stab Akihito develops into a friendship, while in the background events relating to Akihito's unique status lead to a tragic turning point for the two.\n\nThese three anime have some excellent surprises for a first time viewer due to which I recommend going in blind without reading much about them, with Beyond the Boundaryquite literally turning the dynamic of the main characters on its head twice, once during the series and a second time during the sequel movie.",

A very radical radical shift in tone and audience.  If you don't already enjoy live action shows for like 8 and 9 year olds, Avatar probably won't be up your alley.\n\nAs for liking video games.  It's not impossible that you'd like it but imo you're 58, they've been popular since the late 1970s... they probably aren't for you.

                "My first anime was either YuYu Hakusho or Case Closed. Not entirely sure which one but they are both enjoyable for different reasons.",
                "Firstly,  be careful calling avatar the last air bender anime,  you will get puritans angry at you.  It is American made in the style of anime, which is generally exclusive to Japanese animation. It is a pretty great show though. It is a show made for kids,  and it does start of pretty simple,  but it is still rich enough with their writing to be a good watch for adults to be into,  especially if you enjoy character drama or world building. \n\nLive action remakes also get anime purists angry. Just like in America people get angry over remakes of old movies or shows,  and how the books were always better than the movies. Netflix especially tends to be pretty bad at making rubbish in the hopes of easy money. Come to think of it,  with all the live action Disney remakes,  this isn't even just an issue with anime anymore. \n\nAttack on titan is pretty brutal.  I would not recommend it to just anyone new to anime. It's,  well to be honest it's primarily a gore show. Yes it has naked giants,  but those naked giants eat people,  and they will make sure you see it. Not just swallowing people,  they will not into a person's body and you will see all the viscera and blood. And the characters will be hurt,  physically and emotionally. \n\nSure,  you see people die in deathnote, but attack on titan is a a lot more gruesome.  Plus plenty of other issues i have against it. It has a bunch of fictional weirdness that will be a bit rough on a nornie just getting into anime. \n\n\n\nNow for recommendation as to what you should watch if you like death note and being an adult new to anime and adverse to childish things,  i will offer you the following list:\n\nGrave of the fireflies,  a classic movie about a pair of young siblings in ww2 Japan,  completely realistic and many think it's quite sad. \n\nMonster,  a series about a doctor in Germany during (i think also ww2) with a plot akin to let's say a detective story,  hunting down a mass murderer,  very realistic, classic and popular. \n\nA silent voice,  a movie that has young main characters but handles mature themes of bullying,  disability,  depression,  guilt,  and even suicide. Kinda dark but ends up being pretty bittersweet, a more tight circle of a character drama, no action in this story though,  it's a slow burn to burn your soul. \n\nCode geass, another anime like death note with a chess based plot. A revolutionary during a war that gains a special power and uses that with his 9000+ iq to fight for the freedom of his country.  Not as good as Dearborn in my opinion but they share a lot of similarities,  oh and they have giant robots and flashy action.\n\nPsychopass, a scifi series dealing with the moral dilemma of a super computer able to determine who in society is mentally unstable enough that they may commit a crime. A bit similar to the movie minor report,  at least in a general feel\n\nOshi no ko, a series with a Kira like character,  but his side of the plot is a lot more mild and it was more anime weirdness to it. It's a great series so far,  but it's a lot of things,  the deathnote like things are just one aspect. The first episode is movie length and if you choose to watch this,  please try to watch all of the first episode\n\n\nHopefully you will find something that you will be interested in with this list.  If not,  feel free to tell me some other shows or movies you like and i will offer anime that matches a similar theme",
                ">Same nephew says I should try some video games as well (never played anything other than arcade games), so may get a PlayStation or Xbox.\n\nYou might want to consider Nintendo Switch too if you are interested in getting into video games.  Games made by Nintendo, Such as  The legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild, Mario Odyssey, and Splatoon, tend to be geared towards accessibility and intuitive design while also often being the highest quality games on the market.  Unlike Anime, there will be a bit of a learning curve with regards to video games, but they are very worth it if you can get over the hurdle of manipulating your character and the game with your controller or mouse & keyboard.\n\nOther games I might recommend to start with if you do get a PlayStation or Xbox are Minecraft (mostly for help you get comfortable with moving around in a 3d space), Limbo, Portal, Persona 5, and Uncharted.",

                "Avatar is actually pretty good even for adults. As for video games, I would recommend a PC or a PS5 for story games. Ps5 has some of the best story focused games on the market, would recommend starting with \"the last of us\" or \"uncharted\" series( if you like Indiana Jones).

I *strongly recommend* looking into the content warnings for this one, as it can deal with some sensitive topics)\n- Land of the Lustrous (fantasy, psychological drama)\n\nAnd for movies, I recommend:\n\n- Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust (supernatural action, horror. Some of the most beautiful artwork ever created for animation)\n- The Garden of Sinners (film series; supernatural mystery, drama)\n- Everything Satoshi Kon has ever made\n- Princess Mononoke (historical drama, action.

                "If you really like Death Note, it may be worth trying to read the Manga (the comics which the anime was based on). There's a bit more detail and the exact ending is a bit different so it may be something you'd appreciate if you liked the story.\n\nAttack on titan is really good (we're still waiting for the full final season to be released so just keep in mind that it's not complete unless you read the Manga - I haven't got this show so I don't know if it has been complete and I don't want to detail the conversation as the show can be controversial and I don't want you to run into spoilers).\n\nThere are a lot of other shows that are great.\n\nAvatar is geared towards kids but when a friend of mine who isn't too into anime recommended it, I pulled the trigger and was happy that I did. It's got a level of depth that is rare and they do a fantastic job of appealing to adults while being a kids show so I'd recommend giving it a try. The first season is relatively slow compared to the others so keep that in mind as you watch.\n\nThere are plenty others that have been recommended and you can't really go wrong as long as you try to keep an open mind as you watch. If something doesn't click for you, it's always okay to switch to another show on your list and see if that is better.",

Takes a little bit of a stomach to get used to, but then again you seeing Death Note, you get used to characters being killed off. If you dont enjoy the show itself, stick around for the music. Hiroyuki Sawano is a great composer for anime music. He has all of his anime works on Spotify. AoT is very drama, violence and plot heavy. Each episode you need to be engaged. Nothing silly goes on. Everything everyone does means something.\n\nI wouldnt bother with video games. But Avatar the last Airbender isnt too long an anime. Only around 65 episodes i believe. Can be watched in a 3 to 4 week span if you keeo up with it.",

And while it does lean into a more kid friendly show, Avatar (both the original and Korra) are worth a watch just for the premise, overarching story and action.",
                "Congratulations on the anime. I would suggest Cowboy Bebop.",
                "YES watch Attack on Titan. Its hard to explain how good the show is without spoiling, also because it doesn\u2019t reach that level of insanity until like halfway through. Its dark, the action and intensity are great, it has high production value with great animation and incredible music, the story is surprisingly layered. \n\nIf I had to come up with a comparison id say that when the show is firing on all cylinders it feels like Lost mixed with old Game of Thrones. Shit builds up for so long, they let the mystery and questions pile up to an almost frustrating degree, and then it turns into all out insanity when you get that release. Has some of the best twists, reveals, scenes, episodes, and stretches of episodes ive ever seen in a show in general. Like Ozymandias from Breaking Bad or Winds of Winter from GOT type episodes. Its one of those shows where you go back to the early story and have your mind blown by all the setup that was there from the very beginning now that you\u2019re seeing it from a different perspective, but this can happens like 3 times with multiple layers as you make your way through everything.\n\nNow the thing that makes recommending this show difficult is that none of this will make sense to you for a while. Its still a good show early on but follows a pretty simple setup. I would even say the show dips to its lowest right before it hits its peak. (S3P1 vs S3P2). I will also be the first to say the show is far from perfect and can struggle with pacing sometimes in the middle and towards the end. But overall it is an absolutely incredible journey with some very high highs.\n\nBasically I\u2019ll say that if you get deep into or finish Season 1 and find yourself invested in the story or mystery at all then I\u2019d say its so worth finishing.\n\n\nAlso, Avatar is most definitely a kids show but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that it is an incredible show. I watched it for the first time when I was like 20 and I loved it. The first season is pretty goofy especially early on but the story quickly develops into being extremely well written with great character development, also has some very good lessons for kids and even adults to learn.",
                "Also I cannot recommend Vinland Saga enough if you like slower paced historical fiction. Think of Vikings or The Last Kingdom as an anime but probably better. It feels very grounded and immersive (even though it still gets anime-y during some of the fights). The first season is really good but the second season that just finished recently is incredible. Theres little to no action compared to S1, its mostly just story and character development and its still some of the most beautiful television ive ever seen.",
                "Wait until you watch Attack on Titan",
                "What genres and themes do you like?\n\nAvatar is for kids, BUT it holds up extraordinarily well to the point I actually like it even more as an adult as I'm picking up on themes I didn't when I was younger. It's a minimum once per year rewatch for me. \n\nFullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is an incredibly engaging show that I also rewatch regularly and tbh is THE anime I recommend to everyone even those who have never watched anime. It's just a great show in its own regard.\n\nCowboy Bebop is a great classic too. Others mentioned Psycho Pass, this is great. Also I can't recommend enough the work of Satoshi Kon, all of his projects are EXCELLENT. Perfect Blue is a famous classic, Paprika is similar to Inception but frankly way better (there was a lot of talk Inception was inspired by it which I definitely could see but I don't think is confirmed) Paranoia Agent and Tokyo Godfathers too. One-Punch Man is really funny and silly, Mob Psycho 100 is by the same author.\n\nParasyte: The Maxim is one of my favourites of all time too. The main character is a high school student too but it's a great body horror/thriller.\n\nDorohedoro sadly only has one season but it's a great scifi/fantasy with an unusual animation style that ends up really suiting it. \n\nLastly, a really fun low stakes comedy is The Way Of The Househusband. He used to be in the Yakuza and now is... a househusband. It's chill and good for a giggle.",
                "Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood is the best, personally i didnt like Attack on Titan and avatar TLAB always felt childish in the first season, to me at least, but it really picks up after that",
                "Death note was my first anime( and it was awsm ) , I started to watch anime little late, when i spoke with some anime watching classmate, that i recently watched deathnote they were like its a overrated anime everyone knows about it , like wtf",
                "Also (third comment\u2019s the charm) you absolutely absolutely need to get caught up on video games, the medium has transformed so much over the years. \n\nIf you\u2019re looking for immersive and awe inspiring experiences with great stories Id say get a Playstation 5.\n\n-The Last of Us 1+2: considered one of the best video games ever, feels like you\u2019re playing a movie, incredible story. These games are also technical marvels that push the technology of the Playstation to their limits. Would probably be a great way to ease your way back into things as its pretty grounded, the gameplay is relatively simple, and the story is a great and easy hook. Its so good that HBO adapted it earlier this year and its now their newest premium quality hit shows. \n\n-God of War 2018: incredible fantasy adventure game where you play as the Greek God of War who has exiled himself to the realm of Norse mythology after a very dark and destructive past. Is trying to live a simpler life with his son but is dragged back into shit by the Norse Gods. Very mature and emotional story about father and son, insanely fun gameplay. The sequel Ragnarok is also great but not the instant classic the 2018 game was.\n\n-Spider-man PS4/PS5: Probably the perfect, quintessential superhero game. The story is actually very engaging and well done. Insanely fun to play, and Miles Morales even plays a big part and has his own spin-off game. The sequel comes out in like two months, just look at [how good it looks](https://youtu.be/bgqGdIoa52s)\n\n-Red Dead Redemption 2: probably the most immersive video game ever made. It is a little slow to play and get into but if you\u2019re able to slow down and smell the roses you\u2019ll have a blast. You legitimately feel like you\u2019re a cowboy, I would spend hours doing random shit like making the main character go into town to get haircuts and buy food/bullets. The story is very long but its very well done and the main character is probably one of the best and most compelling fictional characters in recent memory for me personally.\n\n-Ghost of Tsushima: If you like Samurai stuff like old Akira Kurosawa films then its a must play\n\nAll of these besides Red Dead are Playstation exclusives. And they\u2019re all recent too. I havent even thought about the stuff you missed from 10-30 years ago.\n\nYour nephew has good taste lol",

Avatar also has some of the best characters ever, and the production is insane. A lesser show would have just have people wave their limbs about and animate the elements, avatar tied each element to a martial art and this level of care shows in all other aspects of the show too. There will be moments of childish humor, or silliness like people with weapons never actually using them on anyone properly, but it is still one of the best pieces of media I've ever seen.

Anime is the overarching category for a class of shows that had hundreds of sub-genres that hopefully you'll get to explore (but maybe not the weird ones if theyre not to your taste) someday. I'd recommend checking out more \"Seinen\" anime which is more adult (death note and attack on titan are typically considered seinen)\n\nAs an adult, the only things that's changed for me is that i find more ways to appreciate anime like the sound, music, direction, and character analysis.

When are they ever as good as the animated series? \n\nAttack on Titan is amazing from a lot of respects, but it's kind of downhill the further you watch. Season 1 and maybe 2 is all I'd recommend. \n\nAlso, I think you'd agree it's unfair to compare Disney movies to Anime TV shows (and if you think Anime looks worse than Saturday morning cartoons or Looney Tunes... you've definitely not seen much - Anime is LEAGUES above average US cartoons - especially from back in the day).\n\nAnother top pick is Full Metal Alchemist:brotherhood. You have to be careful because they did the series twice and the \"brotherhood\" is the updated version with improved story and details. It definitely has weird animation at times for emotional/comedic effect, but is in every respect one of the greatest anime of all time.",

                "> One of my nephews said I should do Avatar Air Bender, but it kinda looks like it\u2019s for kids? Also, heard HBO is going to be doing live action so may wait for that.\n\n\nIf you want to know how this will go, you should try watching the excruciatingly bad live action remake that they already made, back in 2010 (directed by M. Knight Shyamalan, no less).  Last I heard, the creators of the animated show noped out of the newest attempt at a live action remake over \"creative differences\" - make of that what you will.\n\n\nThe animated show is definitely aimed at kids, but it's also really, really well done.  Definitely worth a watch.\n\n\nAs a general rule, live action adaptations of anime are terrible.\n\n\n> So I\u2019ve been told I should tackle Attack on Titan next\n\n\nJust as a heads up, it's a completely different genre than Death Note.  A lot of people tend to think of anime as a \"genre\" but it really isn't.  Death Note is a slow burn mystery / cat and mouse thriller.  Attack on Titan is an action show.\n\n\nA bit like saying \"if you liked *Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy*, you're going to **love** *Mission Impossible 4*!\"\n\n\nVery, very different shows.\n\n\nAll that said, some recommendations:\n\n\n* If you like jazz, old noir detective movies, or grungy sci-fi with a worn-down sort of aesthetic (like Blade Runner), you should 100% give *Cowboy Bebop* a shot.  It's one of the all time best anime, at least imo.  Please do not watch the live action adaptation first (or at all - seriously, spare yourself).\n\n\n* If you like mystery, cat-and-mouse thrillers like *Death Note*, maybe give *Paranoia Agent* a shot.  You might also like *Erased*.\n\n\n* If you like fantasy stuff and prefer movies over shows, you can't go wrong with pretty much anything Hayao Miyazaki directed - *Princess Mononoke*, *Howl's Moving Castle*, *My Neighbor Totoro*, *Spirited Away*... they're all great.\n\n\n* If you like gory, intense action, *Attack On Titan* and *Demon Slayer* are both great options.\n\n\n* If you like historical stuff, *Vinland Saga* just finished it's second season, and it's excellent in pretty much every way.  If you want something more centered on Japanese rather than Western history, maybe give *Samurai Champloo* a try.\n\n\n* If you like super hero stuff and comedy, you can't go wrong with the excellent *One Punch Man* - just be aware that it's a spoof of the super hero genre.\n\n\n* If you like slick sci-fi action combined with some existential, post-humanist angst, *Ghost In The Shell* might be right up your alley.  [The 1995 movie is the place to start.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_in_the_Shell_(1995_film\\))\n\n\n* If you like big robots fighting each other with a strong anti-war message, you should check out *Gundam* or *Patlabor*.  If you find you like that genre, you should later on check out *Neon Genesis Evangelion* - though I don't recommend you start with it, since it's a bit of a genre deconstruction that imo works better if you're familiar with the genre already.",
                "I really think Monster would be perfect for you. It\u2019s my favorite anime! It doesn\u2019t feel very much like anime so I think it\u2019s perfect. Also attack on titan is great. Vinland saga is amazing as well. It\u2019s a Viking action drama.",

Look up what Adult swim or Toonami used to air. Those tend to be Shonen and stay within the dame genre so it wont be too different if you liked Death Note. They're great in English generally but personally I enjoy most anime in Jap. That's just something you should try out to see your preferences.",

                "I personally love the Avatar the Last Airbender anime. Even as an adult there is enough depth to the characters and storyline to keep the show engaging. And if you like that well enough there is a sequel series with a female lead named Korra that's just as good in my opinion. The animation is also a blend of anime and Western style cartoon art, so it might be a bit more palatable to your personal tastes as well. If you are not aware, they were produced by an American animation studio and writers, though most still lump them in with foreign work. \n\nIf you are looking for more suggestions, and want more adult fare: Vampire Hunter D, and it's sequel Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust are top rated films. Though keep in mind the first one is pretty old, so the art style is kinda iffy....the story is pretty interesting and graphic though. Lol. Gundam: Iron Blooded Orphans is amazing, as well as the Gundam series \"Witch from Mercury.\" Both of these are more recent series, so the animation for them is top notch, and you do not have to have watched any of the rest to understand them, or to enjoy them. If you're looking for something a bit more light-hearted, Demon Slayer is pretty good at breaking the tension with some more light-hearted moments while still being a pretty interesting and somewhat serious story overall. As for pure fun and silliness.... Space-Dandy...hands down. It's like watching a stoner movie, but still enjoying it while fully sober. Lol. Still has an interesting plot, and characters you can't help but like. The artwork and color palate just add to the overall kinda trippy vibe.\n\nWelcome to anime, and I hope these suggestions help you to find even more stories for you to enjoy!!",

                "As someone on their 8th week of pregnancy\u2026 this is so very complicated. When i was trying to conceive i certainly felt that way\u2026 im older, and lots of thoughts of \u201ci should have been knocked up by now if i was actually fertile\u201d kept going through my head. It took 6 months\u2026 and while thats actually a normal amount of time i kept talking to girls over and over who got pregnant without even trying or only tried one month\u2026 i felt broken. \n\nOnce i got pregnant, i felt so much better. I felt like a woman again. And i know in no way is that a relief to anyone who cant for whatever reason\u2026 but I\u2019m just telling my story. I just felt so validated, not just in my womanhood but also in my age\u2026 I\u2019m 36 now and ya know trying to conceive for the first time after the age of 35 you get reminded constantly of how old you are. Im a geriatric pregnancy. \n\nYou can have people tell you this and that about how \u201cage is just a number\u201d and it doesn\u2019t mean anything if you cant conceive\u2026 but nature itself offers no such comforting words. Its cold and honest\u2026 and the truth is, society can be really wrong about a lot of things. Accepting who you are and what you can and cannot do\u2026 it hurts sometimes, but its important. You make a lot of poor decisions when you don\u2019t accept your limitations\u2026 and you wind up hurting yourself more. \n\nBut here I am now pregnant\u2026 i got lucky. But also its not without its downsides\u2026 first trimester, and counting down the days till its fucking over because ffs this sucks. Im only on reddit right now because i cant sleep because of the morning sickness that seems to kick in at around 3 in the morning every day\u2026 i feel so exhausted that even doing basic chores I get winded\u2026 \n\nOh i know its going to be worth it in the end\u2026 but from where i am right now its still a challenge to see that\u2026 hormones get to me hard too and im constantly feeling depressed and anxious and weepy. theres certainly a price to pay for that joy. So In the end, for those who cant\u2026 don\u2019t stress it. Theres always adoption. I know maybe that might not be what you were hoping for\u2026 but not having to be pregnant is not so bad. Im sure I\u2019ll have different feelings once its over\u2026 and dont get me wrong, im still very glad this has happened\u2026 but for now i cant wait for it to be over. Ugh\u2026 \n\njust one word of advice\u2026 for those trying to get pregnant, do it young, and make sure your body is as healthy as possible first. Good weight, good physical fitness. It makes a huge difference. But still no guarantees. My older sister had hers in her 20\u2019s and was in good health and fitness\u2026 she was sick as a dog from the beginning to the end. I on the other hand, am older, and more chubby, and morning sickness didn\u2019t kick in until week 6. But to be fair, she had a bit of a smoking habit, and was the kind of person who gets sick constantly\u2026 so\u2026 maybe she wasnt as healthy as she looked \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f you can get away with a lot when youre young\u2026 but getting older, and being pregnant will be more difficult if you truly aren\u2019t taking care of yourself.",

By that point in my life, I had been married for 10 years and had two kids with my wife. I'm now 2.5 years into my transition. I didn't ask that my kids change what they call me, and for a little while there was a lot of confusion from people around us when they kept calling me dad, but eventually my kids made a decision on their own without any further prompting from me or my former spouse. My kids call me Momma.\n\nI wish I had been the one to give birth to them. My ex-wife didn't want to bring kids into this world, she wanted to adopt, but she had kids with me because she knew it was something important to me. It sucks in retrospect because I realize how much my desire to have kids was a part of me crying out to be validated as a woman and projecting that on my wife.\n\nIt true that I'm not likely to ever carry kids in a womb,and that really sucks and hurts so bad it makes me cry when I see things like this. I cannot emphasize how saddening this is for me personally.\n\nBut I carried my kids for years. I rocked them to sleep, I changed their diapers, and I sang them lullabies (This was a triumph! I'm making a note here, *huge success*). \n\nBeing a parent is an important part of my life, but it isn't what validates me as a woman. My breasts don't validate me as a woman.

                "Definitely yes with regards to UM1 and especially the last fight between the slayers and Muzan. >! however, I think UM3 wouldn\u2019t be brimming with tension rather it would be more of  an emotional ride. The fight wasn\u2019t mind blowing with multiple twists and hopelessness which was very evident in Muzan fight. It had boring arts by Akaza and the usual Tanjiro-falshback-before-death!<",

                "Upper Six fight with Tengen and the boyz was the best I have seen so far, it was so emotional and everyone was fighting for survival at the end, it was the most intense battle I have seen so far, Gave me goosebumps. I don't even remember how many times I have watched S2 because of that fight",
                "Wait til sunrise countdown. If there is any scene that can give tension, it's sunrise countdown",

Again, that's just my opinion but to add some clarity to my standpoint, I knew people would prefer Tengens fight before the anime came out",
                "As a manga reader I\u2019m 110% confident it will. Pretty much all of the upper moon battles from here on out reach that hype imo",
                "Maybe with infinity castle yea but they definitely dropped the ball with this season, alot of people were expecting this episode to have a \"Never give up\" episode like season 2 and it just failed to deliver. \n\nLike for a fight it definitely gets the job done but damn it could've been better, why they didn't extend it like tanjiro vs rui and tengen vs gyutaro is beyond me",

                "i personally think the chapter when >!kokushibo is getting beheaded for the first time!< will be where the best part of the animation will go, even surpassing tengen vs gyutaro. knowing ufotable, >!akaza\u2019s getting niced, which honestly i\u2019m all for it!< and >!tanjiro\u2019s thirteenth form will go crazy!<",

I feel like ppl blame Ufotable for the comparatively boring fight sequences in SV than ED even though it\u2019s more because of the demons. Hantengu and Gyokko are ranged fighters and/or fight in peculiar manners, whereas Gyutaro is a close ranged fighter which makes it easier to animate a cool fight.

                "No. At this point, Upper moons don't scare me anymore. Upper moon 5 is trash and got soloed and Upper moon 4 was only hard to defeat because his original body is as small as a rat.\n\nAkaza defeated Rengoku and he was superior, and Gyutaro and Daki, were defeated by the skin of the teeth, by a hashira and 3 talented demon slayers in a deathbattle.",

Take a look at s3 cast and you\u2019ll see a lot more newcomers and junior staff worked on the latest arc compared to previous seasons.\n\nI\u2019m sure ufo will prioritise the bigger upcoming arcs more in the future and the people who worked on s3 will have gained excellent experience so I think it\u2019s safe to say we will get s2 levels of fight hype again soon, no problem.",
                "That one where Goku eats gyokko is pretty flamboyant",

                "In the infinity castle probably",
                "From a source material standpoint, easily. From an animation standpoint, it just depends on which staff they have available to them once these fights get adapted. If they aren't able to secure the same quality of animators/directors then there won't be another moment like this regardless of source material",

                "akaza\u2019s fight is going to bring more hype than kokushibo\u2019s i think. mainly because everyone has more history i guess with akaza, they know his character a little more so the people are definitely going to tune in a bit more",
                "I don't think so, unless they bring the exact same team that worked on this. I'm thinking as they have too many projects they no longer have the availability of their most senior guys.",
                "no and I'm even a manga reader but the manga just didn't feel as clean as the anime",

                "Yes, the Infinity Castle arc will be absolutely nuts.\n\nI personally like the Swordsmith Village Arc because UM4 was a really cool fight, imo.  But I know that they outdid themselves with the Entertainment District Arc and how flashy it was.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to follow up.  But Infinity Castle will match it, at the very least.",

                "One hundred percent. With the upcoming fights, it totally will",
                "Of course it will. Season 3 was great, and the infinity castle arc is going to be insanely packed with awesome fights. Not to mention the fight with Muzan till dawn will probably be an entire season, they might even split the infinity castle arc into two seasons aswell because of all the action.",
                "Maybe with um1 not sure ab u3",
                "Yes it will. You\u2019ll see when the last season drops",

                "Some big battles ahead",
                "Yes there will be. Unfortunately in the manga this part of the story wasn\u2019t going to have the most impactful fights.",

                "Lmao yes",
                "I would agree that the second half of episode 10 is amazing. It's hard to imagine exactly what Ufotable can and will do with the later arcs. They showed time and time again that their art style, sound design, and writing has been impeccable. I am, however, excited for UM1 fight. That fight was intense to read and I can only imagine what kind of hype and energy they are going to make.",
                "Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeessssssssssssssss",
                "Kokushibou, Akaza and Muzan fights will put anime only on their edge the entire fight lol",
                "definitely, what\u2019s coming up i\u2019ll go beyond that",
                "Yes it will. I hope that >!the last moments of the sun rising countdown will be more epic than this. Reading the manga, I was sweating and freaking nervous. Now just imagine that with the animation, music and the desperate shouts of everyone. It will be fvcking majestious. Also the upper 1 fight will be very good I think, it had the most difficult outcome of all the UM imo!<. Sorry if I spelled wrong some words, english isnt my mative language.",

                "Yes, the final saga of this show (if the animation is as good as it is now) is gonna have some of the best & most hype fights of all time.",
                "this is the best moment/battle so far. And though I don't know the manga very well, I know the basis of the final arc, and I feel Upper Moon 1 and the battle against Muzan will both exceed this one. It's the final battles the show is setting up for after all.",

                "From what I've seen of the manga, yes. And it will be glorious.",
                "tension is definitely tanjiro having to pick between saving nezuko vs saving swordsmiths and slaying hatengu. That was so stressful to watch even though i read the manga",
                "Of course, final battle arc is peak",

                "Yes it will. There are a few moments left in fights to come.",
                "I assure you it will. This season was never going to top that. It\u2019s a fine season but just lacks the huge epic moments",

                "easily",
                "I think the Infinity Castle arc will put all previous arcs to shame in terms of fight scenes and hype.",
                "bro, yes, i think a lot of people just picked up the manga, and seeing an upper moon get no diffed killed some of the hype, but the figths later on will 100% be peak. The suspens is already hitting me, and i know what happens. Rengoku and Tengens figths just had so much more emotion compared to most of the figths this season. imo",
                "I think fights in the manga certainly have to potential to match or surpass it but it's one of the best episodes of anime I've ever seen so I'm not sure it will",
                "As a manga reader, yes. The reaction to the swordsmith arc is actually pretty much the same between manga readers and the anime onlys. \nThings get crazy going forward.",

                "Yup. This fight easily Will be the Best Fight of all KnY\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q6mrfmm43h7b1.jpeg?width=648&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ad86fda2abeff6cf3b1ae252fc80230062ef821b",

                "I think Everyone >!just trying to pin down Tanjiro after Muzan is dead!< will be the hypest moment of the entire show",
                "Yes. Trust that Swordsmith Village Arc is essentially the calm before the storm\u2026getting out of Hashira training arc things jump 0-1000 real quick",
                "Honestly, it will depend on the Ufo staff that will adapt the fight lol. But if we're talking about manga tension alone, UM1 and Muzan fight will take the cake and surpass this",

                "Easily. The three fights against Akaza, Doma, and Kokushibo. Even some of the final fight against Muzan. The fight against Gyutaro wasn't even close to the best fight in the manga",
                "Yes.",
                "Yes definitely",
                "Idk I got to watch my wife, who didn\u2019t know nezuko would be able to do what she does, and the emotions her face went through was more significant than those of season 2",

                "Probably",
                "You said not to spoil too hard but here goes:\n\nBasically there is this scene where muzan's pants drop to his ankles and tanjiro- hold up wrong notes\n\nPretty much UM1 does a really sick backflip and everyone lives happily forever after because tanjiro couldn't do the backflip but Muzan taught him so now they all live peacefully (Zenitsu sucked off Inosu- wrong notes again)",

                "Yes, Hell Muichiro's fight against Gyokko was so cool in a different way. I do think only one more Hashiras will have a fight as flashy as Tengen's, but it's because of their style. If anything Kyojuro's fight had more tension because how can anything be more tense than barely beating the highest Lower Moon with a nearly broken Demon Blood Art with an insane body transformation and then suddenly having to fight Uper Moon 3?",
                "Infinity will be the best i already know",
                "This is nothing compared to what's coming on infinity castle arc",
                "The finale is going to be insane. The amount of tension and release that builds throughout it is incredible. The feeling from the amount of highs and lows happening in such rapid succession just kept me on the edge of my seat when I was reading it for the first time. Same feeling as when I read the red light district arc.",
                "Imo, S1 E19 Hinokami had peak hype",
                "I read the manga. It has moments, but none as monumental as this.",
                "When Douma BDA gets animated it will breaks the internet",
                "The story literally can\u2019t allow for that, that was the best fight and this anime and manga is carried by the fights, we are going down hill.",
                "You have one of the worst takes",
                "No, I think the next several fights will be great, some might even be much better animated like we saw with season 3, but in terms of the feeling, rage, backdrop and tension you could feel in this fight, i highly doubt it'll be topped, everything felt so interconnected, and the core group was still together with a great addition with tengen. With the remaining fights they will be greater in terms of quality of animation, stakes and techniques but I don't think it will feel as great as UM6 in what you mentioned",
                "Akaza will be the best the fight in the series. \n\nThe reason why is because (nearly) every single fight so far has had absolutely no character stakes whatsoever. By that, our heroes may as well have been trying to save people during a hurricane or earthquake. The villains are nothings, just forces of evil with no relationship to the heroes.\n\nIt doesn't help that the villains backstory is only revealed *after* the fight - an utterly perplexing choice which dampened the Gyutaro fight - can you imagine how much better it would have been if the whole way through we could directly see the parallel between the two sets of siblings? The only other fight where the villain had a relationship with the heroes is the hand demon who had been killing Urokodaki's students.\n\nThat's why I'm looking forward to the Akaza fight - *finally*, a fight where there's an actual relationship between the heroes and villains.",
                "Its decent, but dms is mosty overrated",

It\u2019s thought of as impossible. We learned to fear upper moons quickly from Akaza entrance. And here we have our bois stepping up and doing the impossible, which again hadn\u2019t been done in a century. That is why this hype can\u2019t be topped.",
                "For sure , we still have the UM1 UM2 UM3 and muzan fight etc",

                "Yes. I've read the manga and I  felt this newest season was the weakest arc in the story. I don't mean that it's a bad arc, but the Rengoku/Tengen arc was special. Personally, after reading the manga and knowing what's up, the Rengoku/Tengen arc is my absolute favorite--but I know others like some of the things that come later. And there are absolutely interesting things happening, but idk. The way Rengoku was handled was done so well, he's by far my favorite character in all of anime.",

The soundtrack for it as well was INCREDIBLE in my opinion. Crazy to think how I used to not even like that scene when I first watched it. Now it's my favorite. Gyutaro and Daki was insane as well too tho don't get me wrong. Least insane was Hantengu, but I feel like it did bring us the audience to our lowest point emotion wise >!with nezuko dying and Hantengu about to escape!< to the highest point >!Hantengu's death and Nezuko's conquering of the sun and everyone being all right!<.",

                "I have a good feeling Infinity Castle and the final fight against Muzan will be able to live up to it, certainly not in terms of Tengen blowing everything up 24/7 while fighting Gyutaro, but enough to match it imo.",
                "the reason i think this was more hype, whilst the 3rd season was definitely more beautiful, is because their opponent fought with tools, making the fight truly fast paced with the swinging of arms, moving to and fro, basically,\n\n \nSeason 1: Good and strong start, hype finale battle, hooks viewers, kamado tanjiro no uta being one of the best osts\nSeason 2: Best fights, most hype fastpaced osts overall, uzui's musical score and zenitsu's thunderclap and flash: godspeed i can't-\nSeason 3: most beautiful animation and having best feels and hype in the same song ost (i.e. sea of clouds and haze, and kamado nezuko no uta) also kizuna no kiseki's chorus has the best feeling.\n\njust my strong opinion of course;\noverall: s2>s3>s1\nfinal battle hype: s2>s1>s3\nfinal battle feels: s3>s1>s2",

The director's way off showing an intense battle is by throwing high budget rainbow vomit at the screen, and FUCK has the constant internal and actual monologuing gotten excessive.\n\nIf you looked back to season 1, stakes weren't as high and the battles weren't as large scaled but a fight didnt make me feel like i was watching a really shitty high school debate team.",

Inosuke appeared to be dead and with Uzui looking pretty much dead it looked like it was totally over. Tanjiro barely made it alive. They fought really hard in this last arc but it was obvious that they were going to win with Tanjiro being the badass he is along with Genya with his tactics.

Some of those sound effects are iconic and a big part of the show's identity. Like, I've seen people saying they should get rid of Luffy's classic stretching sound effect. Hell no!

                "Ah, this reminds me of a time back in school when I was in this gaming club, and while I wasn't an all-star smash player, I was better than anyone else in the club by a good margin. It was almost a competition to see if anyone could even take a stock off me.\n\nAnyway, this new girl comes in, and she stood out among us ^^^\u0d9e like a flower in a dumpster. She was pretty and gave no inclination that she's ever played a game in her life. There are gamer girls, yes, but she gave the physical appearance of someone that often goes clubbing and lived a rather well adjusted, middle class life.\n\nAt first, I thought she wasn't even aware of what she walked into because she was still on her phone as she sat down. The room is typically pretty noisy with everyone, but her presence was made aware, and most eyes were on her. While some only glanced, they still glanced all the same. Topics of anime ceased. Derogatory terms such as \"sweats\" and \"degenerate\" were silenced, as they didn't want to make a bad impression on this girl.\n\nAfter the quiet set I took on a guy, I started to put my controller away, because I was a bit uncomfortable with the mood of the room all of the sudden. I don't handle second hand embarrassment well, and I got a feeling that one of the club members was going to approach her and say something I'll never rinse out of my mind.\n\nJust then though, she looks up and asks if she could play a set against me.\n\n\"Heard you were better than everyone, so I wanted to try.\"\n\n I was a bit shocked, but nodded in agreement. To my surprise, she pulled out her own black game cube controller. And to an even greater surprise, she actually managed to take a couple of stocks out of me before I actually got the match on her. If she wasn't already attractive now to everyone in the room, she definitely was with how well she played Snake.\n\nShe made a bet that if I won, I would get a $100 from her in the next round. And if she won, she took me back to her place. There were some \"Oooh\" and \"Ahh\" going around in the room. I got a feeling I was being swindled though. She was probably better than me, and I was just being baited into her peer pressure trap. I had a large ego at the time, and figured I could still beat her all the same.\n\nI lost, unfortunately, and \"a bet is a bet,\" so the club chanted.\n\nAnyway, I went back to get place, and that was the first time I've ever had woman take the fattest shit on my chest. The malodorous scent was almost as bad as the body odor of the gaming club members. It was impossibly large, and made me wonder if this women ever had any fiber in her diet. The ease it came out made me think I wasn't get first victim, and nor would I be the last. That's when I vowed to never play smash brothers again.",

He pisses the king off and is demoted to bodyguard / tutor for the young royal princess.  The king hopes that Sparhawk will get offended at that and decide to quit, but instead he takes the job and does his best to train her to be the best queen she can.\n\nThe royal court is filled with her absent father (who is more interested in fucking his sister), a corrupt priest (also obsessed with fucking the king's sister), and bunches of toadies who would like to snitch on anything the princess does to the king or priest in order to curry favor.  So the only friend she has in life is Sparhawk, and she falls in love with him and decides to eventually marry him.\n\nLike I said, I loved the series as a kid.

Then one day I happened to look up his wikipedia page, and saw that in the 70's he and the wife had been convicted of child abuse, and since that was before the internet made it easy to look stuff like that up, they were able to just hide it and become famous authors.\n\n\"Write what you know\" is not always good advice.",

To make a long story short, after all her sisters die happenstance conspires to put her and Jack together in a life and death situation, and upon escaping it Jack becomes an adopted Father figure and teacher to her. That was the first half of the show, everyone loved it, lots of cute adoptive father Jack art.

I hope Netflix has learned from the past mistakes the made with other live action anime TV shows and movies.

                "YES",

                "its just a novelty, the whole live action show. Especially coming from netflix. It wont be good, we all know it wont be, it will be okay tops and thats how im gonna see it, as a fling i wont get even reserved interested into it like the witcher series just to get let down. I will watch it like a mortal combat movie.",
                "Ahh everything sounds better when voiced in japanese. Thanks netflix",

                "Netflix should be banned from purchasing the rights to ip.....they never do a good job",
                "It can't be great, it won't be as good as we want it to be as the budget simply isn't there...\nBut, it is looking like it won't be bad. It will be more than good enough to get a huge audience interested that never would have looked at it.\nPlease stop giving me hope.",
                "Only way I\u2019ll be able to watch it",
                "Going for the roots. Sub all the way.",

                "Is this irony? Hahaha",
                "Who cares?",
                "I'll watch neither first because it looks like absolute garbage and the script seems like it has been written by Marvel outcasts who think that the Guardians is the Galaxy and the newer Thor movies are well written and funny. However, if I absolutely had to, I'd watch the one with the original voice actors. Idk why anyone in their right mind would rather have the voices of those randoms instead of the OGs. Just like sub is infinitely superior to dub.\n\nGod, do I hope that this show flops. I'm pretty sure that it will, if not this season the next one will lead to its cancelation.",

                "Did u know, while it\u2019s still a bit weird, it\u2019s scientifically possible for a girl to fall in love with a non-blood related sibling? There was a study where they got 5 shirts with male sweat that consisted of relatives and non-relatives. They also got 5 females and they asked the girls which sweat smells like the most attractive they also not told what shirt belonged to who (yeah ik it\u2019s weird at least to me). Results were that the guys not related in the slightest were found the most attractive (fyi this was also like 80%-90% of the time). Reason is the sweat of a man produce\u2019s pheromones which some how females can detect and find attractive. These pheromones can also unknowingly be identified by females as relatives or not. Also to my knowledge this was not study with males smelling female sweat so that\u2019s y im specific with females smelling male sweat.\n\nSource is also from my psychology teacher so I can\u2019t find the exact source but he is my teacher and he knows his stuff so ye.\n\nSo scientifically while she herself didn\u2019t know he was a relative or not her body did just by going off of the pheromones produced from sweat which of course leads love. Tho unless ur in Alabama or live in a hentai most probably wouldn\u2019t fall in love with someone they deem a relative cause of their relationship even if their acting like family top of that it\u2019s law in most places (or so I hope).\n\nTLDR; this situation is scientifically possible tho common sense likely gets in the way regardless for most people",

Also worth noting that the manga 100% acknowledges that (circumstances aside) this was a really messed up thing to happen to a 13 year old, and it definitely gave Carol's mother some trauma that has made her a bit overprotective of Carol when it comes to men. \n\nBottom line, go read Tomo-chan Is A Girl, it's a fantastic manga and it's not about getting 13 year olds pregnant, I swear.",

            "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\n[Reddit's third-party apps are getting obliterated.](https://preview.redd.it/slp6k43eno4b1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=07cdb21cfd2ff3a3d4994987701ce46044f51bab)\n\nThanks to everyone that commented on [our previous thread asking for community feedback](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/141wtta/reddit_api_changes_subreddit_blackout_and_how_it/) on the potential blackout, both for and against it. (Not so much the person that decided to report the post to offer their opinion instead.)\n\n# What Will Happen\n\nOn [Monday June 12th at 10:00 UTC](https://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/fight?iso=20230612T10&p0=1440&msg=%2Fr%2Fanime+Blackout&font=slab) (the same time the daily thread gets posted) /r/anime **will go private for** ***at least*** **48 hours.** This means all users will be unable to see any posts on /r/anime in that time, and we're considering extending it beyond the initial two days if necessary.\n\nEpisode threads will continue to be posted by /u/AutoLovepon but will also be unavailable during the blackout period. This is to avoid flooding the sub at once when we return (and would be more work in general to do that rather than let the bot continue as usual), and there will be another sticky thread posted afterward with links to the episode threads from that period.\n\nMeanwhile, our Discord server ([https://discord.gg/r-anime](https://discord.gg/r-anime)) will stay open for the community and we will post any additional information there and on our site, [r-anime.moe](https://r-anime.moe). (Now live, may take time for the DNS cache to clear out.)\n\n# Why This Is Happening\n\nIn case you didn't read [our previous thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/141wtta/reddit_api_changes_subreddit_blackout_and_how_it/) or many of the others around the site from other subreddits already announcing their participation, [the \"Explain Like I'm Five\" version.](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/142kct8/eli5_why_are_subreddits_going_dark/)\n\nIn short, reddit's trying to close down their platform by limiting API access and there can be a variety of reasons attributed to why. They're trying to assure mod teams that our tools will have minimal disruptions, but [this post on /r/AskHistorians](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/142w159/askhistorians_and_uncertainty_surrounding_the/) shows that the admins don't have a great track record with their promises and have continued to make our work as moderators more difficult.\n\n[There was a call between admins and some developers earlier Wednesday](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/143rk5p/reddit_held_a_call_today_with_some_developers/) with the general outcome there being no willingness to change; reddit's planning on making another public post about it on /r/reddit later this week. As a partner community we were also invited to a separate call on Thursday which at least one member of our mod team is planning on attending, but at this point we don't expect that to be any different from what's been shown so far.\n\nSo, with that we invite you to join us in [taking a couple days off from reddit.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kguaGI7aZg)\n\nSincerely,\n\n/r/anime's mods [who would sorely miss Apollo et al.](https://i.imgur.com/hDDhZUP.png)",

                "There's two official volumes out.  The second just came out a few days ago. \n This scene is from volume 2.  \n\nSummary/synoposis of the story:\n\n>!A guy that likes to hunt in Japan is mauled to death by a [brown bear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ussuri_brown_bear) when he tries to save a little girl from it.  The goddess in the story needs someone to send to another world so she isekais his ass to a place where he gets attacked by wolves but is saved at the last second by a giant elf woman.  \n&nbsp;  \nGiant elf woman nurses him back to health by laying in bed with him naked (as one does).  Elves in her village think she isn't attractive because she is big and sturdy but he thinks she is pretty.  The elven elder basically forces the hero to marry her because she is a tomboy and causes a ruckus in the village and he also wants to find a partner for her since no one in the village wants her.  Since the hero thinks she is beautiful the elder jumps on the opportunity to wed her off.  \n&nbsp;  \nBefore isekaiing the hero, the goddess was reading manga/light novels and she sees that she is supposed to give him a \"cheat item\" like in the stories she is reading.  So, she gives him a magic duffel bag that can store stuff way beyond normal capacity and when the hero shoves money into it he can order stuff from an outdoor/sporting goods store, Outdoor Land in the United States, where the Goddess is currently working (this is how he buys his guns and ammunition and other things).  \n&nbsp;  \nTo repay the village for allowing him to stay there he decides to go on a trip to human lands to see how much elven goods can sell there but along the way they run into humans trying to kidnap elven women and children and they decide to try and find out who is ordering these kidnappings.  When they get to a human city, they join the hunting guild to try and get information.  \n&nbsp;  \nThe hunting guild master Buffalo ~~Bill~~ Bal admits them to the guild.  He tells them about the hunters guild and the ranking system and how to rank up. \nBasically they need to hunt mystical creatures and rank up to gain access to higher ranking missions that come from the aristocracy, who they believe is ordering the kidnappings.  \n&nbsp;  \nThrough it all, the guy explains a bunch of stuff he knows about hunting and guns, such as some of the differences in gun laws/requirements in USA vs Japan, how/why to sight a gun, etc.  He also explains why he chooses to do the things he does, such as hunting slimes using a shotgun with buckshot to get a [good spread](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9iYvyffAh4)!<",

The mist hashira >!activating the demon slayer mark!<, and tanjiro using >!thunder breathing!<.\n\nAnd these were all really short fighting moments so it didnt feel as thrilling as season 2.",

                "Swordsmith Village was always one of the weakest arcs, but the production committee really hurt it by pushing for eleven episodes. I get it, you want the money cow to keep making milk, plus it\u2019s harder to get a show on air for an irregular episode count, but it\u2019s Demon Slayer, they weren\u2019t going to shaft you for making it 9 or 10 episodes instead.\n\nI have no idea why they announced the Hashira Training arc as its own season. It was what, ten chapters in the manga? The final battle arc part one is fifty chapters, the second part is twenty.\n\nYou can fit the first part of the final arc comfortably into a 25-episode season. The first season did it with 44 chapters, and this will be almost all fights. Maybe the second part could function as a movie, since it\u2019s close in length to Mugen Train and that made all the money, but what do you do with Hashira Training arc?",

                "Swordsmith village arc was better in manga imo. But even then after I finished manga it was the arc that I least remember. Tokito's fight was boring in anime because it lacked movement. But you dont have movement in manga so It was better because you can just read as fast as you want. In manga Entertainment district arc was worse because when you have a fast and flashy scene animation quality really helps to get you into the mood. Hashira training arc will be boring in anime too because again you can just read and finish it fast in manga. The real deal is infinity castle and sunrise countdown arcs. There are a lot of fight scenes so it will be really good when it gets animated.",

Plus the last episode too.\n\nOut of place comedy was always present and boring villains. Well that depends on everyone. Some people are alredy tired of seeing a misunderstood traumatic childhood villain #435.",

                "And that\u2019s their review on a good day. Can\u2019t imagine what they would give on a bad day.",
                "I liked it more than previous season except for direction and overused cgi. Most characters of red light district area arc were fodder.  This season most character had a character arc including minor character.\n\nOnly aspect Previous season is good is in terms of ending and villan. But this season was more emotional and better story. Even though villans of this season are not likable, but they were still interesting in my opinion.\n\nAs for what u said in ur image, it a normal day of every demon slayer content ever.",
                "I can agree with most of all, yet this is a goated anime because of the animation and character design.",
                "This season was absolutely phenomenal, don't get me wrong. I still loved it and enjoyed watching. \n\nBut compared to the other two seasons , I kind of prefer them to this arc, and do feel a bit underwhelmed from some of this season's scenes.",
                "It would have been fine if the emotion demon\u2019s actually fought like a team \n\nI know it\u2019s never been too much of a strength of the demons, but the fact that they barely had any combo attacks apart from when one was really struggling makes me wonder if the author just couldn\u2019t figure out a way for the characters to survive a proper one",

                "I think this season is weaker than the previous ones but i still quite enjoyed it. It's a strong 7,5/10 for me. There were some issues but there was a lot of great stuff too",

                "IGN\u2019s reviews have become useless and weird. They score fantastic games too low, I\u2019m guessing to stand out maybe? And pretty mid games way too high. I don\u2019t bother watching them anymore",
                "I watched this in japanese with french subtitles and they translated every \"YOKATTA !\" in the last episode as being something different.\n\n It was so ridiculous i had to laugh which kinda broke the fourth wall/broke the immersion and partly ruined the final episode for me. \n\nOverall the entire season didn't feel serious/important, like i knew nothing dramatic would happen and every character would survive. I couldn't feel the danger.\n\nIt really felt like a \"filler\" season",

                "I enjoyed the season but I can\u2019t deny that overall the prior two seasons were better (to me). The finale\u2019s story implications and seeing two more hashira this season were the highlight. Oh, Haganezuka being an absolute beefcake too (shame about his eye though).",
                "Imo, this was my least favorite season. I already thought demon slayer had gotten kinda boring, but this season was just meh overall for all reasons mentioned in this meme. My main gripe was just how slow every episode felt. This was a problem from the beginning but was especially evident this season. When shit got going it was alright but still felt boring overall tbh.",

I mean I hated in the Mugen train arc, (to be honest im not a big fan of Tanjiro, the character is not relevant at all) but here we at least learned something about Muichiro and Genya and I liked it better then moving on two line and we arrived nowhere at the end of the episode. Literally there was an episode where they were just running and Muichiro was just in the vase, and then something was coming out (Tanjiro Blood demon art swords and then end the episode. Fuck man.) No doubt Entertainment District arc was the best till now. Tengen is an interesting character and such a badass. His fighting style is the best for me with the bombs and those swords. He is a maniac. I am really interested about Giyu, and Sanemi but that's it. Fights were so easy, every Kizuki gave them hard time. Now upper rank 5 and 4 was like nothing. I understand they become more powerful, but the enemies is more powerful also, so I accepted at least that much struggling than the previous arcs. What was that with Muichiro and Gyokko? Some dick measuring and then Gyokko evolved, dead. I hope the next season will be more interesting.",
                "I read the manga,its mid,its like very average.If the animation didnt look this spectacular it would have flopped,but someone had a dream to make it work and it did,the manga would have never been so popular if it werent for the spectacular job ufotable did.",

                "In all honesty this arc was like a 6 or 7/10 even in the Manga. It ends with a core plot point with Nezuko that leads to first the Hashira training arc (cause you\u2019ve got to be prepared for the final fight and introduce the last 3 Hashira properly. Pretty much the Sam ranking but maybe lower since it\u2019s just a training arc.) and final the Infinity castle arc (this is pretty much 90% fighting that\u2019ll look insane animated).\n\nDo note I don\u2019t mean it\u2019s a bad arc, it\u2019s just not as good as the others so is scaled as such.

Having the chapters switch from genjutsu to taijutsu to ninjutsu with info dumps I between shows how much sasuke has grown and how well he stacks up against itachi in all combat departments. Kirin could have ended it and take the whole story in a different direction and it would still make sense. Yea it's probably one of the top fights in the series.",

Sure his Tsukuyomi was impressive when it was used on Kakashi and I liked seeing him onscreen well enough.\n\nBut this? This put him firmly above a few other characters in my mind. Easily one of the coolest scenes in the anime for me. The idea that Itachi can combat an opponent by simply sitting there really put into perspective how Genjutsu can be used to its fullest effect. Absolutely loved it.",

I was so hyped when Sasuke could finally fight him, it was like the match of the century along Naruto vs Pain.\n\nAll the technique clash was top: the spinning blows, the shuriken, the genjutsu, then we have giant thunder beast, Orochimaru, Susanoo... and the last forehead touch from Itachi.\n\nIt was so emotional and hype when i read it the first time being a teenager.",
