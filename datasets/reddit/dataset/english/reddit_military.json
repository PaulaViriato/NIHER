I felt so much anger. How dare you do that? I was working my ass off outside sweating and providing my best service. Y\u2019all can go to hell. Fuck you. I legit had to cry when I got to my car. I only made $77 today and I was a double. I worked for 10 hours.",

If they report to many people MIA, wont the commander be blamed for having to many deserters?\nIf they report nothing when soldiers die, wouldn\u2019t high command ask why they need reinforcements?\n\nIf you keep it up to long the numbers just won\u2019t add up. After a while with new reinforcements every week and no reported casualties it will look like the commander has 1000 soldiers for one small section of the front.\n\nI guess it\u2019s someone higher up who says they should be reported MIA, but wont the people above them react? Is this a conspiracy that goes all the way to Shoigu? Wouldn\u2019t Putin find out and be pissed off?",

The life of a propaganda icon is much better than the life of a highly combative and resistant prisoner.\n\nFor instance, the American soldier who recently defected to NK is over there saying how he was treated inhumanely and suffered a lot of racial discrimination. Is it true? Certainly believable, but absolutely not credible testimony (not that the North Koreans care).\n\nBasically, I would consider these claims to be launching points for investigations, not actual proof or even evidence in and of themselves.",

To pay the grieving families for their sons\u2019 sacrifices is not sustainable. Make sense? While they (the Putinists) don\u2019t want to be bad people, they will do what they want to in order to get what is in their interest. Hence only acknowledging strength as the only means of power.

The International Court of Justice concluded that Britain had illegally separated Chagos Archipelago (that\u2019s the original name of BIOT) from Mauritius when Mauritius sought to seek independence in 1965. Without going into all the details, Britain had coerced Mauritius into signing a treaty so Mauritius could become independent. However, Britain had no right to put conditions on the independence of Mauritius, since as a colony Mauritius had an inalienable right to self-determination. However, the most disgraceful thing that happened was that the people living on Chagos Archipelago were forcefully removed and told they would allowed to come back. As far as I know none of them have and some of them live in Mauritius and others in a slum next to Heathrow Airport. The crazy thing is that the US wouldn\u2019t even mind letting the locals come back on the island and even work in the military base but Britain is ready to die on the hill that this island belongs to them, even though all of its allies think otherwise. When the proceedings for this case were happening there was one of these beautiful and rare moments where the whole world agreed. Everybody agreed that Britain had fucked up and ought to leave the island immediately. \nTo come back to your question: What\u2019s the point of this little island?

The ONLY component of the Russian military that can compete with Sweden is the nuclear-holocaust one (And in the year 2023, I bet you could grab a random person of the streets of Uppsala, and they will know how to build a nuclear bomb).  We know, for a fact, that the Swedes are one of the most professional, well-trained, and well-stocked militaries in the world, not to mention its independence, self-reliability, and self-sustainably.  The incredible and brave Ukrainian people have reminded us that a little creativity and ingenuity can go a long way in killing Ruzzians, so I have a strong feeling that there will be  an armada of SAAB aircraft hauling 1000s of IKEA's newest hot item, the \"Tank in a Box\", to Red Square.  And all Swedes are equipped with an Allen Wrench before they're deployed, so they can construct the tank, while completely alone and under hostile fire, in 1-17 hours.  All yuks yuks, giggles, and funnies aside, I truly don't see a way how Russia could even fight on Sweden's level.  Russia has a very long history of having one tactic, and as we have seen in Ukraine that is \"meat-wave\" attacks.  Compare that to \"those blonde-haired, LGBTQ+ loving hippies\" in Sweden, and it turns out, goddamn they have  tradition of kicking ass.  Russia already knows this because of history.  Also, how can we ignore Sweden's ability to...  Oh wait... what's that?  Oh... Wow.  Turns out Sweden is in NATO now, so ummmmmmmm, yea.  Looks like the 1992 USA Men's Olympic Basketball DREAM TEAM just picked up that tall, Swedish fella with perfect fundamentals, all of his own equipment, and a shot that is sweeter than molasses and smoother than butter.  Speaking of molasses and butter, do they still have access to those in Russian grocery stores?  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd FYI, I know this isn't exactly proof or anything, but as a fella who lived right by Boystown in Chicago, I can say that I have seen some very tough and very strong gay men in fist fights outside of bars.  They are not afraid to fight, and I'll just use common logic to assume that the many, many people who do not identify as Putin would prefer, are excellent fighters, as well.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nScrew Ruzzia's bigotry.  STOP Russian aggression.  Add Japan, Australia,  and South Korea to NATO... And for the heck of it, let's add Mongolia.  What would Russia even be able to do about it?  And I'm pretty sure Winnie the Pooh of the CCP wouldn't realize because he wants that sweet HUNNY pot across the Taiwan Strait.  LOL good luck, China.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWelcome to NATO, Sweden.  If you have any extra rainbow flags or patches, bring them to the next meeting.  It seems as though Russians are so stupid that they think anything bright and colorful is... gulp... GAY!!!  So, let's just start throwing rainbow flags at them and they'll run because Pvt. Boris will call Pvt. Sergei a \"homo\" when he picks up one of the flags, and they'll both freak out and run back home, where they will go drink vodka and die, then they will be conscripted to fight against the Swedish again.

They're usually poor and that will be the first \"real\" money they get, so they WILL be BALLING THE FUCK OUT \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nMy brother was in the Navy, I remember the amounts of shit he sent back home while abroad, it was ridiculous. Same with my best friend who was in the Air Force. Now, they're both out and more conservative about spending, but while they were in, we lived it up. Good times...",
                "If you're enlisted, you're grossly over estimating the amount of money you're going to save.  Unless you have quite a bit of time in, the pay is pretty mediocre.  There are a lot of costs to being in the military, or potential costs, that roadblock savings quite a bit.\n\n1. If you want to get married, you're moving every three years.  Good luck having your spouse do anything other than being a server or at walmart.  They work remote?  Maybe a lucky break, but I'm guessing you're screwed.  So you're supporting a family on your shitty minimal income, with maybe some supplementation.  Good luck, lots of dirt poor NCOs out there.\n2. Great you're committed to staying single!  You can live on base (if there's space) for free, and get a fair amount of food, also free, at the DFAC.  Army food fucking sucks, after you get done with 10 months of powdered eggs in training you'll be praying for a ride to the Green Bean coffee place for something that resembles actual food (resembles, b/c it's still fast food garbage).  So, you're getting no 'extra' money for food and using your meagre income to go out to eat because if you're in the barracks (lower enlisted, single) - there's no kitchen.\n3. Ok, you're a literal monk.  You eat the DFAC food, you live in the asbestos filled, lead painted barracks.  You save every cent.  You get a uniform allowance but it doesn't cover things like, your company is out in the field 1/2 of the month every month - and you can't wear shitty uniforms in garrison - so you're shelling out $70-$100 for new patches/uniforms all the time, plus you gotta pay for cleaning since the barracks doesn't have a laundry facility.  Gotta buy boots at rates that are higher than you're getting paid for them (sure, you don't have to buy oakleys with soft soles, just wear the army issued hard soles until they wear down to about a 30 degree angle, I'm sure you won't spend most of your time as some kind of sick call ranger.  Luckily they'll give you lots of motrin 800s to help with your quickly developing ankle, knee, and back problems.  Also, remember, you're living in the barracks; and there's only one thief in the army; everyone else is just trying to get their shit back.  So, the books, games, handheld devices, phones, air pods, food, beer, gaterade, uniforms you carefully spend your money on are gone all the fucking time.  You've got a padlock on your foot chest?  Buddy, I've been out for 12 years and I still have the three bolt cutters I left with.\n4. Travel,  assuming you have friends or family.  You're going to get block leave once a year, some vacation times, 4 day passes.  Airfare, driving, whatever.  You're going to be in shithole places like Ft. Polk, Ft. Sill, Ft. Leanordwood, Ft. Hood - you're family lives on the west coast, the east coast, whatever.  So you visit twice a year - you've got good savings, whatever - as  specialist you're probably blowing a month + wage on plane tickets and incidentals (each trip).\n\nI could go on, about the long hours (you're definitely making under minimum wage), the shitty living conditions, how much it sucks to show up to work if you're in a bad unit (and there's nothing you can do about it except go to prison, so fucking suck it up), the health conditions you'll accumulate from leadership that loves to do 12+ mile marches with 60lb rucks (because they're fucking huah) all the time.  Taking a shit in 115 degree heat in a porta john where the turd from your ass gently kisses the mound of shit piled up below before it disconnects, but whatever, you do you.  We haven't even gotten to longer term, keeping up with the friends you made, and watching them die of kidney failure at 42, 1/4 of them killing themselves (my personal experience), or end up on disability after getting blown up.  If you don't escape an MOS where you're getting shot at, or deployed; you can also look forward to that.  If you think it's easy to come back to a very politically correct society after your deployement... I've got some stock to sell you.\n\nGood luck, I mean it sincerely.\n\nEdit: I would like to add that the Army, and training can suck in ways that you can't even imagine as an average person.  Getting 1-3 hours of sleep at inprocessing where everyone gets one set of PTs, you shower and get back into them,  wait in line for 12-13 hours a day getting yelled at and doing pushups for literally hours, watching people walk by with their shoelaces pulled out after threatening to kill themselves so they can get a medical discharge.  Waking up to someone drinking bleach and vomiting blood mid basic because they can't handle it.  Falling asleep in a hole you dug while fire ants are biting you - and you just don't care.  I'm only on week 6 stuff here.  There's some cool shit, like shooting AT4s, M203s, and whatever - but for every two minutes of cool you spend months just embracing the suck.",

                "From article:\n\nKevin Carroll, a former Army officer who served as senior counsel to Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly during the Trump administration, laid out in stark terms on Tuesday a part of the most recent indictment against former President Donald Trump that has not received wide attention.\r  \n\r  \nCarroll\u2019s op-ed in The Dispatch, titled \u201cAn Unthinkable Choice,\u201d leads with a jarring subhead that declares, \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s advisers would have put the U.S. military in the position of defying orders or turning their weapons on civilians.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nCarroll begins by writing, \u201cAs a veteran, my blood ran cold reading two particular passages in special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s indictment.\u201d He goes on to explain that in those two specific paragraphs, Smith details how then-President Trump and the team of election-denying lawyers surrounding him laid out an \u201cautocratic plan to remain in power\u201d that would \u201cmake the U.S. military choose between subservience to civilian control or refusing to undertake an anti-democratic domestic political role.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nCarroll continues, noting that Trump\u2019s alleged coconspirators had discussed how to quell the inevitable rioting should he overturn the 2020 election:\r  \n\r  \nIn the first passage, it appears that when a deputy White House counsel warned Assistant Attorney General Jeffrey Clark that if Trump remained in office despite the absence of any evidence of outcome-determinative election fraud, riots would break out in U.S. cities, Clark responded, \u201cThat\u2019s why there\u2019s an Insurrection Act.\u201d In the second, the indictment reports that when similarly warned of the risk of riots, Trump\u2019s outside counsel John Eastman responded that there were points in American history when violence was necessary to protect the republic.\r  \n\r  \nHe goes on to explain that Trump\u2019s plan included having then Vice President Mike Pence nullify electoral college votes in key states won by Biden and have them replaced by Trump votes, changing the outcome of the election. Pence, in recent days, has made clear in media interviews that this was indeed Trump\u2019s plan, which he refused to go along with.\r  \n\r  \nTrump\u2019s team \u201canticipated that this unconstitutional act might lead to widespread unrest, and that they planned for the commander-in-chief to order federal troops (or federalized National Guardsmen) to put down those riots. The armed services were to be told to use force against Americans to keep Trump in office, despite the objective fact, as established in more than 60 judicial proceedings, that Biden won the 2020 election,\u201d Carroll explains, focusing on the planning for the aftermath of overturning the election.\r  \n\r  \nCarroll lays out how the scenario would unfold as soldiers face down rioting Americans in the streets, resulting in a \u201ctragic loss of life\u201d that could easily spiral out of control.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cThe presidential demand anticipated by Clark and Eastman would place military leaders in the excruciating position of responding to an order facially legal under relevant statutes, but given for a purpose inimical to the ideals of the framers of the Constitution to which they swore an oath,\u201d Carroll argues, adding:\r  \n\r  \nGenerals would be forced to choose whether to abandon an unbroken tradition of American military obedience to civilian control, or turn their guns on civilians to facilitate a losing candidate remaining in the White House beyond Inauguration Day.\r  \n\r  \nThe foreseeable consequences of Clark, Eastman, and Trump\u2019s criminal plot would have been profound for the military and the nation. I suspect the generals would have reluctantly chosen the first of the two bad options they faced.\r  \n\r  \nCarroll concludes by adding that if Trump is convicted for conspiracy related to his efforts to overturn the 2020 election the \u201cpotential harm\u201d of his desire to turn the military on the American public to remain in office \u201cshould be taken into account in the former president\u2019s sentencing.\u201d",

But they acknowledged none rival Starlink\u2019s reach.\n\n\u201cStarlink is indeed the blood of our entire communication infrastructure now,\u201d Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine\u2019s digital minister, told NYT.\n\nThe technology, he said, enabled artillery teams, commanders and pilots to watch drone footage simultaneously while chatting online. According to soldiers, the response times from finding a target to hitting it have been cut to about a minute from nearly 20 minutes.\n\n\u201cThe huge number of lives that Starlink has helped save can be measured in the thousands,\u201d Mr Fedorov added. \u201cThis is one of the fundamental components of our success.\"\n\nMr Musk also asked the US last year to fund for their internet services to Ukraine because they could not continue the arrangement. The company estimated the cost at nearly $400m over 12 months, according to a SpaceX letter reported by CNN.\n\nAbout 1,300 Starlink terminals purchased through a British supplier stopped working last year after the Ukrainian government could not pay the $2,500 monthly fee for each, according to the report.\n\nMeanwhile, defence secretary Lloyd Austin in June approved a Pentagon deal to buy 400 to 500 new Starlink terminals and services, that would provide the Pentagon control of the setting where the internet signal worked inside Ukraine for new devices to carry out \u201ckey capabilities and certain missions\u201d.",

The French and the Germans were literally colluding with Russia and tried to block efforts by eastern European countries to have a unified front against Russia. FFS, the rabid anti-American German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, who as the leader of Germany said and did horrible things, was cheered on across Europe. The idea was that Putin = good, because USA = bad. Europeans ate it up. There were memes, even. Schroeder, the moment he left office, was given an executive job at Gazprom, Russia's government petroleum company. Just a coincidence of course.\n\nMore than two months into Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year, the Germans and the French were both dragging their feet. Let's not forget this. Germany literally blocked sanctions against Russia as long as they could. \n\nPoland, and the US were right all along and yet somehow smug, chauvinistic Europeans have made no apologies about enabling the Russians for many years, and deliberately, meticulously hampering US and Eastern European countries to prepare for Russia using its military to achieve Putin's aims. The Europeans complained that by having unlateral military agreements with Poland, Hungary, Romania, Czech Republic etc... the US was harming European interests. The French and the Germans were literally trying to sacrifice their eastern European allies to appease Putin, and for the least pure motives possible. France and Germany have been mad about US influence in Europe and want that influence for themselves and allowing Russia to do what it wanted was a small price to pay for sticking it to the Americans.\n\nThe Europeans were dragged kicking and screaming onto the right side of this issue, but only did so when the political price of submitting to Russia was more damaging than the price of doing the right thing and angering Putin.",

It's like saying \"I promised that I wouldn't give Jim money for drugs, I just gave him gas money to get to the drug dealer, free needles, and paid for a hotel room for him to use the drugs in.\"\n\nAlso, Tuberville technically isn't even stopping confirmations from proceeding. He's just refusing to participate in the unanimous consent vote. So any confirmations that the Senate wants to do would need to be done as an actual floor vote.

If starlink allowed that, they would instantly require ITAR compliance for every single starlink receiver they shipped and disable all use outside of the US - which would kill the business. Roughly a year ago (IIRC) Ukraine used starlink to control a boat drone that attacked a Russian ship (probably in Sevastopol, don't remember), it became public knowledge and starlink killed access within all of Ukraine for a brief period of time before just cutting access in Crimea. IIRC they also implemented a max speed cap, as well? Not sure. Originally, starlink didn't support the terminal being used while moving at all but they updated the software to allow that so that Ukrainian defenders could communicate on the move and didn't have to worry about triangulation followed by incoming artillery. Starlink provided the terminals to be used for communication, not to be used as a weapons component. Ukraine has shown a willingness to use starlink to control drones (can't blame them) in the past even though specifically asked not to, so starlink has to protect itself as a company.\n\nETA: after reading more of the article, the tweet is utter mendacious horseshit.

            "title": "Ross Coulthart on TOE: It is a FACT that for decades, the military has been actively manipulating Hollywood depictions of aliens. WHY??",
            "selftext": "According to Ross Coulthart, and references he\u2019s provided, the US military is very active with intervening in Hollywood movies to shape the public narratives about aliens. Given this fact, the big question is WHY? Why do our tax dollars going to the US military end up spent on the military approaching Hollywood movie producers to alter their scripts about aliens and UFOs?\n\nI\u2019ve made a transcript of [Ross Coulthart being interviewed by Curt Jaimungal on the Theories of Everything podcast, posted on July 1st, 2023](https://youtu.be/MQnGcX7oxms?t=4701). I\u2019ve attempted to link the video to start precisely at 1 hour, 18 minutes and 21 seconds. My transcript is below:  \n  \nRoss:  \n>**And what people don\u2019t realize is that it\u2019s part of Grush\u2019s allegations that they\u2019ve been deliberately disinformed by the Pentagon and by the Intelligence Community. That there\u2019s been an active disinformation that frankly our media and our movies and our TV shows have been manipulated. Literally, you\u2019ve had people from the intelligence and military coming in, and actually controlling and dictating, by regulating access to military resources, how movies are told.**  \n  \nCurt:  \n>Explain about that please.  \n  \nRoss:  \n>Oh, sure. For example, my cohost of my podcast Need To Know, Bryce Zabel, Bryce is an illustrious Hollywood screen writer and producer, and he made a TV series that was very much the precursor to X-Files, called Dark Skies. And in Dark Skies it tells the story of alien beings secretly operating at the time of JFK, infiltrating the US government. And essentially, it\u2019s a science fiction story. And he postulates that JFK was murdered because of his attempts to bring this out into the open, the fact of a secret alien presence on planet Earth. Now that\u2019s fiction. And in one of the sequences, the alien possess humans by  frighteningly emitting a ganglion from their mouth and literally putting it inside a human being and taking them over, and it\u2019s quite frightening and terrifying, and it\u2019s one of the graphic video images you can see on Dark Skies. Bryce had a lot of fun telling it.  \n  \n>**But the way he tells it, he and his co-producer colleague were approached by the Department of Navy Intelligence. In secret, they were approached and offered the opportunity to tell the story accurately how aliens really do possess people. Now they can\u2019t verify the truth of what these guys were telling them. But what both he and Brent, his colleague, have attested to is that they were actually approached by a military agency, and offered the opportunity to collaborate on getting the information in their fictional series as accurate as possible. And apparently that\u2019s been happening in Hollywood for *years*. There have been collaborations between the Pentagon, the Defense Department, the intelligence community, and movie makers.**  \n  \nCurt:  \n>Sorry, do you put \u201caccurate as possible\u201d in quotations? Because you feel like they\u2019re gonna feed them disinformation at this point?  \n  \nRoss:  \n>I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. But I don\u2019t know the truth of it. I mean, I don\u2019t know if aliens do have such capacities, if aliens exist. **But isn\u2019t it intriguing: Why would a military intelligence agency be wanting to actively involve itself in controlling the output of a fictional TV show, to influence the public about a Non-Human Intelligence, aliens. That\u2019s been happening in Hollywood for years.** And since Bryce and I spoke about on our Need To Know podcast, which people, by the way, can access at www.needtoknow.today,  \n  \nCurt:  \n>The link will be on screen right now, as well as in the description.  \n  \nRoss:  \n>Sure. **But since we spoke about that, I\u2019ve heard from other people who\u2019ve told me about how there\u2019s been active attempts by US military and intelligence to essentially influence how movies are told, when it comes to talking about Non-Human Intelligence, for decades. Why are they doing that? What\u2019s the role of the military or the intelligence community in influencing fictional stories in Hollywood. Why would they feel the necessity to do that? I\u2019m just asking that question. But again, it\u2019s the lack of curiosity by media, because a lot of this has been dismissed as tin foil hat nonsense, and conspiracy theories. It\u2019s not, it really isn\u2019t. I mean, I know for a fact. I\u2019ve spoken to directly to producers and film makers who\u2019ve had these approaches. And there are whole books written about the way, uh, I think there\u2019s one called, I think it\u2019s called Silver Saucers. I recommend it, it\u2019s a great read, talks about how Hollywood has routinely been meddled with by the military and intelligence community on the issue of UAPs.**  \n\nI found the book that Ross referenced. I haven\u2019t read it, but it is [Silver Screen Saucers: Sorting Fact from Fantasy in Hollywood's UFO Movies (2015) by Robbie Graham](https://www.amazon.com/Silver-Screen-Saucers-Sorting-Hollywoods/dp/1910121118)",

He told me that's considered a problem there and that one thing they were starting to do was work with script writers and producers to get their agency into popular culture, in a favorable way of course. Apparently this would help with funding and especially recruitment. I guess there is a bit of interagency rivalry plus competition for hiring top talent. Also, he seemed a little pissed that they never get credit in the public eye for some of their accomplishments.

                "Some things I don't think Coulthart doesn't consider/is ideologically blind to:\n\n* I don't identify with his \"sympathy\" toward defense contractors and the military-industrial complex.  He says he believes that private companies have every right to tell the US (or other) governments to \"piss off\" regarding possession of UAP technology - seemingly provided that they \"acknowledge\" that they have it.  HARD DISAGREE.  Two reasons.  1) Our tax payer funds were the point of origin, regardless if that tech is in the hands of private industry at the moment and this fact has not been disclosed to the public and not subject to oversight and I believe is either not completely legal or is the best case EVER to enact eminent domain. In all the history of misuse of that railroad tactic were to ever be justified, THIS is it. If, as Coulthart puts it, private industry has full claim to recovered tech then they can COMPLETELY handwaive the public's right to know away by claiming it as a \"trade secret\".  There is no fucking regulation in place for this. Fuck that idea completely. 2) The technology involved, if it even exists, obviously holds the power to be so very transformative, not just to contemporary society, but to our *entire species*, that it should NOT be in the possession of ANY unanswerable authority, private or governmental body.\n\n* Coulthart speaks about imminent WW III due to situations in Russia, Iran, China, etc, beginning to boil over.  Because of those very real and potentially utterly devastating threats, this may complicate disclosure in a very direct way.  Consider Grusch's use of the term \"arms race\".  This could be completely literal, and disclosure could present a real national security risk because you may be revealing things about 1) Methods of collection and detection, 2) potential weapons and countermeasures in development in anticipation of a war that may be unimaginably catastrophic.\n\n* The military has long track record of Hollywood involvement because they see Hollywood as an arm of their own propaganda.  They have been at this for many decades.  They want the US military to be represented in a way that puts them in a glamorous light.  Regarding shows and films that have aliens... Much of this entertainment, the vast bulk of it, involves military fighting the aliens.  I don't think the military much cares about the aliens themselves, there isn't really a universal depiction of them in entertainment.  They do care about their latest jets and tanks looking cool as fuck on film though.",
                "1) To maintain an image and promote themselves. Make public in general more amenable to war and secure funding (follow the money). To encourage recruitment by ensuring the public see them has heroes. General propaganda. \n\n2) Muddy the waters - Insert real classified alien info into fiction so average citizens will immediately dismiss any genuine claims. \"oh, so xyz is real, but happened exactly like the movie abc? bull shit. Aliens are fake\"\n\n3) Prevent mass hysteria by easing the public into accepting that aliens are real\n\n\nI could see any of these being valid reasons. What I don't see is a reason why government would NOT interfere with Hollywood. Whether it's just general nationalistic propaganda or an alien conspiracy... who knows?",

The government can only dictate how the military is portrayed because it\u2019s an actual entity and they can sue. The \u201cUS Army\u201d is a trademarked organization. \n\n\nUFOs is just a subject. The military can\u2019t control those depictions legally. \n\nAnd I\u2019ve never heard any rumors or back alley rumblings from any actors, writers, or directors about being pressured by the military over UFOs, but I\u2019ve heard hundreds of stories about this pressure over military movies. \n\nMovie makers can skirt this as well by simply not making the depiction be the \u201cMarines\u201d or \u201cUS Army\u201d or any official branch. They can simply have generic soldiers that are American but have no official insignias and the use military can\u2019t do Jack shit about the portrayal of anything. This is why a lot of cheaper action movies have generic gear on soldiers with no insignias other than a countries flag. You bypass the legal issues and the government can\u2019t force you to comply with any rules over portrayal. \n\n\n\nIdk. I don\u2019t buy this one. Directors are notorious for trying to skate by military regulation on their movies and making a big stink about it. I just don\u2019t buy that they all remained silent about this especially considering this would have to be done in an unofficial capacity considering they have NO LEGAL FOOTHOLD to pressure Hollywood on this. \n\n\n\nDon\u2019t buy it personally.",

A judgement, Jesus Second coming, rapture, enlightenment,  whatever u want to call it.  All religions are correct. Something more intelligent created you, wants you to love one another, protect the planet, and one day we will return.   \n\nFor me it's glaringly obvious.   The bible book of creation shows God being presented with a barren desolate planet that he must transform and repolulate.  It seems like genesis starts after a cataclysm, the last one.  The bible ends with revelation, a worldwide cataclysm.   That will probably be followed again with a new genesis story. The bible talks about the sons of god walking the earth and desiring and having sex with human women. A seeding program? A hybridization program?  The bible talks about Adam and eve being forbidden from eating of the tree of knowledge.   They did, became as intelligent as God and were banished.

For how long they\u2019ve had to prepare, Taiwan is under equipped and not ready to match the PLA when they launch the invasion. Taiwan needs way more missiles, more air defense, and they aren\u2019t getting it , because USA Taiwan\u2019s main ally is struggling to ramp up missile production PLUS the demands of Ukraine war PLUS demands of U.S. military for Pacific missions.\n\nExample A, USA Lockheed Martin produces only 500 LRASM a year, simulations by CSIS and RAND say we run out of LRASM and most other PGMs in the first months of a war. That is just not enough and I guarantee China has stockpiled far more in preparation for this war. They took preparing very seriously they have an entire ground branch dedicated to just launching missiles, meanwhile USA Taiwan and Asian allies don\u2019t have nearly enough missiles to match the PLAARF let alone the rest of the PLA.\n\nHere is article from US Navy Intelligence Chief saying [Americans are disturbingly ill-informed and naive on China](https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2023/02/americans-are-disturbingly-ill-informed-and-naive-china-navys-intel-chief-says/383046/).\n\nThere will be a big shock many think of China as the agrarian nation it was in 1990s that is not the China of 2023 and not the China of the future.",

China knows that too, which is likely why they haven't pushed. They know the west owuld get involved, and they know if Taiwan collapsed or those sectors were damaged, they'd be fucked just as much in some regards.  \n\n\nIt's a big reason why the US has been sinking money back into trying to build their own stuff, but even the US is so far behind Taiwan in that field.",

That being said here's what I see in the video and I'm probably not the only one. In the beginning of the video I see a balloon with an LED in it. I've been into you all closed for a very long time since I was a little kid, and the light in the balloon trick is an old one it's been around since the beginning of hoaxing UFOs. It's probably a bluish colored LED cuz that's what it looks like. In the second part of the video this is not the same light. It's not the same shape and it's not the same color. It went from being a very bright crisp high intensity bluish color to a yellow doll incandescent light color. To be honest what it looks like is the sun behind lots of clouds and soot or some other light in the background behind lots of clouds or smoke or soot. But I don't think the two videos are related at all I think the video of the military is something that was existing and somebody hoaxed the balloon situation and put the two together to lend an air of proof to the video.

                "Here are the relevant parts for Ukraine:\n\n>\u2026That same month, SpaceX told the U.S. Defense Department that it could not continue the arrangement and asked the Pentagon to take over funding. The company estimated the cost at nearly $400 million over 12 months, according to a SpaceX letter reported by CNN, which was verified by The New York Times.  \nThe Biden administration directed a top Pentagon official, Colin H. Kahl, to mediate. On Oct. 7, Mr. Kahl called Mr. Musk, who expressed fears that Ukraine would use Starlink to not just defend itself, but also conduct offensive operations to regain territory seized by Russia, which could cause significant Russian military casualties, a former administration official said. Mr. Kahl told Mr. Musk more people in Ukraine would suffer if Starlink was shut down.  \nMr. Musk nonetheless turned off access for some Starlink terminals in Ukraine. Late last year, about 1,300 Starlink terminals purchased through a British supplier stopped working in the country after the Ukrainian government could not pay the $2,500 monthly fee for each, two people with knowledge of the matter said.  \nStarlink access also fluctuated depending on the movements of the war as Russia won territory and Ukraine fought to take it back. As the battle lines shifted, Mr. Musk used a process called geofencing to restrict where Starlink was available on the front lines. SpaceX uses location data gathered by its service to enforce geofencing limits.  \nThis caused problems. When Ukrainian troops tried retaking cities like Kherson in Russian-controlled areas in the fall, they needed internet access to communicate. Mr. Fedorov and members of the armed forces messaged Mr. Musk and SpaceX employees requests to restore service in areas where the army was advancing.  \nMr. Musk had other red lines that he would not cross. He refused Ukraine\u2019s request last year to provide Starlink access near Crimea, the Russian-controlled peninsula, so it could send an explosive-filled maritime drone into Russian ships docked in the Black Sea, two people familiar with the discussions said\u2026",

                "- Retiring Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Mike Gilday gave up command on Monday. The Navy, Army and Marine Corps are now all without a confirmed leader.\n\n\"This is unprecedented. It is unnecessary. And it is unsafe,\" U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said during a relinquishment ceremony at the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland.\n\nRepublican Senator Tommy Tuberville, who represents Alabama, has blocked hundreds of military nominations from moving forward, saying the Pentagon is improperly using government funding to cover travel costs for abortions for service members and their dependents.\n\n\"This sweeping hold is undermining America\u2019s military readiness. It\u2019s hindering our ability to retain our very best officers and it\u2019s upending the lives of far too many American military families,\" Austin added.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has nominated Admiral Lisa Franchetti to lead the Navy, an historic step that would break a gender barrier in the U.S. military by making her the first woman to command the service and to become a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff - if and when the Senate confirms her. She will lead the Navy in an acting capacity until then.\n\nAfter the U.S. Supreme Court last year overturned the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling recognizing a constitutional right to abortion, the Pentagon said it would cover travel costs for service members seeking abortions and up to 21 days off.\n\nSeveral states have limited abortion access since Roe v. Wade was overturned, and the military argues that women service members cannot choose where they are stationed.\n\nThe Senate's approval of military promotions is usually smooth. Tuberville's hold cannot prevent the Democratic-majority Senate from voting on any promotion, but it can drastically slow down the process.",

As with heightened artillery losses, these are both operationally pivotal and a clear indicator of progress.   My initial reflex is to celebrate these developments...  \n\n\nIf we had some basis for approximating Ukrainian casualties, with these daily loss reports we could calculate the number of Ukrainian lives consumed to achieve these results- how many dead-per-piece of enemy equipment.   Without that, we really have no way of knowing what these trends represent for Ukraine- victory or defeat -or whether we should be taking any comfort or encouragement from them.      \n\n\nNone of which should be taken as an argument for giving up: there is really no alternative to defending your country from a genocidal invader if you want to still have a place called \"home\".   Consider, though: the number of Ukrainian dead is more than every artist you could ever name- every singer, musician, painter, sculptor, animator, designer, writer, \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.

If we realistically want Ukrainians to take back territory it's going to take way more than that if it's even possible with just the UAF. Attrition has decimated both sides at this point.\n\nI don't doubt that Ukrainians are brave and have fought hard, but an impossible task is still impossible. I've talked to people who served in armored units and they're pretty upfront about those defenses in the south. One guy who served in the invasion of Iraq said on company level to expect 50% casualties attacking like that. Even Americans with air superiority would struggle. For Ukrainians, it's going to be impossible. They lost a lot equipment in a single week of this offensive.\n\nI think we should continue to provide Ukraine what it needs to prevent further Russian offensives, but at some point Ukrainians are going to have to come to terms with the loss of those areas as bitter a pill as it is to swallow.  The Russians have built defenses that cannot be overcome without air superiority. Ukrainians almost certainly saved the nation's sovereignty, but that's the most that can realistically be accomplished at this point.\n\nA big part of this comes down to the Ukrainian leaders of the early 2000s being incredibly naive and taking Russia at its word. There is a reason Lithuania,Latvia and Estonia joined NATO so quickly.",

He's spent as much time with as many ARMYs as he could. Gave us so much content from music to magazines to brand ambassadorships, and of course Suchwita. He's shared so much of himself with us these past few months it's almost unbelievable how open Yoongi has been in Chapter 2. \n\nHe's kept the fandom sustained and well-fed for months. I'll be forever grateful for all the times he was active on Instagram and giving us those beautiful photos that we still don't know the reason for. He's always been a gentle, steady presence in BTS and his dedication to his brothers and to ARMYs, to keep this bond going, is so admirable. \n\nWhat makes me so glad is that he and BTS are doing this on their own terms. They get to accomplish the goals they've set, and I'm sure Yoongi will do very well just like Hobi and Jin. Yoongi really meant it when he said let's meet each other in 2025.

                "We knew it was coming, but it still hurts. This one hits hards especially, as a Yoongi bias and right after that incredible Comeback and tour where he did it all and left nothing behind. Wishing him an uneventful and easy service \ud83d\ude4f 2025 can't come fast enough.",
                "I know it seems extremely short-term to announce right after the concerts, but this is just the extension termination announcement. It makes sense he would wait until after his schedules are done because once he gets called  up he is tied to their schedule. It will likely be a short period of time still until he properly goes in. At least it was for Jin and jhope. Probably wants to get the ball rolling asap.\n\nAt this point, I\u2019m viewing it as they all have to go, and the sooner they get in the sooner they get back.",

What a weird, exciting and kinda melancholic, roller coaster this has been.\n\nGroup hug everyone",
                "Kind of expecting this, tbh--out of all of them Yoongi seems like the type to just do these kinds of things without much warning. And listen, I know the fandom hasn't even had 24 hours to process, but isn't this such a mic drop-type statement? Finish everything he wanted to do, close off his chapter with his D-Day Final concerts, a perfect, 3-day culmination of his journey thus far, then immediately start the termination of his postponement and begin the process of enlistment. I see this as one more shibal on top of all the other shibals he's already given throughout the duration of his tour.",
                "I was thinking within the week and they said TOMORROW IS THE DAY.\n\nSuga has served as such a connective tissue in Chapter 2 by creating Suchwita to allow the members to share their projects, and sharing his stage with them too. Suga has always been tbe \u201cgoals man\u201d in BTS clearly stating what his hopes & wishes were so him reaffirming his desire to continue with BTS for many decades to come was comforting.",

Jin will be discharged in less than a year already. So much as it may suck, they'll all be discharged before we even know it.",

                "Can't explain how grateful I am to Yoongi for all he did since BTS halted group promotions.\nEven with the looming enlistment, he could have taken some time off for himself, but he didn't.\nHe choose to use most of his time before military enlistment to do so many things for army. Even before 2022 Festa, he started working on his album, the documentary, probably started working on the tour. Then after Festa he created Suchwita, prepared for the tour, finished his album (which we know thanks to the documentary, it was a very cathartic experience for him). Plus all his different collaborations, because Yoongi does love music so much he can't stop.\n\nAs he has said many times, he thought of this tour for himself, as he missed performing so much, but also fo army, because he knew it woudl be an hard time for us. Suchwita as well, it was his way to offer a place for Bangtan to promote, but also to cheer up army through a variety which would have BTS in some way (then it became something even bigger, which I'm very glad for).\n\nAll to say that Yoongi spent so much of his time before enlistment doing so much for us, knowing  that Chapter 2 would be difficult for many.\nHis promo style that had so many different things was for me his way to say, \"Here, I'm trying to cheer up everybody regardless of their interests!\".\nAnd that's without talking about D-Day, in which despite having already get over his hurt, he still went back to it since he knows many armys find comfort and understanding in his previous mixtapes.\nHe ended it with Life Goes On, which is of course very fitting for this time where we will miss him so much, but it's also another big reminder about how much he loves BTS and if the many times he  has repeated it weren't enough, how much he's waiting to perform with them again.\n\nSo what this rambling was meant to do was to appreciate all the things he did for armys, giving up his time for us. He didn\u2019t even take that much time off after his tour, he just finished and went straight to start the enlistment procedures, because like us he probably just want it do be done so he can be back doing what he loves the most!\n\nAs I did for Seokjin and Hobi, I'm wishing for him to have the less stressful enlistment possible and hoping time will suddenly go twice as quick so that it can be 2025 already \ud83e\udd72",

Since the D-Day tour  announcement in February, I\u2019ve felt like this has been my year of really \u201cgetting to know\u201d Yoongi, by diving deep into his discography, learning of how vulnerable and raw he is through his lyrics. Through the anticipation of his tour, the privilege of witnessing his live shows, and streaming 20-something times with my ARMY friends, I feel like I\u2019ve been able to really experience his artistry and be a part of his musical journey. I\u2019m so grateful for the music and stories he has shared with us through the album and the tour, these are memories I will cherish forever. I hope that by opening that door on the final day he finds happiness and love on the other side. I\u2019ll miss him so much but I know he will return to us soon \ud83d\udc9c",

Armed flying drones are the thing you never see videos of because they are the real autonomous weapon.  Quad copters with target recognizing thermal cameras and software to track targets and project them onto tablets where you can just click one and a drone fires on that target.. that's the future of warfare.. until these robots can effectively do combative grappling they are basically just show pieces.

If they decide to move from point A to point B without teleporting, when they are on the ground they walk with \"legs,\" (as would be perceived by humans) and when they are in the air they fly with \"wings\" (as would be perceived by humans).  But their mode of travel is still perceived by humans as a biological extension of their body, not some ship, car, boat or other craft as is falsely being alleged by the governments conducting the hoaxes and counter-hoaxes.\n\nSatanic-minded humans been hoaxing each other with \"UFO's\" for decades.  Sometimes they even create biological entities that don't exist (with gene editing technology that allows them to make all kinds of creatures that don't exist in nature), and they will take these fake \"aliens\" and place them inside a fake \"UFO\" and then crash it somewhere to hoax some dumb-ass group of competing humans into spending trillions to research a pile of human-made technology trash. Humans have also figured out how to project images and sounds into the sky, of any size or volume (from the size of a car to the size of 100 skyscrapers, and with the volume of a lightning strike), giving the appearance of anything just hovering and making sounds in the sky.  They could project an image of Max Headroom into the sky, the size of the New Years Blimp, and have him talking to you (like some talking head in the sky).  They use laser-based holograms and directed-energy audio waves to do this, and it is all technology made by humans that has NOTHING to do with ET.\n\nIf you believe that \"aliens\" are using \"spaceships\" to visit us from another solar system, I have a bridge in Brooklyn for sale if you are interested. The only accurate description of Angels/Demons and Gyn is found in the Torah/Talmud/Bible/Quran/Hadith.  Those are the only books that tell humans the truth about life that is technologically superior to humans.

            "title": "Victoria 3 - Dev Diary #93 - Military Improvements in Open Beta",
            "selftext": " For all of you out there that still use Old Reddit here is a link to this [Dev Diary](https://pdxint.at/45dN7YH) on our forum. \n\n[https:\\/\\/pdxint.at\\/45dN7YH](https://preview.redd.it/z0axruhggoib1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a9d2a1605f8b6f277d945f2215551a42de1d0388)\n\nHappy Thursday to you all! This is a particularly exciting dev diary for me to write, because I finally get to reveal details on what we've been working on since before the summer months - and strap in, because it's a lot!\n\nI want to start out by talking a bit about the Open Beta and expectation setting. As we discussed in [Dev Diary #91](https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/victoria-3-dev-diary-91-post-summer-plans.1592114/), we will be running an extended Open Beta from Aug 28th (alongside the launch of the 1.4 update) until our final release of 1.5 in late autumn. During this time we anticipate releasing at least 2 additional updates to the Open Beta branch, coinciding with our 3-week sprint schedule.\n\n**Expectations for the first update**\n\nLaunch date: Aug 28. In the initial release, new features will be in a rudimentary state, with plenty of placeholder interfaces, graphics, and missing mechanical details. Many features will be exploitable and buggy, and *absolutely* not balanced. Some features will be unused or underused by the AI. Core components of the game that we have not touched should continue to work, so playing a game focused on economy and politics should not be heavily affected by these changes, but be aware that military campaigns may feel unsatisfying or cumbersome. If you wish to partake in testing this update, focus on [feedbacking](https://discord.com/channels/831406775416782868/1069987282607669258) on what additions or balance changes would make the new features fun, not on whether they feel great *right now*.\n\n**Expectations for the second update**\n\nTentative launch: mid September. By this time the new features should feel a lot more mature, with bugs and missing information / graphics filled in, additional mechanical details closing exploits and providing new optimization challenges, and in general more bells and whistles available to you. While beta testing this update, in addition to the aforementioned considerations, focus on balance and UX improvements.\n\n**Expectations for the third update**\n\nTentative launch: mid October. If all goes as planned, at this point we should be fully feature-complete for the 1.5 release. This doesn't mean everything is wrapped up and ready to go! We will spend the time between this update and the final release fixing bugs, doing balance updates, and reacting to your feedback. While testing this update you should be able to focus on how fun the game is to play with the new features.\n\nBut first a short message from our Community Manager Pelly on how the Open Beta will be run!\n\n \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nHello! For those that don\u2019t recognise me, I am the Community Manager for Victoria 3 and helped run the Open Beta for 1.2 last time.  \nOpen Betas are a very involved process, not just from the developers, but also on the community team end too! \n\nWhen the Open Beta for 1.5 starts, the old 1.2 channels will be reopened for usage by the community! Any user can access these, to make it as easy as possible to provide feedback and chat about the Beta update!\n\nAs soon as the Open Beta is live, you can access the Beta Steam branch by following these instructions:\n\n* Right click Victoria 3 in your steam Library, select properties.\n* Click on \u2018Betas\u2019, then in the \u2018Beta Participation drop down box select the 1.5 Open Beta option, when it is live, it will appear there similar to these options.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ipygmhgngoib1.png?width=783&format=png&auto=webp&s=38887c1d553e4d6dd6cb5352f8a541ed6f2d84fb\n\nNow a bit about the Discord Channel structure:\n\n* Open-beta-news - where news about the open beta is posted, e.g. when Beta updates are announced.\n* Open-beta-changes-and-bugfixes - where changelogs for the Beta updates are posted so you know what has been changed or fixed between versions.\n* Open-beta-pelly-post - this is where I go through all the feedback and bug reports for the day. Then I list them here, with any dev responses or mark if they are duplicates. This helps everyone know that their items have been looked at and seen by the devs! This is updated every day for the previous day's issues, normally closer to 16:00 CEST!\n* Open-beta-chat - the area to chat generally about the beta updates, I still know people who really enjoyed talking here and became part of the \u2018open-beta-chat\u2019 gang!\n* Open-beta-feedback - *The* place to post any feedback about the updates, tags are used to distinguish the topic and if it has been looked at by devs/! Developers will be around to talk in these threads, however don\u2019t expect an answer for every single thread!\n* Open-beta-bug-reports - We don\u2019t normally have bug reporting on discord, as the bug reporting forums are the place to post these issues. However, during the Open Beta period it is easier if we have both feedback and bug reports on the same platform for ease of communication.\n\nThat is all from me, I hope you will enjoy the Open Beta when it starts and I see people around! \n\nI will be there most of the time and happy to chat to y\u2019all if you have any questions.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nNow let's jump into the juicy stuff! For these features we are looking to improve the military gameplay in three broad areas: **Agency**, **Depth**, and **Visuals**. \n\nBy **Agency** we mean the degree of control the player feels they have over their military campaigns. Equally important to granting more agency is ensuring the player doesn't experience a *lack* of agency, for example by having more fronts to manage than Generals; uncontrollable, unpredictable front splitting; or armies that suddenly return home because their General decided an active front was an opportune place to die of old age.\n\n**Depth** refers to both detail and realism. More military attributes and configuration options, armies and fleets that are composed and behave more like you'd expect from history, and more interesting decision-making during warfare.\n\n**Visuals** require little introduction: it's about what we have come to affectionately refer to internally as \"little dudes on the map\". Seeing your armed forces in action, in transit, and being able to put a concrete location on everything (which also helps with agency).\n\n## Shared Fronts\n\nOne issue that can rear its ugly head from time to time in the current version of Victoria 3 is the very large number of fronts you may be dealing with at any given moment. Many of you have pointed out that this leads to mandatory micromanagement of the war effort, which defeats the design goal that led us to create a more hands-off system for Victoria 3 in the first place. Reducing the number of fronts, especially in wars involving several countries on either side, to a more manageable number is a big priority for us.\n\nThe first in a one-two-punch effort to solve this problem is to make fronts adjacent between two or more allied countries into a single unified front. This can drastically reduce the number of fronts active at the start of a war.\n\n[ There isn't that much more to say about shared fronts, which is a good thing. While quite complex in implementation \\(and we still have a few edge cases to sort out\\), they do what it says on the tin and are very intuitive in play. Here's an example of a single front between Bavaria and W\u00fcrttemburg on one side, and Hesse, Frankfurt, and Baden on the other. In the current live version this would be 4 unique fronts! ](https://preview.redd.it/w3480qntgoib1.png?width=889&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ad5ea2aa678936becd0e9fb4a52be204bfe2338)\n\n## State-based Front Movement\n\nThe second strike in our fight against too numerous and unpredictable fronts is state-based front movement. While merging adjacent fronts is a method of controlling the initial number of fronts between known participants, the bigger problem for most players is the unpredictable front splitting and merging that happens during the course of war, as battles are won and small pocket theaters are created. This feature eliminates the uncertainty of what might happen once a battle concludes, and drastically reduces the number of \"temporary\" fronts that emerge (which then causes you to lose the war because you don't have another General to staff it with so your enemy stomps all over you).\n\nIt works like this: battles will be fought in a province like before, but when you win you capture a fraction of the state that province is in, not a number of provinces. Only one state can be captured at a time, and only once the whole thing has been captured will the front actually move.\n\n[ As part of this we have also permitted battles to be disconnected from frontlines, so you won't be attacking only the border provinces repeatedly until you have won the entire state. In our current build the province is chosen randomly from provinces in the state, but during Open Beta we will enhance this to select from provinces deeper and deeper into the state depending on occupation already earned.](https://preview.redd.it/rzkyjhixgoib1.png?width=788&format=png&auto=webp&s=368e56324e881b1620ed30199f6d8f3c32dc461a)\n\nAs a battle concludes, the winning side earns a victory score - currently just a flat value, but this will eventually be changed to be conditional on the size of the victory. This victory score is allocated towards gaining or clearing occupation in states adjacent to the front, depending on the winning side; defenders will only clear occupation while attackers will clear some from their own states (if any) and gain some in the state they attacked.\n\nIn the current version of Victoria 3, the number of provinces gained on winning a battle are dependent on the size of the win, the stats of the advancing General, and some randomness within a min-max range. With 1.5, the amount of occupation gained in a state from a battle is dependent instead on a comparison between the victory score and the \"occupation cost\" of the state(s) in question. The occupation cost is determined by a number of factors:\n\n* State population\n* Amount of provinces with difficult terrain\n* Number of mobilized battalions left standing in the defender's theater compared to the size of the theater\n\nBoth victory score and occupation cost are broken down in the UI and fully scriptable/moddable. We intend on tweaking both during the Open Beta phase heavily in response to your feedback, to make sure states that are supposed to be hard to take are actually more challenging to conquer (without it becoming a slog) while depopulated savannahs are easier to march across.\n\nWhat we have found in testing this feature is that in addition to controlling the sudden appearance of new fronts, this new behavior also makes it very easy to determine whether you're in control of a particular wargoal. In the future we hope to add new mechanics tied into this feature, such as economic exploitation of states occupied during war.\n\n[ An example of the new outcome of battle and the occupation cost breakdown. In this case Piratini should have gotten to plant their flags across 87&#37; of the state, but some advanced math \\(a.k.a. bug\\) as described by this screenshot only granted 10&#37; - guess it's back to the code mines for me!](https://preview.redd.it/tiin4ib1hoib1.png?width=494&format=png&auto=webp&s=bba26e9ac6feba0e81ca4192b13f9074bdb81d6b)\n\n[ Speaking of flags! While it won't be in the initial Open Beta build, this is one way we plan on visualizing partial state occupation despite the frontline itself not moving, in addition to shading the terrain itself.](https://preview.redd.it/rd9ay7r2hoib1.png?width=1999&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4421cb9f08ffdedf1cf896755e162ec6185b839)\n\nWhile state-based front movement is primarily a way to control and predict the number of fronts that emerge during a war, this feature is also something we're looking to expand on in the future by tying state occupation tighter into other game mechanics, like economics and military supply.\n\nI'll close this section out by saying that while multiple simultaneous battles per front won't be in the initial beta release (should be coming in the 1st or 2nd update), the way we plan to implement and balance them is to only allow 1 battle / front / state at a time. This means you would only potentially benefit from having more Generals than your enemy on particularly long fronts, and even then only if you outnumber their defending troops. This is however an area we are actively going to solicit feedback on, and you'll hear more about it in future dev diaries.\n\n## Military Formations\n\nThis feature has a number of sub-features that I'll go into in some detail, but first a bit of background to what this is and why we're doing it.\n\nHaving Generals and Admirals as the leaders of your armed forces is great both for flavor and for the knock-on effects it can have on the political system, but in retrospect characters are simultaneously too static *and* too ephemeral to serve as good containers of military units for a player to control. Commanders are meant to have names, traits, and faces so you can remember them, and if you have too many of them you can't tell them apart. But limiting the number of them you can maintain simultaneously restricts your ability to fine-tune your military and control who goes where, which can be frustrating (*especially* when you have to assign Generals to an indeterminate number of fronts!)\n\nBut, let's say we put gameplay over narrative concerns about identity uniqueness and removed the cap. Then we run into the issue of having to give every one of them a unique order every time we want them to go somewhere or do something different. This is very annoying when you just want everyone to go defend your single frontline.\n\nTo make things worse, if one of them kicks the bucket due to old age or gets suddenly ripped away due to some special event, your entire military campaign might be irrevocably disrupted in an instant! While we made an initial pass to address this issue in 1.3 with Field Promotion of new commanders, having a non-character container for your armed forces removes this problem altogether - your units will remain in place, and you can assign or recruit a new commander to lead them as you wish.\n\nAnother issue with the current system is that Buildings act as your only main vector for customizing your military. While this makes sense to model the economic and population impact your armed forces have, it can be a cumbersome and unintuitive way of constructing a diverse and capable military.\n\nMilitary Formations tackles the issue of commanders being simultaneously too static and too ephemeral by providing a container for both commanders (generals or admirals, depending on formation type) as well as combat units (battalions / flotillas). You can create as many Formations as you want - with or without commanders, each with as many commanders as you like, and you can move both units and commanders between formations at will.\n\nThe design intent here is to provide you with a kind of *entity* \\- that's programmer-speak for *thingamajig* \\- that is more customizable to your own needs for **agency** than commanders are. These needs may vary a lot depending on what kind of country you're playing, where in the world you are, and what kinds of wars you happen to get yourself into. It also gives us a better platform for customization - adding **depth** \\- than commanders and buildings are, which we will see below. And finally, facets we're including with formations such as concrete movement and unit types give us a lot more opportunities to **visually** represent your military on the map and in the UI. So let's get into some more details!\n\n### Combat Unit Types\n\nIn addition to recruiting commanders into Military Formations (which works similarly to how it currently does in the live version) you can also recruit specific unit types and mix and match to your heart's desire. If you're playing a single-state country and want to recruit 5 Skirmish and 10 Line Infantry, you cannot do so in the current version of the game since unit type is governed by Production Method and all levels of a building must have the same methods. But in 1.5 you *can* do just that in a Formation, and the Barracks that get constructed \"around\" those units as a result will maintain the mix.\n\nThis works by creating the units inside the scope of the Military Formation itself, not by expanding buildings directly. That follows our UX design vision for this feature: rather than configuring and maintaining your military through an awkward mix of interactions with buildings and characters, *all* interactions with your military are done through formations first and foremost, with characters and buildings appearing *around* the formations as supporting entities to ensure existing game mechanics continue to function. \n\n[ In addition to the different types of infantry units, we are also adding additional groups of units with different properties: infantry, artillery, and cavalry on the army side; as well as light ships, capital ships, and support ships for the navy. For the final release, most or all of these will have unique illustrations\\/icons; right now they all have the same placeholder icon. ](https://preview.redd.it/tghwtvi5hoib1.png?width=573&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c60db45fd3e4fbecadb537b8c49d35e78adf404)\n\nUnits constructed in this way will be upgradeable between types (though not for the first Open Beta release) but only in certain cases: you will be able to upgrade your Ship-of-the-Line to Ironclads, as was often done historically, but you cannot upgrade your Ironclads to a different ship class like Battleships.\n\nWe're very interested in hearing your feedback on the specific units we're adding into the Open Beta, how they're grouped and balanced, and how managing them in the UI feels!\n\n### Mobilization Options\n\nI've always been happier with the current mobilization mechanics in theory than in practice. I like the increased demand on my industry during wartime and how that changes my economy (and my pops' economy). I also appreciate that I can't cheese the game by cranking down my consumption of military goods to zero in peacetime and turn it up to max when I'm at war, and that increased consumption is handled automatically as I mobilize a General into activity. I enjoy the tough decisions I sometimes have to make about whether I can truly afford to mobilize another General, or if my currently mobilized forces should be able to mop up the opposition in time.\n\nWhat I don't like about it is how hard it is to balance, both as a designer and player, since it only increases the quantity of goods they're already consuming and therefore can only do so in a quantity that doesn't cause immediate shortages in your economy. Having to maintain mandatory unprofitable import trade routes for guns & ammo with potential elasticity to ensure I can prosecute my future wars sounds cool but can feel a bit much in practice sometimes.\n\nMobilization Options permit you to customize what goods you want to give your battalions when they're out active soldiering, with powerful effects providing trade-offs for the increased costs. Sometimes those goods are military hardware, other times they're just better rations or fancier uniforms. Adding consumer goods as a possible cost to mobilization also means a stronger impact on the civilian population during the war effort, which is both realistic and a great game dynamic.\n\nMobilization Options (typically) impose a cost in goods per unit in a Formation, which is applied to that unit's building, in exchange for an effect on all units. Both cost and effect are applied only when mobilized, and Mobilization Options can be toggled on or off only while the Formation is demobilized.\n\n[ This is the list of Mobilization Options we will launch with the initial Open Beta release \\(fully unlocked, of course\\), but it's neither finalized nor well-balanced. Some of the options may even end up as new unit types instead \\(or in addition to\\) for example. We will be actively seeking feedback on what other options you want to see, and rework the UI to allow us to fit more options. Icons are currently borrowed from other areas of the game and are particularly WIP.](https://preview.redd.it/gc3in8x7hoib1.png?width=748&format=png&auto=webp&s=05d7a7229307241236edcb15c16c15f43df3b58b)\n\nMobilization Options don't have to be just about goods, it can also just be toggles on how you want this Formation to behave. For example, Forced March causes the Formation to move faster but at a cost of increased morale loss (a penalty which could be countered by Luxurious Supplies, if desired). Rail Transport is mutually exclusive with Forced March, doesn't cause morale loss, but requires both the Railway tech and Transportation goods.\n\nThe way we see Mobilization Options used is as toggles that can be set prior to active warfare, taking properties like market conditions, commander traits, and combat unit mix into account. You could customize a small, fast formation of elite crack troops or a giant army of cheap irregulars forced to march on an empty stomach, depending on your strengths as a nation and who you're likely to be fighting against.\n\n### Early Demobilization\n\nWhile we initially added early demobilization with 1.3.6, it was a little bit hacky: it operated as a character interaction rather than a military command, and only applied a flat cost to a country in response to the goods cost prior to demobilization instead of incurring actual consumption.\n\nWe have now made it possible to demobilize armies during active warfare if desired. When this happens, the army will first have to travel home, and will then spend 4 months in demobilization (exact value very much subject to feedback) where mobilization supply cost will be gradually decreased over the duration. Unlike the current live implementation on Generals, these goods will be properly consumed in the interim so your industries and trade routes don't immediately collapse with nothing to gain for it.\n\n[ Early demobilization can also be a little more relevant in the Open Beta due to Mobilization Options, in case those options you provided ended up a little too costly over the course of the war and you want to return home for reconfiguration.](https://preview.redd.it/9mro28jahoib1.png?width=377&format=png&auto=webp&s=019bba3ef8ee0ba77b791ce234e04b67e8db7755)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w7d9q1gbhoib1.png?width=790&format=png&auto=webp&s=d99170275219121a38401ac7f60e6fbed977a026\n\n### Station at HQ\n\nMilitary Formations, both armies and fleets, are initially created in an HQ but do not need to stay there. You can re-station a Military Formation at an HQ - even a temporary one you have established during the course of the war on allied or occupied territory - if you're willing to pay the increased supply cost for doing so depending on where your combat units are actually from (once we get around to adding that increased supply cost that is - until then, re-station away!).\n\n[ You can station a fleet in any coastal HQ. Later during the Open Beta we will require an active Naval Base to exist in order to station your fleet there. ](https://preview.redd.it/kqifm6ddhoib1.png?width=1222&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef6d8d4b3161aecb14416226f81e3d2e631eecc4)\n\n[ This also means if you want to move an army to proactively defend against an impending naval invasion, you can do so \\(as long as you're quick about it!\\) ](https://preview.redd.it/rixe3lsehoib1.png?width=1065&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d87a4bbfe9e1e4f1e5bb341da20b9a72fb96e2b)\n\n### Concrete Location\n\nAnother thing we have been dissatisfied with is the lack of a tangible location for your armed forces. In the current live version, Generals and Admirals are either at the HQ they're recruited into or on a mission somewhere, depending on their current order. But when a commander moves somewhere in response to their order changing, they are put into a kind of limbo while they are moving to a new location (typically a front, with naval movement being more abstracted as an \"execution time\") with the travel time only visualized as a countdown in the UI.\n\nIn the Open Beta, Formations will always have a concrete on-map location, so you can track their real-time movement between locations more easily. Generals and Admirals no longer have their own independent locations as this is inferred by their Formation, but Generals can autonomously spread out across fronts to visually indicate what state they are primarily defending and/or attacking.\n\n[ For the first Open Beta release, movement will be tracked only in straight lines. Here we see an army moving first from the Maranh\u00e3o Par\u00e1 Front, then towards the Maranh\u00e3o Rio Grande do Sul Front, and finally back towards its HQ in Rio de Janeiro when it's demobilized.](https://i.redd.it/fe2zsj2hhoib1.gif)\n\n[ For upcoming Open Beta releases, formations will pathfind across roads, railways, and sea lanes \\(or sea lanes only for fleets, for obvious reasons\\) and travel along those to their destination. Here we see the path taken by an army traveling from \u00d6rebro, Sweden to Tampa, Florida. The short skip over English territory visualized here is because the pathfinder currently does not take either military access or spline travel time into account but just travel length; once we've completed our work on the pathfinder it should still be possible for armies to disembark\\/traverse land\\/re-embark if the time savings makes it worth it, but it will generally be avoided.](https://preview.redd.it/q9os77aihoib1.png?width=1375&format=png&auto=webp&s=88f843be1d91591871c4345d40339c6aa56314e7)\n\n### Transferring Commanders and Units between Formations\n\nOf course there will be moments where you would like to split, merge, or transfer commanders and units between two formations of the same type. Even with shared fronts and state-based occupation, there may be instances where a new front is created in an area where you already have an army - for example, if you join a totally separate war while you already have another military engagement.\n\nThis can be easily done in the field if you have a single formation with multiple commanders. You can right-click one of those commanders and choose to \"Split\" it off into a new formation, which will cause them to quickly take a number of representative units in proportion to their own Command Limit and form a new formation with the same properties and in the same place.\n\nYou can tune this more precisely if you like by opening a Transfer popup, where you can select the exact commanders and units you want to move, select a target formation (which could be a brand new one), and execute the transfer. If the target formation is not in the same location as the origin, a temporary formation will be created that automatically travels to the destination where it will automatically merge with the target.\n\n[ In-game mockups of what the Transfer popup will look like. We're hard at work trying to get this implemented for the first Open Beta release but it might not be fully functional until the second release, in September. We're also considering other potential enhancements to this, such as a double-sided panel where you can transfer Commanders and units back and forth between two formations.](https://preview.redd.it/kqq1xn8lhoib1.png?width=896&format=png&auto=webp&s=8729fc678fb09d6ec7888a23cc90d2fa88231ed2)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vdt6yf2mhoib1.png?width=893&format=png&auto=webp&s=1183800d0c60184f4caeeecb4cdb85cec6a6b3d5\n\n### Name and Icon customization\n\nWhen a formation is first created it gets a name selected based on your primary culture, type, and how many other formations you have of that type. You can change that name to your liking, to help you remember what you've designed it for or just for flavor and immersion.\n\nIn subsequent releases of the Open Beta you will also be able to customize the symbol and color of the formation icon, making it even easier to identify which formation is traveling across the map or deploys across a front.\n\n[ A very work-in-progress screenshot of the formation appearance customization popup. The \\\\\"pattern\\\\\" section will provide a list of possible unique icons while the \\\\\"color\\\\\" section will contain a palette suitable for the formation type.](https://preview.redd.it/vqvjofwnhoib1.png?width=446&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ead9ca3fd3adc6da5b8941654c856df62421a01)\n\n## Revised Naval Invasions\n\nNaval Invasions have also been revised to accommodate the new state-based occupation mechanics and improve the UX in managing naval invasions. Naval Invasion can be initiated either from a formation or the Military Lens. Like in the current version of the game you target a state, but as a follow-up step you then get the option to add the formation(s) to be involved in the invasion. During the Open Beta we will enhance this panel with more information to help inform you on the likelihood of success, such as exposing information about landing penalties and the like.\n\n[In the initial Open Beta release, only one formation of each kind can be assigned to a naval invasion. In upcoming releases you will be able to assign multiple formations of each kind.](https://preview.redd.it/wh9di7qrhoib1.png?width=988&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc920ea2963e2cb5f8138cb4d3020e5afe15a644)\n\nAs you confirm the naval invasion, the formations selected will travel to the sea node just off the coast of the targeted state. When they have both arrived, landing battles will commence. A proper front (with armies assigned to that front) will not be created until the state is fully occupied. When this happens the naval invasion has been concluded.\n\nIn the interim, the supporting fleet may be attacked by enemy fleets. If any of these naval battles are lost, the naval invasion will fail and both formations will return home. If a naval battle is won but heavy ship casualties are taken, landing battles will take higher penalties until the fleet can be reinforced. During the Open Beta we will also look into adding more formations to a naval invasion already in progress.\n\nAside from closing some exploits relating to war exhaustion, this revision will make naval invasions a much more serious affair that requires naval dominance. We will be actively seeking feedback during the Open Beta to ensure executing and defending against naval invasions is more fun and interesting than it is in the currently live version.\n\n[ I don't know about you but I can't wait to see these little guys in action!](https://i.redd.it/vdvnawmuhoib1.gif)\n\n## Frontline Graphics\n\nWhile most of the graphical enhancements will be appearing across the Open Beta period's two updates, we already have a first iteration of frontline graphics functional in the current development build.\n\n[ In this screenshot, the frontline graphics system is using the previous battle graphics and additional VFX as placeholder for the assets we are currently producing.](https://i.redd.it/03jpaxixhoib1.gif)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDue to the size of this Dev Diary we couldn't fit everything on this post!

                "Holy crap, this looks insane.  I think we all expected a military rework at some point, but this absolutely exceeds my wildest expectations.",
                "Huge improvements. Wow.",
                "In the rest of the dev diary, we may get some little soldier sprites in the battles?\n\nHell yeah",
                "Hell yes. This is what we needed. No more assigning 20 generals to a front while that stupid list scrolls up every time.",
                "This is absolutely brilliant. This is like having the old traditional PDX system of units on the map without the actual hassle of having to move them around and siege!\n\nBrilliant, thank you. Let see if when playing it it feels as nice, flexible and with as much agency as it sounds but it looks very promising!",
                "In retrospect, tying armies to leaders (snd not the other way around) was a very bad idea, particularly given that no other Paradox game works like that. Thank god they are reversing it.",
                "Rule 5:\r  \n\r  \nIt\u2019s Dev Diary time! This week, the devs will be covering Military Improvements in Open Beta\r  \n\r  \nAs always here\u2019s the link if you can\u2019t see it above: [https://pdxint.at/45dN7YH](https://pdxint.at/45dN7YH) \r  \n\r  \nUpvotes for link visibility are welcome :)",
                "Ok, I am officially thrilled!",
                "Holy cow!",
                "I really like the expectations for the first one. Pretty simple. It's gonna be buggy and probably not work but that's the best time for everyone to give their inputs so Paradox can tweak/touch it as best as they can.",
                "August 28 is so close and yet so far away!!!\n\nBut anyways, I like the shared fronts, but I don't really understand the change w.r.t state based front movement? Does this mean that troops are more 'discrete' on the map? For example, different contingents/formations will get encircled or something like that? \n\nOr are all wars going to be simulated like WWI-II front warfare?\n\nAlso, combat unit types is the best idea here!",
                "I don\u2019t normally comment much, but this is huge! I really hope this turns out like it sounds like it will. Plus little dudes on the map will be awesome!",
                "Massive improvements, blew away my expectations.\n\nEvery update or dev diary makes me more confident that this game will be an absolute beast in a few years, Im now really optimistic about the diplomacy dlc.",
                "Looks really good! Almost too good, because now I will miss all these improvements when playing normally. Appreciate all the improvements made so far and the responsiveness of the devs. Great work!",
                "Damn, I feel bad for 1.4.",
                "massive W, good work guys",
                "Oh hey. Its exactly the types of changes I was looking for to enjoy v3 again! These proposals sound promising, and I hope they can be implemented successfully. I enjoyed several games, but some of the (especially naval) issues that these fix kept me from trying and enjoying certain tags. I am cautiously optimistic!",
                "Also rework the war score system it's really random. Like an enemy can hold an inch of your territory and your warscore starts plummeting to -100 despite a sol and economy both being done, like it goes from 0 to -50 on the time it takes to have one battle.\n\nSo I guess you need to alter the speed of warscore change based on the conditions. It makes no sense that it would change at the same rate if all of your territory is capture Vs an inch.",
                "Tons of things to be excited about.\n\nIm specially happy about the 'armies have a physical location' one, as I did find it massively annoying how the moment a general was done with an order they ran back home and if you gave a new order they had to like, do the whole trip again.\n\nHopefully this opens the way for more detailed supply lines and such so its not as simple for England to ship its entire army to Asia on a whim. Distance means little right now, be it with naval invasions where once a port is secured you can send EVERYONE in via magic ships, or how Russia can get all its troops to Manchuria with no issue of crossing the literal continent worth of country before.",
                "These military changes look superb, but will the AI be smart enough to take advantage of any of it? In Hoi4 the AI is pretty brain dead when it comes to military customization, and that's a game where the entire focus is military.",
                "I fucking love it!",
                "It sounds like naval invasions against real naval powers will be brutal, and still very difficult against real armies, which is great",
                "If it makes it so that you build actual ships then it will fix the majority of my concerns with the war system",
                "This is really good stuff and basically addresses the bulk of my complaints regarding militaries and the war system.\n\nI've always thought that it made much more sense (mechanically and flavorwise) to design the army first and then appoint generals to lead it.\n\nI'm very excited for 1.5 now.",
                "So we only needed about a year to reach a HOI4 lite military system that looks promissing and feels like something that a finished game should have. Imo this is something that should've been in at the launch of the game, however the second best time to implement it is now.\n\nOne thing that I don't think I really like is the fact that battles can happen in random provinces in the states. I think if I'm holding a mountain front with enough troops to cover all of it I should always defend in mountains. And only then can battles happen in deeper provinces if the defending army doesn't have enough coverage. I hope something like this will be implemented else battles will feel pretty wonky.",
                "Regarding demobilization only feedback I can think of is that rather than locking you out from re-mobilizing, is it possible to make the new unit re-mobilize slower and have a morale penalty based on how long it's been since demobilization?\n\nIdk, I was just thinking it's better to have punishments for certain decisions rather than locking a decision out completely.",
                "Why even have provinces then if it goes by states now?",
                "Great job team. Can't wait to beta test the shit out of this.",
                "This looks great. I've been pretty skeptical about the war system since before the game was announced, but I'm quite excited for this.",
                "This looks really good! I don't mind the warfare system - in fact I like not having to do a massive amount of micro in combat - but the user experience playing as a large or huge size country of having to recruit a dozen generals, upgrade their rank a bit, manually click and assign each to a front is absolutely miserable. That much micro to do relatively simple tasks was completely incongruous and bizarre when contrasted with how little micro is involved when combat actually begins.",
                "When I said this game needed an extra year in the oven, this is pretty much dead on. One year post-launch and the game is starting to look really good.",
                "We're so back",
                "I was wondering how losing battles will work If a general is inside a pocket (encircled), will he die, be captured, or will he teleport magically",
                "This is really cool but is there only going to be one battle per front cause if we get massive fronts I imagine it's going to be frustrating",
                "Can anyone tldr?",
                "Cautiously optimistic about these changes. The current system was so janky, I would have been happy with simply the bug fixes. The additions to player agency and army customization are a huge leap though. It really feels like we have an actual combat system now. \n\nIt\u2019s a shame it wasn\u2019t like this from the get go, but it makes it much easier to recommend this game to others now.",
                "Absolutely incredible. They basically rebuilt the entire thing, super hyped",
                "hype levels are rapidly rising. good job",
                "This is absolutely amazing. Everything here sounds really good. My only downside is I kind of like the frontline feel of seeing where it is and do the push by push by province. I understand why they're changing it to this (I've lost wars because of what they're trying to get rid of xD Looking at you denmark!!!). And I understand they are trying to do the flag thing to show where it is at. But I kind of worry that it sounds like being locked into a state which may lower the control we have over it. So I wonder how it will go if I mark one state as a strategic objective, but then change it before the state is captured/lost. \n\nAlso kind of love the new naval stuff. Seems like the 3-5 quick naval invasions to get a foothold exploit will be gone :P I wonder if the fleets can more or less combine for that naval superiority. Would really suck if you have 3 invasions into a state and because one failed its considered done and over with all 3 or if that will be an effect of the naval formations. \n\nWhich I am loving the different everything for unit upgrades. Seems like being really able to customize your army to what you can support. Hopefully the AI can figure it all out xD",
                "Looks genuinely really great, I'm super impressed with the work all the devs have put into this. I've felt for a long time that Vic3 has the potential to be the best grand strategy game Paradox has ever released, it just needs some work to get it there; this feels like a huge step in that direction.",
                "These are decent changes, but 100 more are needed before the system can be considered good.  \n  \nFundamental issues such as  \n- Geography having no effect on warfare  \n- Logistics having no effect on warfare  \n- occupations having no economic effect (well, this is promised for sometime in the future)  \n- no ability to execute larger military strategies (e.g. Anaconda Plan, Schlieffen plan, etc.)  \nare still not addressed.  \n  \nA small step in the right direction, but it seems that many more updates will be needed.",
                "It\u2019s happening!",
                "Looks great! I hope that 1.4 and 1.5 finally push the game to where it should've been when it released",
                "Great job guys",
                "I really like those goals of Agency, Depth, and Graphics.\n\nFormations look really promising.\n\nThis looks like a huge step in the right direction.",
                "damn. victoria 3 actually becoming the perfect mix of paradox games like i've always dreamed of. I really hope they keep going in this direction!",
                "W Changes",
                "Wow!\nOn Paper the new system Sounds Great!",
                "3 week sprints huh? Must be nice \ud83d\ude09\n\nThese changes seem very impactful and directed, good job. Excited to see what this game look like when it\u2019s polished up a bit more.",
                "This is really promising stuff. Love it!",
                "I hope that in reality this ends up being as good as it sounds, that Paradox learn from it, and that players appreciate the huge effort that's gone into this!",
                "Thanks for working on the war system",
                "Absolutely great work, Devs. You guys clearly seem to care about the game and have put in the work to prove this fact double fold. \n\nI am very confident when I say that if you keep this up in two years, Victoria 3 will be the best paradox game by far.",
                "So fronts are effectively not fronts anymore given that battles can take place deep behind the front. It doesn't make sense. By the very definition, a front is where battles take place because that's the contact line between opposite forces. Having territory occupied in front of the front (no pun intended) just seems silly.",
                "Very excited about these developments!",
                "I couldn't be more excited for 1.5",
                "Wow I\u2019m pleasantly surprised. This sounds like great moves in the right direction.",
                "I love you guys and all that you do",
                "> For all of you out there that still use Old Reddit here is a link to this Dev Diary on our forum.\n\nHuge thanks for this (fairly minor) aid!\n\nresponding to the substance.\n\nI like the organization system of the beta feedback channels. Every time Eco (and sometimes Satisfactory) updates I'd check the discord or forum and wouldn't always see patch notes. Tracking user feedback and dev responses is also really helpful (for you as well, I imagine).\n\n> province captures\n\nSo I won't be able to gain partial occupation in more than one state in one battle? It fills on state and then starts the next? \n\n> formations\n\nFirst, I really appreciate the improvements to military UX. It's been very unpleasant so far. Condensing control to one menu is a godsend even before considering the other improvements. \n\nUnit types opens a *huge* door for army compositions based off of unit specialization. While it's clear you don't want the granularity of purpose seen in V2 or HoI4, there's still and interesting opportunity for balancing different stats in either jack-of-all-trade formations or highly specialized ones. If we can select a tactic that those formations use that takes advantage of certain units I start to get an Imperator 2.0 vibes (and that's really good!)\n\nFor example, if both sides of a front select only good attacking units (and a complementary tactic/doctrine) and tell them to advance, we'd see the see-saw frontline movements characteristic of the Eastern Front in WW1. If both sides select defensive units and tactics, we see the relatively static Western Front.\n\nLooking forward to naval reworks too. Navy in V2 (and most Paradox games tbh) was both interesting and daunting, I would like V3's navy to be more interesting even if it becomes a little more complicated)\n\nFinal thought:\n\nA successful rework here gives depth to the people who want it, while achieving the simplicity and ease for people who don't want to focus on it. The (relatively simple!) warfare systems in Crusader Kings 2 has pushed some of my friends away from their fun map-staring RPG. If Vicky3 lets people leave the warfighting mostly up to a (competent!) AI then it can expand the audience.",
                "Might finally play this game now, was waiting for a rework of war. Hopefully a naval rework soon as well.\n\nGlad Paradox realized they were bleeding money with the lack of warfare.",
                "Vic 3 update for my bday, not to bad",
                "Fuck yes I\u2019m so hyped for these changes , it\u2019ll finally bring some life into the military gameplay",
                "I like it, and it shows units on map, now if we can move the units during warfare that would be awesome",
                "Just port over HoI4's war system; it makes no sense to design a new front-based combat system when you have a successful one to start with. Restrict individual divsion/battalion micro if you don't want micro, but recognize that heads of state did micromanage armies during this time period. Perhaps not effectively (especially pre-telegraph), but they certainly tried. An order delay system based on tech/infra would be fantastic.\n\nLook at Abe Lincoln sitting in the telegraph office\n\n>On April 3, after he learned that McClellan had intended for Banks to be the covering force at Manassas Junction, Lincoln countermanded the embarkation of 40,000 troops under Union general Irvin McDowell for the Peninsula and instead held them near Fredericksburg. McDowell was named commander of the newly created Department of the Rappahannock. Lincoln reduced McClellan from general-in-chief to commander of the Army of the Potomac. He also created the Mountain Department for John C. Fr\u00e9mont. Unity of command was lost. There were now three independent departments between the Alleghenies and the Peninsula, **all of which reported to President Lincoln and Edwin M. Stanton, secretary of war**.\n\nWas that a good idea? Probably not, but leaving McClellan in charge wasn't getting much accomplished. \n\nHow about the Crimean war?\n\n>**Technology also helped the politicians to micromanage their generals**: the French commander in chief in the final months of the war, Gen. Jean-Jacques P\u00e9lissier, grumbled that he was ''at the somewhat paralyzing end of an electric wire'' the other end of which was controlled by Napoleon III. The emperor badgered him about high casualties and the dilatory progress of the siege, and urged him to defeat the Russians in open battle.\n\nAgain, it probably didn't help. Having Napoleon III in the field during the Franco-Prussian war wasn't useful either, but it certainly happened. Represent it with order delay based on travel time of information. Or just steal HoI4's planning bonus decay for manually microed units, that already works fine.",
                "This looks phenomenal! I've been holding off on playing since my first playthrough after release because the military was too frustrating and immersion-breaking, but this will get me hooked on the game going forward if it plays as good as it looks.",

                "With every Dev diary, stating that \"We are fixing things we fucked up\" is is always the same - initial jubilation from Paradrones, then after euhory fades, slow realisation that it is still applying cosmetics to a corpse. And when release day comes another uproar because broken foundation results in fundamentally broken mechanics.",
                "Has the Dev team lost their mind? This is headache inducing to read and is just spaghetti code on top of a fundamentally bad system. Shame.",
                "Once gain incompetent dev team proves that they have no understanding of why exactly people hate their dumbed down war system.  \nI hope Victoria 3 failure will teach Paradox to never ever implement mobile games' autowar mechanics to future games.  \nVictoria 3 corpse will serve as a reminder to never ever assign developers, who hated the prequel to make a sequel.",
                "Wow i hate it. the devs must not play the game, not even for 100hours.",
                "The customization options (especially the part how the name comes to be) really made me think about re-doing Stellaris in Victoria 3 - as in only recruiting armies made out of immigrants not from primary culture.",
                "Dude, these are massive changes. Can't wait for the next official patch release.",
                "If I had a suggestion about the economic part of the update, where can I put it so it is seen?",
                "i have read through this and am still unsure if any of this adresses the only  annoyance i have had  with the military system:\n\nincreasing the number of troops fighting at a specific front\n\nlet's say i have agroup of armies  fighting at the ontario front,  and i notice i need more troops there. \n\npreviously, i had to figurre out which general is commanding that army, then figure out what his HQ is, then figure out which states are in that HQ, and then activate constription centers  one by one.\n\nwill this be streamlined?",
                "Coming out of the/r/TotalWar subreddit this issue a breathe of fresh air.",
                "Very impressive changes - is it wrong that I desperately want them to use the little flag graphics for treaty ports as well?",
                "It's a small thing but even just being able to now name fleets and army groups is big for role playing and making the game feel more dynamic. Hope the ai eventually gets custom army names based on real world history or alternative political flavour",
                "this is really good.\n\nfinally, some of the people whining about the warfare in this game will fucking quit it.",

Submarines could play a major role in countering the Black Sea Fleet. \n\nFor land, it\u2019s the same thing like in the air and sea, soldiers, tanks, artillery, and vehicles will suffer HUGE losses but could theoretically overrun the entire Russian army.

                "Non Credible: you just gave them around 13 million men and the result of rampant wartime spending. MacArthur is gonna take a dump on Moscow.\n\nCredible: ok so the problem is that presumably, the US bois will have at least SOME fear for their own lives and aren\u2019t divine beings of wrath. Also tactics will need to be adjusted but I\u2019m assuming that will happen automatically by whatever being teleported them here for shits and giggles.\n\nUSAAC - fighters used for drone and helicopter swatting. Generally kept away from anything with a chance of ZU-23-2 fire or better. Bombers might be converted to drones with the power of college students and either rigged for suicide attacks or used for basically the world\u2019s most continuous drone drop raid. Ukraine may actually get air strikes if they can fit civilian radio and gps into the variety of strike fighters. \n\nSuicide rushing russian lines with massed attacks is a lot harder to accomplish when your enemy can kill with near zero chance of retribution. But also they can\u2019t kill any formation fast enough nor effectively enough to prevent damage, so a low level daylight raid  attacking all strategic assets in the AO would be effectively campaign ending. *That\u2019s a lot of planes and 1945 USAAC could accomplish that level of coordination.* and bomber command is no stranger to high attrition, so I could see it being surprisingly credible to suicide rush Russia.\n\nUSN - I\u2019m debating between calling them or USAAC the smallest contributors but I\u2019m gonna go with second smallest because Jesus fuck that is a lot of hulls. Also they have their own Air Force minus the strategic bombers so, same thing applies there. We are talking literally hundreds of warship hulls just appearing in the Black Sea. I don\u2019t think russia has the anti shipping assets in quantities to actually challenge this threat. There will be losses, yes. But they have nowhere to retreat to and a cornered animal is the most dangerous. Anywhere within 25km of the coast is effectively a bombardment zone and Russia\u2019s ability to stop this is to pray that Turkey does some legal fuckery and tells the US to take back their ships that somehow ended up here. Also, ice cream.\n\nUSMC - I do not think I need to explain why one of the most aggressive amphibious assault forces on the planet (in 1945) does not need an explanation. This is a lot of light infantry with some embedded armor, air, and artillery assets. Is an M1 Garand squad really gonna stand up to modern assault rifles? Not really, but they can dig trenches and suddenly it doesn\u2019t matter what you have, just that the Ukrainians have way more of it. Also I rate the chances of USMC \u201cinnovation\u201d as \u201cdangerously probable\u201d so get ready to see some fucked up shit on telegram.\n\nArmy - They have old armor but the guy with the tank usually wins. They have old guns but they have significantly more barrels and more ammo than they can fire through them. And they have infantry. A lot of infantry. They may struggle with armor if their embedded Ukrainian AT teams get taken out, but this is millions of soldiers we\u2019re talking about. And Russia absolutely does not have the infantry AT capability to guarantee probable success against the sheer number of tank squads. But the sheer mass of infantry and artillery will be completely overwhelming to Russia\u2019s defenses. Antiquated weapons and lack of body armor is not going to stop a 6:1 theatre numerical advantage from being a factor. Russia just cannot endure the level of fighting that will take place here. \n\nIf you\u2019re wondering why enemy armor isn\u2019t a concern for the marines, it\u2019s because they\u2019re marines and I do not need to reiterate how fucking terrifying marines are when bored or left to their own devices.",

They still remember all the lessons they've just learned, and logically, the soldiers in 1945 are the ones who have a habit of being alive at the end of battles.\n\nMassive, massive amounts of artillery as it was key to any offensive in WW2. Do you think the Russians have built defences equal in quality to the Westwall? Press X to doubt.\n\nMore tanks than the Russians will have anti-tank rounds to fire at them (this literally happened at Anzio to more than one 88 commander).\n\nDo they come with all the German prisoners, which are probably technically \"property\" of the army?

The Clevelands (and similar ships) had 12 152mm guns, which could fire every 4-5 seconds, with just as much accuracy. The Brooklyns, 15 of almost the same guns. The 8in cruisers can't shoot quite as fast but 208mm shells don't fuck around. The light cruisers alone would make up 450+ guns spread across at least 40-50 ships (too noncreditable to double check numbers), firing at a rate comparable to even the most modern artillery. Add in the 8in cruisers, the battleships ranging from 14-16in, and then all the fletchers, and we're talking about at least doubling the total artillery firepower of the Ukrainian armed forces.\n\nAlso, the US should totally buy back Enterprise, Pheonix, and at least one example of all the other major classes of cruisers still around in '45.

Equipment, logistics, and organization are chief among them.\n\nEquipment: The USAF didn't exist so sorry airplanebros. The Navy has more carriers than the Russian Navy has ships. But can the planes do plane things? Yes. Maybe not very good, but once a drunk American engineer figures out how to weld rocket engines to a Mustang every Su34 will magically fall out of the sky, and now carriers become fleet killers. What about Russian subs?! What about them? Anyways, the US Army standard rifle was the Garand, which, as we all know, is much better than any carbine rifle the Ruskies put out today. The rate of fire is on the Russian side, but I would say without a doubt the US Army of 45 has better experience and discipline with combat than the Russian Army of 2023. Doesnt matter how many shots you get off if they don't do their jobs. Armor from 1945 can be disregarded unless you want to give the Russians target practice. But shermans and wolverines would probably help train crews in tankery basics, freeing up many cold war tanks, previously used for training, to be sent to the front. Artillery is the big one. This war has been fought in duels between S-300s and Patriot systems since we sent them in. Now we have field guns and static batteries to pepper the Russian lines with. More artillery means offensives get kicked off quicker and more offensives happen at all. On top of all of that, the US Army was fielding 90 divisions by 1945 and therefore has a very huge pool of manpower, which the Russians do as well. But the US Army can move those troops around much easier than their opponents. And this leads to...\n\nLogistics: Any good general's favorite subject. As the cliche Chinese man said in his book about war, \"An army marches on its stomach.\" The Russian logistical train: less said means time saved. The US Navy is well supplied as long as they have the two ice cream ships. Which will of course also bring a morale boost for the new several thousand Ukrainian seamen and petty officers. The US Army 1945 logistical train: fucking magical. This brings hundreds if not thousands of trucks, jeeps, and trailers to the Ukrainians' disposal. They'll be looking for things to load onto trucks after just a week before they realize they've transported every shell and bullet to the frontline already. And those shitty dirt roads that bog down during the Rasputitsa? Yeah, no. Eisenhower will pave half the country by hand before he sees a single jeep need to be pulled out of the mud. And speaking of the general, here we now arrive at...\n\nOrganization: Somehow in the information age less contact is made with troops from field command posts or similar entities. The structure of the US Army is quite simple, with companies being deployed to combat relatively isolated from other companies, but also in radio contact with one another. Battalions are deployed for larger missions and are given a goal and told to get there their way. This is similar to how the Ukrainians fight, so I don't think this will be too revolutionary in the war. What will be a big change is the presence of a command system, which we of course all know doesn't exist in Russia. NCOs are unknown westoid cowardice technology in action, so I think a few good Sergeants and a few dumbass Lieutenants should do the job in most scenarios. If we're lucky they would bag a few higher-ups forced to visit the frontline to do their job of commanding.",
                "Considering the fact they\u2019re actually a competent force, it\u2019d probably help a lot even with their old equipment. Although they might struggle against more modern MBTs (but it\u2019s not like Russia has too many of those), but I\u2019d bet they\u2019d find a way to take them out. Plus since the Russian flagship failed to detect an incoming missile and its point-defense didn\u2019t activate, I think it\u2019d be safe to say most of the systems on the rest of the fleet aren\u2019t in great condition either, so warships with guns and torpedoes could likely get within range. As well American aircraft carriers from that time are still better than the Kuznetsov, and again with the non-functioning point defense, dive bombing could be viable.

The entirety of the west\u2019s armour production will have to be churning Kevlar out around the clock to get them all equipped by modern standards. \n\nIf Ukraine has enough anti-aircraft and anti-missile capabilities to defend or retrofit modern defences into the fleet, then taking Crimea will be incredibly easy in comparison as the naval bombardment will block out the sun, and all of a sudden the assets needed to perform a landing are available. \n\nThe USAAF and Naval Air Assets will likely eat up all of Russia\u2019s anti-aircraft missiles in a very short period of time. The casualties will be enormous, but this is war. \n\nAs mentioned, the availability of artillery will make everything a lot easier. The Russians will have all of their defences crushed. Why not simply clear a minefield with artillery? \n\nOh and the armoured units. I wouldn\u2019t want to use a Sherman in today\u2019s conflict.

Russia would lose SAM sites faster than they could replace them\n\nAdd in the marines and navy, Crimea is toast\n\nRussian morale is shit and if *millions* of Gung ho GIs showed up, they would be surrendering or running away in droves.",

                "OHHHH \n\nCAN WE HAVE A COMMUNITY POLL ON WHERE THE 2 NUKES GET TO DROPPED?",
                "Pretty big one.\n\nMore than anything let's look at the Navy. \n\nThe entire USN of 1945 in the black sea would be the largest concentration of naval force in human history.\n\nThats all 4 Iowa class ships for starters along with every other heavy cruiser and battleship at the time. Any moving object on the black sea coast would be obliterated. Railways, roads, depots, command posts, dockyards? Nothing but rubble. Zhukov would cream in his pants from beyond the grave at such a barrage.\n\nNow we get the carriers. I'm no expert as to how well modern naval and ground AA and jets can work against propeller planes but the force of all 99 carriers sending out their squads would probably be enough to sink whatever Russian ships are still around, hit inland targets and provide tactical support. Russia would have to scramble every plane from other bases and reserves to just handle the quantity. Especially when we toss in the army air force.\n\nThe Navy by Japanese surrender also had 372 destroyers. Slap some modern anti rocket gear, sea to land equipment or anything else and you can drown the Russians in constant shelling. Plus the quad mounted MGs are always badass. \n\nThere are also 230 submarines. I don't know the depth of the black sea but I will bet that this number of boats could pick up even a single Russian deciding to swim a bit far from the beach. \n\nOh and the ice cream ship. God bless the ice cream ship. Maybe the Ukrainians will convert it to a soup ship?\n\nAs for the army? Just having well over a million fresh bodies to fill in gaps behind the line would be a huge benefit. Have them work on rebuilding, demining, border guards, supply drivers, radio operators, all of that would free up manpower to put on the front or loosen the conscription laws. \n\nAnd watching the Marines that fought their way up to Okinawa assigned to land on Crimea would be a sight to behold.",

More than a million vehicles of various types - jeeps, trucks, and half tracks, many covered in various weapons. \n\nBillions of rounds of ammo, tons and tons of artillery, everything. Not all powerful stuff by modern standards , but lots and lots of it in good condition. \n\nMillions of men. \n\nThe people and supplies are the biggest advantage - the manpower and supplies are there to plug gaps and change outcomes. The amount of firepower brought to bear can stop any russian advance, and over time you can modernize the ww2 troops. You can rotate out many of your ukrainian troops for a bit, and then push them into assault roles. Your armor and planes aren't going to survive on the front, but they'll be useful in the rear as sheer mass. The artillery still throws explosives, the ships still float and shoot, the guns still chuck heavy bullets downrange. You'll probably want to exchange the SMGs for assault rifles and BARs for SAWs, but other than than that, it's an effective fighting force. You've got the manpower for naval invasions and deep offensives into occupied territory, the ammo and logistics for lots of weapons, etc. \n\nFinally, you have the endless waves of planes to threaten moscow itself. Nobody nowadays is prepared for a WW2 style endless wave of bombers. Sure, they'll die in spades, but you could glass moscow with 100k bombers starting from Kiev.",

                "I think the best approach would be to mix the 1945 US military with technologically modern units. WWII bombers could go absolutely insane in those numbers, but only with modern units clearing out air defenses ahead of them. A metal wall of Shermans would be a pants shitting nightmare for mobik infantry, but only if accompanied by modern armor and anti-air to take out threats greater than a conscript with an AK. The sheer volume of explosives the US navy could piss out would black out the sun, but modern anti-air and submarine hunters would be an absolute necessity to keep them afloat for long. Infantry units would be the only ones basically ready to go right out of the box, though probably still better used in conjunction with modern infantry. Modern radios and drone cameras would help quite a bit. \n\nAdditionally non-credible: redneck modifications could go a long way. How much more effective is a Sherman if you slap a Honda Civic back-up camera to the barrel? Hard to put a number on it but damn I sure would love to see it. \n\nAnd everyone else has already mentioned artillery good, so just team them up with some junior drone operators and let \u2018em go fuckin wild.",

                "Obviously, the WW2 USAF is fucked. They're not flying any missions without getting blasted out of the sky. My guess is a focus on transport and logistics from Europe to western Ukraine. The USN is also not very useful, as they lack modern anti-missile systems, and guns on ships are mostly out of date. The carriers are flying old aircraft too, so they're not particularly strong. they'd have to stick close to the coast and rely on ground air defense systems. I could see a situation where we figure out how to slap some air defenses on them and use them as escorts, but that's probably it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe US Army & Marines changes everything. The tanks would be middling at best, probably get a ton of ERA plates strapped on Ukrainian style (if they even have enough). They'd be treated as SPGs probably. The artillery... that would outnumber the Russian arsenals by something like 19 to 1. The overwhelming amount of artillery fire would be ridiculous. The anti-air assets would also find a new use against drones, though they'd probably be modified with electronics to make them accurate.  \n\n\nAnother important note is that there would be an influx of millions of soldiers, some of which would be very well trained and all of them having some experience in combat. With these numbers, it would be impossible for any Russian breakthrough with something like a 20 to 1 disadvantage in both artillery fires and manpower. Sure, they're worse equipped, but given how poorly the Russian offensive already went, this would be such a ridiculous boost in combat power that it would be impossible to even imagine the sort of advances we saw in reality.  \n\n\nI would also expect that there would be a very large aid package made up of random firearms to replace the Garands with something with a little more punch. The poor equipment would likely be replaced fairly quickly.  \n\n\nI would say something about the potential of counterattacks, but the biggest reason this doesn't really matter is simple: Ukraine wouldn't lose any more territory anyways!  \n\n\nSo yeah, the war would go VERY different.",

Basically doing a thunder run using modern infantry, tanks and vehicles by modern day ukraine accompanied by U.S infantry men under the cover of WW2 artillery bombings while the ukranian modern artillery can switch to more important targets. Theoretically if they used this battle doctrine they could probably reach the gates of Crimea within a week or two. By this time Ukraine could advance its Neptune and Harpoon, HIMARS and Storm shadows to hit the ships of the russian navy at sevastopol you could use the US NAVY for shore bombardment of Crimea for the incoming Ukranian/WW2 land forces.

                "Really, what this does is open up opportunities for the Ukrainians to use their best stuff better. Those flak guns for AAA batteries can shoot down a shahed well enough, same with those nets you can put around important stuff, allowing Ukraine to put their best anti air defenses where it would matter most for human lives and military success. Ukraine doesn\u00b4t have to worry about procuring knives, they can devote effort to a bunch of other stuff.\n\nAlso, the American fleet which is suddenly acquired by Ukraine for some reason should go and sail through the Turkish straits and blockade Russia\u00b4s other ports too and only allow whatever the Ukrainians feel they should let through like the minimum amount of oil necessary to supply the world but no more. Russia may have missiles but Ukraine now has a crap tonne of commerce raiding submarines and Russia has very little in the way of a lot of competent anti submarine capabilities, especially not against hundreds of submarines, especially if they go out hunting in wolf packs and wear down the Russian fleet or force it to remain in port and take defensive measures or be able to insert raiding parties all sorts of unexpected places and have to hold back troops Putin really cannot spare to keep watch and make it feel like not even St Petersburg is safe. \n\nOh, and go sink the yachts of the oligarchs or capture them and sell them off to raise money. Sinking the Moskva was a big dent in Putin\u00b4s pride, sinking most of the rest of the navy would force Russia to have to rebuild from scratch and make it much less able to threaten anyone in the future or do what their navy did to support Assad in Syria. And it could at least help protect the grain convoy and make Russian involvement in the negotiations irrelevant. Maybe they could help arm anti-Putin partisans in Russia en masse all throughout leaky borders, where the US made so many mortars, 105 thousand of them, that a team that fits in any ordinary Russian car can get one, set one up around some average base that isn\u00b4t expecting it, launch a few rounds from a couple km away, and leave in a minute and look like any other Russian car on the highway. A bazooka or an anti vehicle mine from WW2 will absolutely destroy a truck, you don\u00b4t need a javelin for that. All kinds of gear which could help you for that and be a nuisance Russia\u00b4s army absolutely cannot spare resources to deal with effectively. \n\nHaving that many more people to help also allows Ukraine to give long deserved breaks and shorten shifts to people, to reduce the burden on people. You can cannibalize things for gun barrels, tank barrels maybe, all sorts of spare parts, armoured vehicles that aren\u00b4t good enough for modern combat but is good enough to sustain your column on the march and to the frontlines where they can transfer to other vehicles that are better rather than needing to use a bradley or M113 behind the frontline, you can use American anti mine vehicles to clear minefields where they are having slow progress and the option to destroy them in places they wish they could but don\u00b4t have the resources to now. Huge quantities of ammunition and fuel, jerry cans, all sorts of stuff that lets Ukraine focus on other stuff or allows them to open fire on what they wish they could but can\u00b4t due to the risk of something irreplaceable being blown up or not having enough ammunition.\n\nSo many things this kind of support could offer them. WW2 was a scientific and industrial war, where the ability to resupply a country from attrition was the biggest factor, and Ukraine is certainly going to benefit from that kind of logistics chain and the projection powers involved here.",

Companies that contract with the military and department of defense regularly low ball estimates of the cost.  Once invested, the military is unwilling to cut the program short for fear of wasting all the so far invested money. They feel it's worth paying the extra money to make it the project succeed.\n   1. Companies do this on purpose.  The opaque nature of this business gives little accountability and doesn't show voters anything.\n   2. I would rewrite future contracts.  \"The company will provide these services within the specified budget.  Failure to provide these services will incur fines.  The burden of additional expenditures will be incurred by the company.\"\n2. Our military is constantly innovating with little thought to the current battlefield.  If the war in Ukraine has taught us anything, the big fancy weapons of today are vulnerable to hyper-accurate cheap rockets and drones.  It's misplaced value.\n3. The US military is one of the most capable in the world.  How much do we need to actually defend ourselves?  Looking at the budgets of comparable countries, I think we're spending too much to be the world's police for some reason.\n\nEdit:  Upon further reflection, I believe the problem is that these companies can donate money to politicians.

So they tried to stop it. Part of the military budget was officially given to other things. Welfare. FDA. The Wildlife Service. Etc.

The VA has what's called the [HUD/VASH Program](https://www.va.gov/homeless/hud-vash.asp) to address veteran homelessness. \n\nThere aren't Texas military medical facilities, per say. There are military hospitals at every major base (Bliss, Calvasos, and JBSA) and numerous VA medical centers and sometime they coexist, but the funding for both come from different places. It's all the federal government, but one is paid for with the defense budget and the other it's own separate budget. \n\nThe state has the Texas Veterans Comission and they also have a wealth of resources for vets in the state. \n\nedit a missed word",

Every veteran seen increases wait times for active duty members and there families. Should that change? Absolutely but funding needs to come and I guarantee thats not coming from the state of Texas. Additionally, many veterans do not have base access. So now they have to get passed armed guards trained to protect the base, during a crisis. What if they are on drugs? They should absolutely be helped, but base security is not trained or equipped to handle that. What happens when base security shoots and kills a veteran in crisis? Additionally, outside of big cities like San Antonio, many of the base hospitals are little more than clinics that dont have any 24/7 emergency or trauma care. Again due to funding. The base clinic at Laughlin AFB in Del Rio is not going to have the resources to assist. There are many possible solutions to this problem but relying on the military to solve it without additional funding is not the way to go.",

They don't pay attention and hold them accountable. \n\nBut it's not the *only* problem. I  worked with the homeless for years, and the VA does have housing for homeless vets, or programs to help provide housing. The problem is that a lot of people on the streets aren't there for long before developing problems with drugs and/or alcohol, and particularly people with PTSD. In fact, addiction might be the thing that put them on the streets in the first place. Maybe things have changed, but a couple of decades back those housing programs had very strict rules about drugs and alcohol, with basically a zero strikes policy. I helped people get into those programs, only to see them back at the shelter before too long because they got kicked out for being high or drunk. Apparently they didn't even have to be thst disruptive. I dealt with disruptive drunks and addicts all day long and didn't kick them out unless they got violent, but the VA didn't play that way. They just had to be visibly messed up. The VA would let them move in, tell them to go to 12-Step meetings, and that was about it. When that didn't work immediately (which it tends not to), they were given the boot.\n\nNow that part, unless it's changed, isn't something Texas could fix all by itself. VA's federal.\n\nBut this isn't just a veteran problem. *Nobody* deserves to live like that, in particular anyone with a serious mental illness, and if we could solve it for veterans we can solve it for everyone else out there. But that would involve supervised housing that isn't run like the people in it are on active duty. It would involve in-patient treatment for addiction be made available, and for free. And that couldn't all be 12-Step based, which doesn't work for a lot of people. Finally it would involve free healthcare *including* mental health care. And I don't mean Medicaid, because best of luck getting it, and then best of luck finding a provider near you.\n\nPoint being, there are solutions, but they require moving mountains.",
                "I don't really understand the question. If you think struggling Veterans should have better access to help, here are the things I can think of that you can do:\n\n1. Directly aid veterans that are in need. People you know or people your friends know Let them crash with you, buy them stuff, if they're homeless let them use your address, etc etc. Get them in touch with aid agencies and other people that can help.\n\n2. Help people helping veterans. Donate time, money, or goods to organizations that are doing that. Wounded Warrior project is one example.\n\n3. Work to elect politicians who will prioritize helping veterans. If you think an incumbent politician is not doing enough, work to oust them either in the primary or general election, whichever seems more likely.\n\nThe party that has controlled the Texas state government for the last quarter-century has, to my knowledge, never made veteran care a priority, choosing instead to prioritize overturning restricting the right to bodily autonomy and privacy through attacks on abortion as red meat to get evangelical votes, and an aggressively anti-worker pro-business set of economic policies. The general trend has been to cut government aide programs like the one you're describing, so I don't think supporting that party's continued occupation of the reigns of power is going to benefit veterans.",

It's also that we got used to having so many contents so to go from that to no content or 2-3 content per these times is too much of a change ><\n\nYoongi also has been like the most active doing all sort of activities from releasing music to suchwita to interviews to collabs to world tour and doing live here and there, photoshoots,.. Etc, it will be hard to get used to him not releasing anything...",

                "I\u2019m curious about Namjoon. I honestly thought he will enlist after he finished the promotions of indigo. He mentioned on Suga\u2019s concert that is the last time he was performing on a stage, but also mentioned he is not enlisting soon. \ud83e\udd14",
                "Yoongi and jungkook are the members who recently interacted the most with fans, them leaving suddenly ( i mean in the future for JK) will probably hit me the most \ud83e\udd79",
                "Time passes anyway. \n\nYoongi gave us so much material to hold on to and cherish while we wait. Honestly he's a mad man with a solid schedule to announce this just after his last concert date. \n\nSeeing him put so much passion in what he does, it kind of makes me want to use this time to improve as well.. does it sound strange? I know I'll still like his music, I've loved it since a lovely cypher reached my ears some seven years ago, in comparison what's 2025? \n\nFuture's gonna be okay!",
                "I've felt more than I've felt in the past year or so since this announcement and I don't know what to do with the flood of emotions and tears right now.\u00a0\n\n\nA little bg context: I've only properly delved into BTS since the past two months but I've literally consumed more about/from them than many would have in years. And while I love their group dynamic, their passion, their early works; for me what really drew me in was seeing/hearing about the life and works of Min Yoongi. I don't think I can call myself an Army, or even a solo stan, because for me it's more about a life altering sense of feeling seen than anything else. And for that I don't have words enough to thank the man.\u00a0\n\n\nFrom his lyrics, to his persona, his mental health issues and his sense of isolation - it has been such a visceral representation of my own struggles so far...(TW) to the point of having suicidal tendencies and acting upon them a couple of times. And the recurring cycle of psychological demons...where currently they've almost taken over my personal and (now non existent) professional life. In this headspace finding his songs, his lyrics that that spoke of his struggles, his reflections, his pain and most importantly his decision to power on - that has had me thinking that maybe I can too let go of my debilitating procrastination and achieve what I know I am capable of achieving. And as a soon to turn 35 yo woman, let me say it's not a joyride feeling your life being in shambles. So to have his work slowly guide me towards a mental state of action, and then having this indecision now when I will hear him/his work again has left me in a kind of sobbing mess.\u00a0\n\n\nI've never felt so deeply connected with a celebrity's work and life story as him and that's surprising for me since I don't really idolize pop culture celebrities. But witnessing everything he has done these past few months, these past few days and ever since he debuted - it has been such a blow to the solar plexus, in the most intense and enriching way.\u00a0\n\n\nSo to now be unsure of what future holds for/from him, makes me really heavy hearted. It would be amazing to see him and his group reunited and perform soon, please don't doubt that. But for me, I long to have his seething, soothing, soul touching presence in my life. And being uncertain of when and if that will happen...tears are pouring out as I try to put in words what that makes me feel.\n\n\nAnyway sorry for the long, rambling read. I generally wouldn't have posted it but it felt too painful to keep inside myself. Telling myself I've got this, and I've got his words to power me through (hopefully). Gwaenchanh-eul geoeyo.\u00a0",

At the same time, they will be used for re-filling Federal Armed Forces stocks for items delivered to Ukraine as well as for Germany\u2019s contributions to the European Peace Facility (EPF), from which costs incurred from providing military assistance to Ukraine can be re-imbursed to EU member states. https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-en/news/military-support-ukraine-2054992\n\nScholz said that Germany would provide Ukraine with over $19 billion [\u20ac17 billion] in weapons over 5 years\n>Scholz said the calculations begin from 2022, when Russia launched its full-scale invasion, and track projected spending until the year 2027.\nhttps://kyivindependent.com/scholz-germany-to/\n\nLet\u2019s do the maths!:   \n\u20ac17 billion budget: \u20ac2 billion spent in 2022 and \u20ac5,4 billion planed to be spent in 2023.  \nSo only \u20ac9,6 billion (\u20ac10,5 billion according to the website of Germany\u2019s gov.) can be spent until 2027.: => \u20ac3,2 billion (or \u20ac3,5 billion?) annually in 2024, 2025 and 2026.   \nSo I think that Mr Lindner\u2019s promise (5 billion Euros in annual military aid until 2027) isn\u2019t accurate! \n\nI suppose that it is even less than \u20ac17 billion from 2022 until 2027.:\nAs stated on the website of Germany\u2019s gov., same funds would also be used for re-filling Germany\u2019s Armed Forces stocks for items delivered to Ukraine. Germany\u2018s defence minister had said that the amount would be 4 billion Euro.",

                "Warehouse One on Kadena. Back when I was on swings some months back, I was heading to the pilf cage with another airman in my shop so we could put away the knives and shit that needed putting away. Since swing shift was slow as fuck, and we had a lot of bulky shit, we were just gonna out it in the pilf cage, go to lunch, and sign it all in when we got back.\n\nAs we're both walking up to the door, we hear scurrying footsteps behind us in the corner of the warehouse, leading to where TMO inbound usually works. We both look back and stare at nothing while we track the footsteps continuing to the dark corner of the warehouse before finally stopping. Mind you, our warehouse has motion sensor lights, and nothing came on. You can bet your sweet ass we left got our asses back to the office and didn't go back in the warehouse unless we had to.\n\nAlso, earlier that night, our NCOIC and one of our NCO's, Filipino and Samoan, respectively, were talking about ghost stories from back home. Said NCOIC also heard some weird sucking and slurping noises coming from somewhere in the office but couldn't figure out where it was. Couple those with the other airman hearing a shriek in the warehouse, we spent the rest of that week traveling in pairs in that place.",
                "Not mine story, not even sure if it\u2019s real but it\u2019s a fun one:\n\nThere was an airman in the dorms at some base, idk which. Good airman, never any issues. He was Hispanic and very religious, and that demographic takes ghosts and spirits very seriously.\n\nWell apparently, this airman started showing up to work late, messy, out of regs, and performing poorly increasingly over the course of a few weeks. He had a good track record, so at first his supervisors were giving him the benefit of the doubt but it went on too long and got too frequent that they had to talk to him about it. He said nothing, didn\u2019t explain what was going on, just basically sat there and let the supervisors talk to him. Well, this behavior continued, more and more to the point where he started getting in trouble. LOCs, getting chewed out, you know the usual. However this didn\u2019t deter his behavior and it only kept getting worse, and finally, they encouraged him to go to mental health, he did, and they found out that this airman fully, truthfully in their mind, thought their dorm room was haunted.\n\nThe mental health clinic did not think the airman was lying, (at least the airman fully believed that there was 100% a ghost in his form) but obviously there\u2019s no ghost right? So clearly he has a mental health issue going on. They eventually had to move to separate this individual for his \u201cpsychosis\u201d  and poor work performance and standards upkeep. He was a good airman, and they didn\u2019t want to, but they had to. \n\nWell, shirt comes to the dorm to help move the airman out, and goes into the dorm closet to help get all his stuff. Shirt looks up at the ceiling, and in a vent, no shit he sees a face staring back at him through the vent. Shirt absolutely shits himself. Low and behold, an airman who had gone AWOL was literally living in the fucking walls of the dorms building, and would particularly use this airman\u2019s dorm to go to the bathroom, stretch out, whatever. \n\nSo airman #1 would be laying in bed and literally hear another person crawl from out of the wall, out of their closet and nonchalantly waltz into his bathroom and back into the wall on a regular basis. No fucking shit he thought his dorm was haunted, especially considering his background. \n\nAirman #2 (the ghost) was removed from the base and airman #1s health improved and was able to stay in the Air Force.

But I mentioned I usually slept on my love seat which was perpendicular to my bed.  They mentioned how that wasn't ideal compared to my bed.  I blew it off.  Having grown up Catholic all I thought to do was to not pay it any mind.\n\nEither later that night or shortly there after, I remember being asleep in my love seat and having this huge sense of someone watching me and standing over me.  Like how you feel when someone is looking at you when you are stopped at a traffic light, or when someone is behind you to surprise you and you can feel their presence.\n\nMy room was pitch black and I could not shake this feeling.  I got legit scared and figured the best thing to do was to clench my eyes closed as tight as possible.  That didn't work in getting the presence away so I decided to open my eyes and look in the direction in which I felt like someone was standing there.\n\nI shit you not, as clear as I am typing this out 14 years later, there was a white face up in the corner of my dorm room looking down at me.  I about shitted myself and immediately went back to clenching my eyes as tight as I could.  I waited a few minutes with the blanket over my head (fuck you), and then decided to walk over to the light switch, eyes closed, to turn on the lights.  I did and saw nothing, thankfully.\n\nI think I stayed up the rest of the night with the lights on just bullshitting on my laptop and playing MW2 on the PS3.  It was night time so at least the shitty internet bandwidth was tolerable.\n\nAll these years later and this is still the most frightened I've felt in my life.

The room stank occasionally of Methane, but had no discernible source, then nearly 3 days before I was released, I woke up in the middle of the night, cold.

There are no lights on it and only can really determine the shape by seeing which stars get blacked out. Watch it for a few minutes till it goes out of sight.

In a group that small, stuck together for 9 months (at least, 13+ with others), you get to know everyone by the way they wear their clothes, their walk, you can figure out who someone might be from a distance based on where they are and when, etc. Being the engineer, I knew just about all the passageways and emergency exits and also knew who was on rounds during what week, etc. \n\nMy office was in the power plant and I was walking out to our water well (called the rodwell). It was dark (always dark in the winter), moonless and probably -80\u00b0s. The best way to navigate is to just turn off your light, let your eyes adjust, and try not to fall over. As I'm walking I hear the clunk of a hatch on an emergency exit from our utilidor open, then I see someone climb out and start walking the direction of our RF facility (another 1/2 mile) and then off station. At the time, there are maybe 4 people who this could have been, 2 women and 2 guys. It was definitely a man, and definitely NOT the one who was \"Fat Bob\", I hollered and got no reply, which isn't that unusual, sound can travel weird out there and with the hoods pulled up and the wind hearing can be super directional. I just completely didn't recognize the person, but didn't think much of it at the time. Checked the boiler in the rodwell and went back to the galley to get some coffee and the ONE PERSON I thought it could have been was sitting in there and hadn't been on rounds. I checked on some other people and radioed out to RF and no one had been there. Not sure it's a \"ghost\" story but still a complete freaky mystery that I still think about almost 20 years later.\n\nedit: we speculated that if it were a ghost it could be the ghost of [Rodney Marks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_Marks) since after he died his body was kept in the fuel arch which would be accessed through the utilidor or [Casey Jones](https://www.southpolestation.com/trivia/history/casey.html) who was killed in a place called \"the blue room\"... adjacent to the fuel arch.",

I had quite a few experiences there before eventually living in the building\u2026\n\n-While working, I would hear what sounded like a group of people talking upstairs while everyone was in class. When I would walk up there, it would be empty. This happened three times.\n\n-Scariest thing was working a 12 hour night shift, the building was empty except for the third floor. It was my friend, \u201cC\u201d & I at the front desk. I decided I was going to walk down one of the empty hall ways to look around. I had an overwhelming feeling of being watched. Halfway down the hall, C called me to come to the lobby & as I got back in the lobby, it sounded like a box with items fell from the hall I just came from. Which is impossible because the rooms were completely empty besides the furniture. I freaked out & we turned to the hall & a white mist shot out of the hall & up to the ceiling. I decided to take a photo of the hall & captured a white figure in the door frame. Right after I caught this on photo(no longer have the photo), our friends from G bay called & said they saw a male figure of a TI, with the hat, in the door frame & asked us if someone came by. No one was there.\n\n-When I was finally in training, I ended up living in this building. We lived on the bottom floor of F bay, left hallway as you enter in the female bay. My room mate and her friend came by to talk to me about ghosts. \u201cP\u201d had the idea to record on her phone and ask if any ghosts wanted to talk to us. In a males voice (no males are allowed in the female bays), it said my last name. I was terrified! Right as we listened to this voice, my room mates clothes fell out of the wall locker. Which we had been in the room for over an hour at this point, never touching or going near the clothes. \n\n-After we heard the voice, on multiple occasions in our room, we felt a presence. We witnessed on two occasions our chairs slide out from under the desk, my reflective belt flying into the middle of the floor, & I got woken up by a white flash in front of my face. \n\nWe heard stories of a girl who went crazy in F bay, there was a cork board with creepy drawings hung up in the room that the rumors claimed were hers.

Suddenly in my right-hand peripheral vision I notice what looks like a person, but they were all shadowy. This figure approached me pretty quick, so I turn and look to see who is walking up on me as I didn't hear any doors open. My head turned right at the moment they would have been right by my shoulder, but it disappeared as soon as I would have been able to look at them. Needless to say I took a bit of a break after that.\n\nAnother time, I was in a storage building with one of my Airmen. We were loading a van up with equipment from one of the rooms by walking it through the entrance door. We both walked past an office chair multiple times. On our third or fourth trip back in, the office chair was suddenly right in our path. There was no way for the wind to push it, so I asked if he had moved it, to which he said no. I push it out of the way again and we finish loading with no issues. We were both just so baffled about how it moved.\n\nOne of the Airmen I worked with also had an incident in that building. He went in to grab some consumables to restock the supply in our support section. With this building, the lights at the front turn on with switches that are a good ten feet past the entrance, and the back half turn on using the breaker box in the middle of the building. He said that when he was walking to the breaker box, the lights in the front half just shut off.

Right after fundies at Shepard a few of us in tech school did our follow on training for AWACS at Tinker. They moved us to the training dorms before we graduated and into the permanent party dorms. We lived in loop hall for for I think 3 months if I can remember correctly.\n\nA lot of back story so bear with me, loop hall was 3 stories tall and. The bottom floor didn\u2019t have any dorms and had a door to the airmen\u2019s club in the building called the late lounge. The second floor was we\u2019re all the tech schoolers were if you walked to the left there were single dorms connected by a bathroom and to the right were double rooms. The third floor was under maintenance and the only people who would be there would be the NCOICs for the weekend to watch over the tech schoolers for the weekend. \n\nBecause my class got there later we had to double up in the double rooms. Often time my roommate would stay up late and watch TV and around 3 o\u2019clock in the morning he hears some tapping coming from the room next door. I\u2019m passed out at this moment because we have class the next day. My roommate attempts to go to bed but this tapping keeps going on. He texts our classmate in the room he\u2019s hearing the tapping from to try to get him to stop. Right after he sends the text our classmate responds with \u201cI was just about to ask you to do the same\u201d \n\nThat same classmate had another run in with something knocking on his door. It was the weekend and he was watching TV when he heard a knock, he opened the door and no one was there. That whole thing happened a few more times. So much so that at one point he stood right behind the door and when he heard the knock he flew open the door to find no one there. \n\nI was the green rope, (it\u2019s ok to roll your eyes) and one of my responsibilities was to make sure that everyone signed a paper saying that they were in for the night and weren\u2019t leaving. Because of our class we had to do a split schedule between the two separate groups. One worked swings the other some worked days and after that week they would flip. Around 2200 I went down stairs to make sure everyone signed the curfew paper. My. Roomate and the two classmates next door were using the Wi-Fi from the airmen\u2019s club to play video games. I was only out of my room for at most a minutes. When I got back up to my room everything was open. Doors, closets, shelves, the microwave, the refrigerator, everything was opened. Because this was a double room we had double everything minus the kitchen stuff. I went right back downstairs and hung out until everyone else went to bed. \n\nA few weeks later and everyone graduated and we moved into the permanent party dorms. I stayed in my first room for about 2 years until my AC unit blew up and my floor became a swamp. They moved me into the dorm just behind it looking at the track. From day that place gave me the creeps. \n\nAt first it was just so nicknaks on my shelves that would be moved slightly or pictures moved. I didn\u2019t think much of it because Oklahoma gets earthquakes. But at night, I\u2019d always hear movement in my closet. Just stuff being moved around I wasn\u2019t a fan of that. I was able to survive that by just having my TV on and hoping nothing weird happened. There would be times when I\u2019d wake up or close my eyes and feel like something was watching me. \n\nThe thing that still makes the hairs on my neck stand up was when I was getting ready for work one morning. I worked day shift so I was up at about 4 am to get ready. I started the shower and went to go sit on the toilet. When I was on the toilet I saw this black mass come through the door and walk right past me. I washed the pits and the boys and I got out of there. That was horrible. \n\nTL;DR Tinker is haunted",
                "Not on a military base, but my apartment in Germany was haunted. Candles would be found lit when I got home that I know I didn\u2019t light, shower would turn on in the middle of the night and I\u2019d have to get up to turn it off. This was around the time Xbox Kinect or whatever was popular and my Kinect would pick up phantom players. One time my wife at the time had the dance game paused, it unpaused itself and started racking up points on the dance game she was playing. I would also have really bad night terrors and sleep walk a lot.

We would inhabit these spaces a couple times a year for exercises when I was supporting the 353rd SOG (now a wing) at Kadena.  One of the buildings had a command center with a big front area with screens and stadium-like seating all around it in a half-moon.  Many of the lights were out and it was super creepy.  One night, one of my troops and I were in there just poking around because we were bored and all the lights turned off.  We went to leave, using just the light from our phone and we heard a door shut from wayyyy in the back of the building.  It was an interior door as the only entrance / exit was one blast door that we had come through.  We froze and not 5 seconds later we just heard muffled sobbing coming from the pitch black.  It was coming from one of the rooms at the top of the stadium seating.  We fuckin booked it out of there and smoked a cigarette near the entrance.  We ended up getting on the radio and having one of our guys bring some coffee and we just sat there drinking coffee and smoking for like 2 hours.

Immediately the hair on the back of my neck stood up, I went in, closed the door, and called out to who I thought was there. Silence. You can bet your ass I grabbed a broomstick and started walking through the building, checking the rooms. I even went out the back door to see if he was walking out, or at the smoke pit or something.

                "Couple of years ago I worked at a site in the middle of nowhere MD. It is a cross shaped building, with 4 bays (each bay having its own respective purpose). On one of the bays with all the offices there was an upstairs with old dorm rooms and a little closet we turned into a library (it was like 8 bookshelves with random books and old T.O\u2019s from the 70s-90s). I worked panamas and went up the library to look at the books at about 5 o\u2019clock. \n\nEverybody except for a cable dog in the bay across from the one I\u2019m in, left the building to go grab some grub and had been gone for maybe like 15 minutes at that point. Anyways I walk up the stairs in the library and start browsing. I see a book (which look interesting at the moment) marked \u201cGENOCIDES\u201d\u2026 the second I touch that book, i am comforted by four very distinct knocks (like knocking on a door but just enough for me to hear) on the wall right in front of me through the bookshelf. I freeze, turn 90 degrees look into the hall and just say \u201cHello?\u201d. I walk my ass into the hallway and look both ways. All the doors were shut to the rooms EXCEPT for the bathroom right next-door. The stall that was right in front of the bookshelf was wide open but had unbroken caution tape in front it. \n\nSo I started walking to the stairs and feeling really groggy for some reason. As soon as I took the first step down the stairs i heard two muffled footsteps behind me and the feeling that someone was staring at my back. So I flipped around, no one there and then I proceed to barrel back down the stairs like a 5 year and back into the office I was in. When I felt like I could get back up, I went over the the cable dude and found him absolutely passed out, dried drool on his chin, with a YouTube video on and his earphones in. \n\nApparently I wasn\u2019t the only one with these experiences there.

I let the person I worked with know that someone was walking around our vehicle and we did a quick sweep of the area. We didn\u2019t find anyone around us nor did we find any sign that someone was walking around us. So we took it as a sign to get the fuck out of there and find another place to chill.\n\nI learned later on that it was common knowledge that security bill was haunted as shit.

I assumed it was our MSGT doing walk arounds and said hi to him only to get no response. the footsteps stopped after i said hi, then resumed a few seconds after. I was weirded out by that, so I went down there to see if it was him and there's nobody.

Nothing happened for months after that. Then it happened one more time and that was it. On a bored weekend me and a buddy went to the museum to check it out. There was a volunteer who worked the museum since it opened off base and got to talking to him. He was on the base when Hap Arnold was base commander. As old timers do he told us about the history of the base and part of the conversation was about the tb housing and where it was. Then it clicked.

                "Story time:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBack when C5s were going through the AMP upgrades (2009/2010) we had an expediter who would tell Airmen ghost stories of stuff hes seen on the flightline working mids while he was driving them out to the flightline to drop them off by themselves and freak them out. He did this to me and a buddy of mine once and it resulted on the cops getting called out, but I am getting ahead of myself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf any of you have ever been on a C5 in the dead of night when the wind is up will understand how freaky it can be. The aircraft makes a lot of fun noises while its flexing in winds and it causes the imagination to run crazy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter this expediter dropped me and my buddy off, we did what most maintainers do; we started our safety walk around. I elected to do the outside of the aircraft and my buddy did the inside. My buddy is generally pretty level headed and doesn't ping too often. However, as I was transitioning underneath the T-Tail and moving to inspect the other side of the aircraft, I hear a loud scream coming from inside the cargo bay. Freaked out, I started running towards the crew stairs, thinking my buddy had fell or something.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, before I continue, I need to paint a picture for you in case you don't know what it is like inside of the cargo bay in the middle of the night on a C5. You can't see anything. Anything you can see if only illuminated by the flashlight you have to use. Towards the back of the cargo bay are more stairs that lead up to the troop compartment where passengers will sit during transport, and on the right side of the top of the stairs is a metal grate that loadmasters will use to look down into the cargo bay during flight. Got the picture in your head now? Lets continue.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBefore I could reach the crew stairs, my buddy comes running down, eyes wide, completely freaked out. I asked him if hes ok. He proceeds to tell me that while he was inspecting the aft section of the cargo bay, he heard a small whine coming from the top of the troop stairs. It isn't super uncommon for animals to sometimes get on the aircraft and hide. Hearing this, he transitioned is flashlight towards the top of the troop stairs and waved it right to the metal grate at the top to see if he could find what was making the noise. According to him, he did. He claims he saw a man with red eyes, standing above the grate staring down at him menacingly and breathing with a whine. He screamed, dropped his light, and ran back to the front of the aircraft and down the crew stairs. I, of course, didn't want to go onto the aircraft so we called the cops and they did a full sweep of the aircraft and couldn't find anything. My buddy was sent home that night and, in the future, decided that he was just seeing things. I have seen some crazy stuff on the flightline, and I elect to believe that he actually saw something supernatural.",

The Philippines wouldn't also be alone in enforcing mandatory military service, as neighboring Taiwan, Vietnam, South Korea, and Singapore have such policies in place.\n\nBut there are a few roadblocks the PH government would need to address before implementing mandatory military service:\n\n1. Budget constraints: Training millions of Filipino men (and women, if the service will include women) will cost the PH government a lot. Many rich countries like Taiwan and South Korea can afford to implement mandatory military service because, you guessed it, they're rich. But the Philippines is not, and the DND would require billions of pesos of funds to properly implement military service.\n\n2. Possibility of abuse within ranks: Mandatory ROTC was abolished because an ROTC cadet was murdered after revealing corruption within his university's ROTC program. If abuse and corruption can already happen in ROTC, what more mandatory military service that will include everyone? Even South Korea had issues with abuse within their own mandatory military service, which was also tackled by series like D.P.\n\nFeel free to add more.",

We only spend approx 1% of GDP on defense, NATO recommends 2%, the US spends 3.4%. \n\nFor the Chinese threat on the WPH, what we need is not conscription. We need a ton of maritime/coastal patrol aircraft, anti-ship defenses, ships that can pose a credible threat to Chinese vessels that regularly traverse the WPH.  P-3 Orions, P-8 Poseidons, ATR-72 ASW, MBDA Exocets, RGM-84 Harpoons, BrahMos, not more grunts with rifles.",

For example, China took its nine-dash line claim from Taiwan, and the country with the most installations in the region isn't China but Vietnam.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. is arming Taiwan but appeasing China by stating that it won't recognize Taiwanese sovereignty, and trying to sell arms to Vietnam, whose military ally is Russia.",

Mind you that they have PH partners, and these Chinese may think that the PH is also doing harm against their own kind.\n\nThink of it this way na yung Pinay na na-recruit ng PH firm and killed/harassed in the Middle East, syempre galit tayo sa middle east niyan. So put that in the perspective of the Chinese. \n\nFor sure its a Chinese to Chinese crime, but it happened in the PH, and there's a PH partner firm, so the narrative may be a different.\n\n(Are we the baddies here?.

                "    Key Findings\n    \r\nTaiwan is vulnerable to defeat by China within 90 days\n    \r\nThe authors identify four key variables for evaluating a country's capacity to resist a high-end attack: political leadership and social cohesion, military effectiveness, durability (i.e., the ability to manage and sustain the economic and human costs of conflict), and military intervention by an ally.\n    \r\nFor insight into Taiwan's capacity, analysts should pay close attention to the quality and strength of Taiwan's political leadership and the degree of social cohesion in the lead-up to a crisis or conflict. The other variables should be regarded as of secondary importance.\n    \r\nEven though Taiwan has fewer armaments and troops than China does, that does not doom the island to defeat. However, even if Taiwan's military dramatically improves its combat-effectiveness, China's military advantage will likely continue to grow because of China's enormous resource advantage.\n    \r\nThe impact of severe casualties and economic loss likely would cut two ways in a major war. Initially, Taiwan's public probably would rally around the national leadership and favor resisting an aggressive China. However, over the long term, heavy costs of conflict likely would erode public support for continuing the war.\n    \r\nBecause of Taiwan's military disadvantages and low durability, successfully withstanding a large-scale Chinese attack would require military intervention by the United States. A well-led and socially cohesive Taiwan might be able to mount a determined resistance for a long time, but, without a robust U.S. military intervention, China's enormous advantage in military resources likely would allow it to eventually subjugate the island.",
                "The part I never understood on this debate is what is China\u2019s game plan is for a rapid amphibious invasion of an entire island without the other side noticing. In the buildup to the invasion there is no way to go undetected. You just need such a massive buildup of ships and logistics. Ships are hard to hide from satellites. They are also hard to quickly replace. Even if China is willing to sacrifice every last soldier, those soldiers will be standing on the shore of mainland China and their intense patriotism won\u2019t get them across the straits. On the defensive, Anti-ship missiles and submarines are easy to conceal and will turn those straits into a ship graveyard.",
                "Invasion has always been contrary to china's interests regardless whether they can actually conquer the place... Hence their long term (unchanged) policy of seeking diplomatic reunification. \n\nNationalism is a hell of a drug. People don't like being subsumed against their will. Not to mention the general diplomatic and economic consequences. \n\nI maintain my view that the only thing that will make China invade (or more likely blockade) is external actions such as a declaration of independence or a radical change in US posture... Unfortunately something that seems more likely by the month.\n\nTaiwan is far more useful as a vehicle for political messaging than as a rebellious province and source of international reprisals, especially given the supreme importance the CCP give to internal stability.",
                "idk. we also thought the Afghanistan police force would resist the taliban for at least six months, but it actually only took 2 weeks",
                "I just can\u2019t see China ever doing it, but then I never thought Russia would actually invade either. \n\nAssuming they\u2019re able to win a lightning total victory in five days, what then? I think this is an aspect of discussion often neglected despite its immense importance. \n\nThe west will almost certainly cut all trade ties with China and issue severe sanctions. This alone will be a significant blow to Chinas already slowing economy. \n\nThe ASEAN bloc has long been pragmatic toward China, but how will they react to a naked power grab by the bully next door? If Vietnam aligns itself closer with the US to protect its interests in the South China Sea, the US could cut off most of Chinas ocean going trade while staying out of missile range. Thailand has close relations with the US military as well and could add further complications to Chinese interests. \n\nThat leaves land trade as Chinas only remaining option. They\u2019ve invested a lot into the Silk Road, but it\u2019s still in its infancy.  Russia is also not the power it used to be, and without their military might the CSTO will no longer be able to keep a lid on central asia tensions. Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan are a great example of lingering tensions. China has invested over billions of dollars in the later. All those investments still be viable and functional? And then there was the Russian intervention into Kazakhstan to prop up an unpopular dictator. What if the next time there\u2019s a revolt, a more pro western government takes over? In short, if China wants to shift its trade to inland routes, they\u2019ll also need to take over police action in the area to ensure stability. Will they be able to do this while also occupying Taiwan? \n\nLastly, there\u2019s the question of the Indian response to a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. They also have lingering border disputes. If India joins the West, the China will be fully boxed in and stuck with just Russia as an ally. And even if India maintains a neutral middle ground response, they may take the opportunity to seize more territory in the Himalayan, further straining Chinas military. \n\nHaving sat and thought this out, my conclusion is that even in the event of a swift Chinese victory, the damage and isolation will be so great as to make it a potentially final Pyrrhic victory for the CCP",
                "It's hard to take these type of articles seriously...  If a direct military conflict breaks out between China and Taiwan, it's not likely to last 90 days and the longer it persists the more favorable it is for Taiwan.  Contrary to some people's views, China won't and doesn't have \"unlimited bodies\" they can throw in to the effort until they prevail.  A direct military attempt to take the island isn't likely to look like D-Day or even Okinawa, it will be fairly unique to this particular situation.  If China goes this route, which is certainly possible and if so likely sooner than later, they will have a plan and it will either succeed or it won't.",
                "So if we assume China is able to win a  total victory in 90 days, what happens then? I think this is an aspect of discussion often neglected despite its immense importance. \n\nOn the Island itself, I would expect at least low level\nGuerrilla warfare for several years at the least. Taiwan has a clear separate identity from China at this point and they\u2019re horrified at what happened in Hong Kong. No promises by the CCP will ever be trusted, and a large military garrison will likely be needed for a long time. Don\u2019t forget that Taiwan is incredibly mountainous and rugged, making it an ideal place for partisans to operate. \n\nThe West could of course always decide not to intervene, impose light sanctions, refuse to recognize Chinas claims, but in reality all but lay down and take it. \n\nHowever, I think this is very unlikely and the west will almost certainly at least cut all trade ties with China and issue severe sanctions. This alone will be a significant blow to Chinas already slowing economy. \n\nAnd if the US intervenes and suffer casualties, will they simply give up once China controls the island? Imagine a scenario where China invades, the US navy races to intervene, but are forced to pull back after an entire carrier group is sunk by Chinese missiles. Taiwan tries to resist alone, but is overwhelmed with its government collapsing when New Taepai falls. This might sound ideal to Chinese leaders, but the US would still have enough naval strength to maintain a blockade out of missile range. If some of Taiwans government escapes, this could go on almost indefinitely. The amount of rage and anger US citizens would feel about such losses would demand this response at the very least. \n\nAnd then there\u2019s the ASEAN bloc who have long been pragmatic toward China, but how will they react to a naked power grab by the bully next door? If Vietnam aligns itself closer with the US to protect its interests in the South China Sea, the US would have an easily supplied choke point on most of Chinas ocean going trade while staying out of missile range. \n\nThat leaves land trade as Chinas only remaining option. They\u2019ve invested a lot into the Silk Road, but it\u2019s still in its infancy.  Russia is also not the power it used to be, and without their military might the CSTO will no longer be able to keep a lid on central asia tensions.

                "If the US were able to defend South Korea, they have even better chances to do same with Taiwan, island is easier to defend as long as there is a will to defend it (which might weaken over time as war will inevitably make Taiwan less important to the US economically speaking).",
                "If China has high casualty tolerance, I'd say they overwhelm the island.\n\nThe ensuing occupation is a different beast.\n\nAlso, if China doesn't do it QUICKLY, the situation may change.  A prolonged or delayed invasion may result in them being repulsed, and the arrival of new assets from the US or other nearby security partners.  \n\nAny invasion of Taiwan must be rapid, otherwise the risk of failure is high.",
                "They would surrender in 24h.  \nA scenario like Ukraine cannot happen, Taiwan is a small country, they can't afford total destruction. Also USA getting involved would probably mean a long fight and the destruction of the country (and I don't speak about nukes, no-one will use nukes).  \nA long conventional war would just leave the country in ruins.\n\nThe consequences of a short surrender would still be disastrous with political / economic effects. With East and West trade shutting down for a long time. Various sanctions, border control. Permanent alert state in oceans etc ... and everyone wondering what will happen next.  \nThe biggest trade dependent world economies would shrink by 10% to 20% in a few years.",
                "I think the real question is, \"Can China invade Taiwan and keep the valuable fab plants and other infrastructure, and the highly skilled people to run them, intact?\" The answer to that question is probably not. So it's not a straightforward question of taking the territory. It's a question of keeping the value of the territory intact. That doesn't mean that the Chinese won't do it for nationalistic/prestige reasons, damn the consequences.",

                "No they cannot resist,\n\nyes they can make it not worth it.\n\nThere you go no need for RAND.",
                "Unlikely they would be able to resist. However, China would be hit with massive casualties.",
                "Taiwan might not able to resist a Large scale military attack by China but the Taiwan military could drag it down so the blood shed is too great for the Chinese fragile demographics (due to one child policy) essentially erasing bloodlines after bloodlines. A fact that can be exploited, destabilizing the CCP regime (shaking the hierarchy of power dynamics to its uncomfortable levels for the powers within the political elites)"

            "selftext": "It\u2019s been a long 11 years, 35 years old, and a Major in the Marine Corps. After years of working laboriously, I finally reached a rank that will at least take me to the promise land of  pension and healthcare for life. However, I\u2019ve noticed that I\u2019ve come to a point in life where I just don\u2019t t have the same level of motivation anymore like I used to as young Officer. I think I\u2019m just tired of the games, tired of the politics, and I\u2019m just tired of the constant nonsense that the job comes with.\n\nRecently, I asked a GS employee about their performance evaluation system. I asked him how much does it matter? He told me that for pay increase it mattered. Then I asked him what about for promotion? He told me that it did not matter one bit. I stood there thinking existentially of a life where the concept of \u201cpromote or die\u201d just doesn\u2019t exist. A world where highs levels of emotional stress and distress can be avoided hypothetically, unequivocally, and literally leading to a state where you can just do your job really well and know that you will be OK. Only to realize, that is the civilian job world. Oh, how I yearned so much for a job like that in that very moment.\n\nAs a young college graduate, the Marine Corps had provided me exceptional level of talent, skills, leadership, managerial skills, and the ability to quickly make a decision in a dynamic world. These skills are hard to learn in the civilian world and those who do get a chance to lear , do so much much later in their lives once they climbed the corporate ladder. There is no doubt the level of leadership I have received in the military is far greater and superior than anything I would have received as a brand new college graduate in the civilian world. I am very thankful to the Marine Corps. However, I ask myself what more do I have left to learn in this organization? When I look at it, the level of difference between a Major and a Lieutenant Colonel, in terms of growth: it does not seem to outweigh the possibilities of growth and learning I can do in the civilian world.\n\nI am scared, I amm confused, I am nervous about the possibility of leaving the Marine Corps. I just don\u2019t know if it\u2019s worth losing my retirement benefits. However, one thing is for sure, that I have stopped drinking the Kool-Aid long time ago and today I am just going with the motions with complete lack of job satisfaction.\n\nAnyone else ever felt like this? What is your advice?",

                "I walked away after 13 as an E-7.  Spent 7 as active duty and 6 national guard. My whole section retired or moved so I was doing the job for 2 officers and 3 enlisted at a MEPS.  I kept screaming for help and not only did they ignore me like a red headed stepchild, they\u2019d find fault with my work because I either didn\u2019t have enough time to complete it or didn\u2019t even know I was supposed to do it (like updating SOPs every few years which the officers always did).\n\nDespite all that I kept grinding on because I truly loved being a part of it.  Until one day I showed up during the week since I was in the area and got a few extra things done.  I got told by the unit secretary \u201cOh, Col X said he\u2019s noticed you\u2019ve been really trying harder.\u201d  I flipped out.  Told her (not a civilian) I shouldn\u2019t have to come in during the week to get a job done that takes 5 people instead of 1 and no one ever helps despite me asking EVERY weekend in the morning meeting.\n\nThe weekend before I separated I got sent an email by the new Shirt who cc\u2019d in the commander and XO that he hopes I\u2019ll sign up for just a few more years because he\u2019d hate for me to lose out on retirement.  I \u2018replied all\u2019 (oopsie /s) with \u201cI\u2019ve been abused by this unit for years.  Everyone let me drown despite hearing my pleas for help.  Month after month.

Though I didn't know it at the time it was the best career decision too. It's scary, making such a huge decision, not knowing what will happen from losing that certainty that comes with the uniform. Your comments remind me of the state of mind I was in during my last few years in. It was terrible, toxic leadership, career field was circling the drain (intel), constant moving, health issues, and most importantly my family was done with the military. My wife and kids wanted the old me back. The point where I made the choice to leave hit me like a ton of bricks. One day after having to stay late for the millionth time for the latest dumbass reason I finally got home. My wife said to me \"this needs to stop, you're so angry from work when you get home that your hands are shaking, I've been telling the kids to leave you alone for at least 30 minutes to give you time to cool off.\" \n\nThat was it for me. There is nothing on earth worth that kind of bullshit. In the years since that day my relationship with my wife and kids has improved dramatically. I'm home much more often, we've stayed in the same house for 8 years, my youngest has even stayed in the same school district almost to high school. My wife and I go on dates again, we talk a lot more, and she says now she doesn't have to manage my stress anymore. \n\nI get it man, I really do, and for me, it's not worth the retirement. Would I even be married if I had stayed in? Would my relationship with my kids have gotten worse? It's scary to think of what might have been.

Promoted last Summer below the zone on merit based promotion, and for the past year I have just been completely dissatisfied with work, to the point where I actively dread it. The field grade politics, toxic leadership, general incompetence and rampant laziness that goes unaddressed, rules meant to cater to the lowest common denominator, the general infantilization of subordinates getting their hands held through tasks because everything is \"no fail\", the needing to justify to leadership use of simple entitlements like actually using my earned leave (sitting on 115 days in the books as I type this), the lack of professionalism in the workplace, the pointless and repetitive BS garrison tasks, the constant rotational deployments and PCS moves... it's really become death by a thousand cuts.\n\nI love leading and empowering Soldiers, I love pulling together a team, training, and conducting a mission, I love being a mentor to junior leaders, and I love being challenged. Being a staff officer again, with one more shot at \"Command\" (glorified administrative middle manager) in a Battalion before hitting retirement eligibility and maybe getting a Brigade after isn't appealing enough to suffer through another 9 years of essentially monotonous battle rhythm meetings, short suspenses, unnecessary stress, probably another 2-3 rotational deployments, and an equivalent or greater number of PCS moves.\n\nI have my health and am fortunate to have never suffered a major injury in the service. I have my mental health and acuity of wit. I have a pregnant fiancee whom I care for more than anything in this world, and can't wait to start a family with - a family I can be there for, kids I can raise and not miss any milestones for, and put down some roots and get involved into an actual community without being jerked out by orders in 2-3 years. \n\nTo me, it became an easy choice, I drafted my resignation just last week, have already talked with CoC about it, submitting it in a few days, and I can't wait to get my final date back when packet is accepted/approved. It's already been a massive weight off my shoulders, and I'm more excited about the future now than I've been in a long time now.\n\nThat's just my experience, but I definitely suggest taking an inward look at what's going to make you happy, self-fulfilled, and self-actualized.

It\u2019s what I do now and am happy as hell. A lot of cities and counties give veterans preference to be hired. Of course every job has its bullshit, but it\u2019s absolutely nothing like the bullshit I saw and dealt with in the Navy. Being a union member is incredible. Guaranteed raises, almost impossible to be fucked with like they do in the military, benefits, pension, all that. Yes, the union will protect shitbags, but idgaf about shitbags, you don\u2019t have to pay for a shitbag\u2019s mistakes like you do in the military. To be clear, I\u2019m a firefighter in a major metropolitan area in California, so maybe in a way I\u2019m just wearing rose colored glasses. I worked hard in the Navy, made rank, was liked by my chain, but ultimately decided I was worth more. I had a lot of people in my chain telling me what a silly risk I was making by getting out, and I\u2019ll never find a job that would take care of me and my family like the military would. Not true. Good luck man, idk if you can just coast another 10yrs and collect that pension, I heard that shit is much harder to do nowadays.

That said, I can objectively say that I made the right decision for myself and my family.  I do, however, think that you may be overgeneralizing the private sector a bit.   \n\nThere are many companies that have stringent evaluation processes and will make you yearn for the fitrep process e.g. my current employer does yearly evaluations where you end up writing a small novel about what you accomplished, feedback for 5 - 10 other engineers (about 1 page each), feedback for your manager (about 1/2 page).  All managers across the company then meet where they present you to other managers, comparing your performance against that of your peers at the same level/field.  We also have \"light\" performance evaluations every quarter.\n\n> a life where the concept of \u201cpromote or die\u201d just doesn\u2019t exist\n\nThis is not true of all companies e.g. at my current company you still have x years to reach level y or you are terminated. \n\n> A world where highs levels of emotional stress and distress can be avoided hypothetically, unequivocally, and literally leading to a state where you can just do your job really well and know that you will be OK.\n\nAgain, this is not true of all companies e.g.  you can perform well on the tasks you accomplished but because others around you performed better you will get left behind and ultimately let go.  Microsoft was notorious for this when Steve Ballmer was at the helm.  While my current employer does not stack rank they still expect a given distribution of employee ratings.\n\nAll of this is to say, figure out what works for you and what you want.  Walking away from the pension might even be financially advantageous if you get into the right role with the right company.",
                "I left Active Duty at about 8 years in the Navy as an LT. I have a friend who was 11 years, O4 who got out just a bit before me. We both have gone off to pursue our own personal interests, but we both also went into the reserves. He went to law school and I\u2019m working in programming as a GS. I really like what I\u2019ve been doing since I got off AD. And with both the reserves and GS, I can keep those years I spent towards both retirements. \n\nNavy reserves can be a slog. Imagine stuffing a months worth of admin into one weekend (plus some extra time here and there). I\u2019d guess it\u2019s the same for an officer in any service. But for now I can hold onto the years I\u2019ve already done.\n\nI don\u2019t miss the monotony of one meeting after another. Sometimes meetings in order to plan for other meetings. The politics of who can put what duties on their evaluations to get their hard breakout. The random taskers and bs that pop up and pull you away from your actual job. The moving and constantly having to worry about where I\u2019ll be in 2 years. \n\nI left because I had no control over my life and I don\u2019t regret it at all. Just, have a plan about it.

                "There are pros and cons to being a GS.  The evaluation system is basically \"Are you satisfactory?\" if you are, then nothing else matters.  If you want a bonus/time off award, you can strive to be outstanding and get 5s across the board, but no one can expect that, they expect you to meet the standard.  You can get a quality step increase by being an outstanding performer (early promotion) but those are really most valuable when you get to the higher steps.  You can also sell back your active duty time and have that count towards your federal retirement.  It's also a bit easier to transfer as a federal employee because when you stack up veterans pref, disabled, competitive perm status employee etc... you beat out a lot of the competition.  You also don't just have to be a DoD federal employee, you can work for just about any government or related agency; VA, DOE, DOS, DOJ, Dept of Agriculture, Park services, Education services, Commissary services, GSA, etc... etc...

I am still working towards a military retirement, still get to work with Soldiers/ younger officers, still get to go on meaningful missions, etc. I did deploy as a reservist (in addition to deployments while active). I have an extremely fulfilling civilian job and got to use some of my GI Bill while I was young enough to do a career switch.  I suggest taking a hard look at your goals, how you want your future to look and then make your decision. Also, if it helps, my partner did the same thing. He was a senior enlisted combat arms guy and left for better work life balance. In the reserves he switched over to being a warrant officer. We met in the reserves (I\u2019m a widow) and we share a wonderful life that is supplemented by the Army, but with the freedom of only being part time.

                "Here is my take (20 year retired Navy), You don't mention if you have a family or single which will heavily impact your decision.  From my experience it can take a long time to get into a GS position, but there are factors that make it easier.  Are you willing to relocate, are you located near a major base, mandatory cool off period (military to GS), GS hiring process is slow like months, currently lots of GS hiring is frozen.  Contractor work is always around and you will make more money as a contractor then the GS position (currently I make more then a GS13 Step 7 with locality pay).  Lastly health insurance is huge, not to scare you but we are talking $50 a month (Tricare) versus $800+ a month for insurance through BeneFeds, or company insurance.  Had a family member who worked for Blue Cross/Shield look at both insurances back when I retired and they told me Tricare was the way to go for the coverage versus cost.  Retired Tricare is not like active duty, I have two major MTF's in the area I live and have never had an issue getting care at any of them.  In the end you know yourself, and your families needs best.  Do some research on cost of living as a civilian, research where you want to live, is there a big government employer there?  DO  you want to live in the DC area?  If yes then there are going to be so many jobs (GS and contractor) you will have no problem.  I live in a town with 3 major military bases (2 AF and 1 Army) and hunt USAJOBS weekly looking for opportunities and I see a lot of entry level positions (GS-9, 10) and very little Mid level (GS-12, 13) positions.  Lastly GS positions are all not rainbows, kittens, and unicorns, remember you are working for the government so if it is the DoD same leadership you left in uniform, if it is non DoD there are career people who are comfortable doing just enough and have been doing it that way for years.  Good luck in whatever you decide to do, I wish you the best.",
                "Medically retired adter 16 years and dont regret a moment of it, but that is me. I found happoness in the simplicity of just doing me. More time for my wife and kids.

Either a new duty station, broading assignment or walking away. Nobody can answer that for you. Find happiness and purpose.",
                "i'm a GS/GG employee now, after retiring from the Corps.  wanted to clarify one point:\n\n>Then I asked him what about for promotion? He told me that it did not matter one bit. \n\nthis is false.\n\nfirst of all, for promotion in the GS world, you do not get promoted in your current position (unless you are on a ladder, and those usually top out around GS-12, sometimes 13).  the only way to get promoted, in most cases, is to apply for a new position at a higher grade. and if you are a current gov't employee, applying for a higher grade, they absolutely look at your evaluations\n\nETA: i will also say that not having to worry about high insurance premiums, with the military retirement is a very powerful incentive, along with the retirement check every month, guaranteed income.",

If you have a plan for your next chapter, pull the trigger. I only encourage people to stay put and \u2018tread water\u2019 if they don\u2019t have something better to do.\n\nRegardless, start your VA paperwork *now*. I left $200k on the table in the 4-years between when I left the service and filed my claim. Even if you *think* nothing is wrong with you, file. You have 1-year after separation to finish the claim and get backpay to the date of separation. Head over to r/veteransbenefits to see more!",

You could end up being twice passed over and separated before your 18th year in service if you stay in.\n\nI was an Army Aviation Warrant Officer. I was placed in an O-3 slot in my 2nd duty assignment (which I was successful at) and became qualified in 2 of the 3 career tracks without attending the Q courses. In my 3rd duty assignment I was again put in an O-3 slot for 18 months leading into my 9th year in service. By then, I was burnt out. I wanted out and sent resumes to aviation operations, including US Customs. Interviewing with them and talking with the pilots at one of their bases, I was advised that it was as bureaucratic and political as the Army. And that I would not be able to draw Civil Service retirement pay until I turned 55. That was not for me, so I stayed in. I got 11 months of Degree Completion after which I volunteered for Aviation SpecOps. I was recharged by the challenge. They sent me to DLI for 6 months as part of the 1 year train up to be an operational pilot. I finished the last 8 years of my career there. I retired with 20 TIS, plenty of disabilities and totally burned out. Thankfully, my pension and disability pay afforded me the ability to work or not, so have been happy since.\n\nIt is a hard decision. With today's tight labor market you could probably land a management position making a lot more money. Or you could stay in and strive to make O-5 and command or take on new challenges. Just know, you will be moving forward and will do alright whichever you course choose.\n\nGood luck !",

I thought I would miss it, but I often forget I was even in. Obviously your mileage may vary and in general, I\u2019d recommend anyone to finish up their pension.

I\u2019m glad I stayed, my last couple tours really set me up for what I do now and I am paid well for a job with great people that I find enjoyable and rewarding. YMMV ofc\n\nThat said, before making the choice. Network, build your network and use it. Don\u2019t just add people on LinkedIn. Reach out and interview them. Find folks who made the same choice, find ones that stayed. Find out what you want to do when you get out. \n\nI help a lot of vets with job hunting and networking through a couple volunteer orgs. It\u2019s the thing we all suck at and it helps more than anything else with a smoother transition to post-military employment. All the workshops, resume services, etc all bs. \n\nThere are some good orgs out there. American Corporate Partners (ACP) helps with mentors, but you have to know you\u2019re getting out.

For me the guard was eating too much into my civilian career (our state & unit had a high Optempo, so your unit and mileage may vary), and the juice was quickly not becoming worth the squeeze. \n\nBut this is an alternative way to continue working towards that pension and healthcare, while getting to start and grow your civilian career.",

The other crazy thing is how much my pay is going to be going up.\n\n\nIf you write a good resume and get it on the job boards the recruiters will come to you. Particularly if you have unique technical skills or experience. You have to do the work to grind out applications, but it its an employee's job market out there. There aren't enough workers for all the jobs, especially in my area.\n\n\nThe pay... hoo boy. First you can negotiate your salary, which is huge. Secondly, you can file your disability, which if you've been in the military for 10 years, SOMETHING is wrong with you. Once I started going to civilian doctors I realized a lot complaints people in the military have are medical issues. If you hit 30% disabled you get preferential hiring for govt jobs, and corporations are required to have 7% of their employees be disabled, which also helps you in the door. Helps with hiring and you get some money and medical care the rest of your life.\n\n\nQuality of life is another big factor for me. Looking at jobs that required me to work Navy hours or work schedules just print money. The rest of the jobs let you go home and you dont stand duty. I want to be there for my kids, not deployed to who knows where their entire lives.\n\n\nThe final factor for me was how recruiting is going and the world situation. With everything going on in Europe I was anticipating more deployments to East Europe (happened), the Middle East because of Iran (just happened), and China getting froggy over Taiwan (hasn't happened yet), and now there is the bonus africa stuff going on. More work and stress with less people. Id rather have a normal job where I can be there for my kids and not losing my hair over government induced stress or losing my career because some goober in my unit fucked up over the weekend and I was in charge at the time.\n\n\nIf you want you can still transition into the reserves, you can pay for tricare, which is pretty good, you still do military stuff sometimes, and always have the option to go active again, and you still get the pension just later in life.\n\n\nI can't stress enough how much happier I am since leaving. Its been like a HUGE weight was lifted off my shoulders. The lifers who say its hard out here are crazy.",

However, this only grew Sarah's audience.\u201d  \n>  \n>In turn, Ashton-Cirillo expressed her gratitude for Maliar\u2019s statement.  \n>  \n>\u201cI have never been so honored as to read the dual statements released by Ukraine\u2019s Ministry of Defense and Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Maliar regarding my work on behalf of victory,\u201d she said in a Twitter post.  \n>  \n>\u201cFor 17 months my life has been dedicated to Ukraine\u2019s liberation, with much of my work shrouded behind a very visible fa\u00e7ade. Now as the frontlines of the information war becomes more and more vital, I am honored to carry out the myriad responsibilities and duties that the Territorial Defense Forces, Armed Forces of Ukraine and Ukrainian Ministry of Defense have assigned to me.\u201d  \n>  \n>She concluded by saying how much she looks forward to Ukraine liberating all of its sovereign territory from Russian occupation.  \n>  \n>( Sources : [https://english.nv.ua/nation/new-ukrainian-military-spokesperson-enrages-russian-propagandists-50343778.html](https://english.nv.ua/nation/new-ukrainian-military-spokesperson-enrages-russian-propagandists-50343778.html) ,  [https://twitter.com/NewVoiceUkraine](https://twitter.com/NewVoiceUkraine) , [https://www.facebook.com/TheNewVoiceUkraine](https://www.facebook.com/TheNewVoiceUkraine) )",

                "Padres are fucking awesome, and they don't bring up religion unless you do. They're often in the field, on the ground with troops. They're accessible for partners and families. They're supportive and outside the regular chain of command, so you can bitch to them without it biting you in the ass. They also lack the stigma of psychs and counsellors, and you don't have to see them in a formalised way. Coffee, or out for pt, whatever, they are happy to meet you.\n(Obvious \"there are dicks in every job, but for the most part...\")\n\nWant a prayer that appeals to the universe instead of God? Cool, they'll do that. Want a prayer of self meditation rather than appealing to any higher power? Cool, they'll do that. Heck, I know Catholic padres that have sat Shiva with Jewish members who have lost family far away, or helped a member pray to a god that padre doesn't believe in. \n\nRegardless of that padre or chaplains faith, it's not about their faith. It's about the person they are talking to at that point in time. Christian faith, Aboriginal faith, Muslim faith, and Sheikh faith all have Padre's or Chaplains within defence, and more. And not a single one of them will give two shits what the faith of the person talking to them is, unless it matters to that person. \n\nThe balance should represent the needs and religions of the serving members, but they're not going to fire existing padres because the demographic shifted either. It takes time.",
                "X-navy guy here. It's hard to explain the role of the chaplain to those who don't serve, but they're like an unjudgmental friend who is still within the rank structure but kinda not as well. When you feel shithouse from seeing some of the the worst things humanity can deliver you can always go and have a cry with the chaplain. He mightn't be able to explain why this shit happens, but he will always try to help you through it.\n\n\n\n\nThat's a shitty explaination I guess, but I reckon most pussers, pongos and RAAFies would agree with me.",

Enlisting vs commissioning is a vastly different experience. You don't need to imagine some of the abuses of power that come with the differences in power, there's plenty of news articles. Chaplains are one group of people that have enough power to walk into a CO's office if something is off, and in 13 years within Army I had mostly good ones who would keep an eye/ear out for what's happening and making sure the soldiers are ok.",
                "The chaplains in the ADF are fantastic for the seemingly endless humanitarian operations that the ADF are attending.\n\nThey engage with their religious counterparts in different nations and allows for a far more efficient distribution of resources. \n\nIt's not all just to run religious services or ceremonies.",
                "I hope people actually read the article. The high evangelical chaplain to evangelical members count does seem high but the title only shows that and not the representation of any other denomination. Even overall it is 312 chaplains for 30,743 members is a reasonable ratio.\n\nAnd that ignores that chaplains support non-religious people.  I remember my platoon's padre supporting me (religious) and my partner (atheist) through relationship + military complications, the padre being immensely supportive to her.\n\nDenominations don't even need to only support their own denominations in that either. They'll support anyone of the same faith, other faith or even no faith. It's not locked to just within their own denomination.  \n\n\nThe article is misleading, the article title is misleading and OP posting the same article title is misleading.",
                "The interesting thing about comments for more psychs and counsellors is I wonder how many of them are happy to stay in the field day after day in combat? I see how Padres with their faith will sacrifice a lot to help soldiers. Heard a great podcast about a Padre in Ukraine and how he is always on the front line.",
                "I think people will find - on balance serving members had a positive attitude towards chaplains. \n\nTheir main service to most people is to provide an ear and advise on personal matters. It's mostly not religious.\n\nI'll be honest, you get very much indoctrinated in the military to get the job done. Sometimes, command needs to get told their decision is wrong.",
                "This article is quite misleading. Chaplains don\u2019t provide support just to those members of the same denomination. So the headline is already catchy but misleading. Secondly, why are the denominations pulled apart? I.e., why is there \u201cAnglican\u201d AND \u201cchurch of England\u201d; \u201ccatholic\u201d AND \u201cRoman catholic\u201d? Thirdly, any chaplain that lets their faith get in the way of supporting a member or referring a member respectfully elsewhere on issues of same-sex, abortion, divorce etc., has failed to adhere with Defence Values and that can and should be addressed appropriately. (Not to mention there are LGBT chaplains). \n\nIn my experience, Chaplains are called on to provide support and counsel regardless of faith or lack thereof. I would suggest the only times members would specifically seek out a chaplain of their denomination would be for the rare instances where the chaplain is requested to provide a religious service - ie births deaths marriages.",
                "My brother in law was considering a chaplaincy position like this and told me the main reason why they're a valuable part of the supports is that they don't report what is discussed to the person's CO unless it is thought they may harm themselves or others. Take that away without an equivalent replacement in place and it'll be catastrophic.\n\nI'm sure there is a way to provide that without religious chaplains, but removing the position and adding more counsellors/psychologists as is being suggested is not the way forward because there will be no informal role for them to talk to without their CO being informed. Just adding confidentiality to counsellors isn't the solution anyway because you don't have deniability such as \"Oh, I was talking with the chaplain about footsball and god\".",

                "Sometimes, the Padre/Chaplain is the best choice for a difficult situation. The Padre is the one who goes with the CO or his reprenstitive to deliver the news to the NOK that someone has died. He/She stays as long as that person/family want them to. But there are other situations where the Padre is the solution that isn't the proverbial sledgehammer. \n\nOne example from my time had to do with a young digger who'd fallen in with the wrong crowd, subsequently fucked up and was in the process of being booted from the army. This lad was definitely having a hard time dealing with it. He'd told a few people that joining the army was the first thing he'd done right, and this would break his parents' hearts because they'd been so proud of him for turning his life around.  \n\nSo when one of my mates who had access to the medical supplies called me late at night to ask me what to do because this lad had asked him if he could slip him a few vials morphine, we had to go through our list of options. We decided that, given this kid's potential state of mind, getting the padre first was the only option that didn't come with the risk of door-kicking and aggression. So I rang the padre while my mate called the kid and kept him talking until they got there. Never did find out if he was planning to off himself, but I did have a few members of the hierarchy come up and tell me that we'd made the right call.\n\nOf course, I have to mention you need to know your padre. There are good ones and shit ones. If it had been the padre from a few years prior, we'd have probably just called the unit duty officer.",
                "One of the most powerful photographs I have seen is two Chaplains, one Jewish, one Catholic, tending to wounded and dying soldiers. The Rabbi had used his Kippah to wipe the blood from a dying man's face, so the Priest cut a piece of fabric from his uniform pants as a replacement.\nIn a lousy, dangerous situation they were there to care for people, and helped them and each other across any religious divide.

                "The article appears to be making two claims. \n\n1. There is a push by evangelical ministers to infiltrate the ADF and this is evidenced by a disproportionate number of evangelical ministers in the ADF. \n\nI have no idea if this is true. If it is true, it has very little chance of turning ADF members into Hillsong members - that isn\u2019t how the ADF members roll. \n\n2. The incorporation of religious ministers of any denomination is incompatible with Australia\u2019s secular traditions and irrelevant given the lack of religiosity of ADF members. \n\nThis betrays a gross misunderstanding of how \u201cpadres\u201d in the ADF work. They are not there to proselytise or \u201cpreach\u201d - although they can do that  if approached. They are instead people outside the chain of command who can provide a sympathetic ear, a kind word or a shoulder to lean on. They are ecumenical by nature and certainly don\u2019t tell non-believers they will go to hell etc.\n\nThey are religious mainly because their role was defined when Australia was a much more religious society and this sort of moral support was largely delivered through religion. \n\nThere could be a role for a secular \u201cpadre\u201d system given the changed nature of our society but putting in \u201ccounsellors\u201d or \u201ctherapists\u201d will be unlikely to be seen as outside the chain of command and/or health system.",

Sinking a Chinese, Indian or Iranian ship might lead to those countries sending more military aid to Russia, or actively declaring war on Ukraine. Sinking a Turkish ship could theoretically trigger Article 5 of NATO (it won't, but in theory it could). Sinking any neutral-flagged vessel would turn that country against Ukraine, potentially reducing the amount of humanitarian aid they receive from abroad. It would put America in a very tight spot in particular- a pillar of their foreign policy, especially in regards to China, is freedom of navigation (which is why they send warships through the Taiwan Strait frequently). How could the US support a country that is actively sinking ships and hindering freedom of navigation in international waters while actively opposing Russia and China's attempts to do the same thing?",

Then a second career in the IT industry and earned a second pension. Two years after my second retirement, I was old enough for Social Security.  BTW, SS is based on your last 35 years of income, not everything.  So based on when I changed from enlisted to officer, all those poor days of making low salary disappeared. So military retirement, second pension from my IT career and Social Security added up to a nice income; almost what I was making when I was working.  I got chastised a lot because I wasn\u2019t the go- getter; didn\u2019t work hard to get stripes; didn\u2019t go all out to become Major/LtCol/Col or compete to get become IT lead tech so I can be a manager of others.

When a job isn't working out, I don't have to sneak around; I tell them that I'm looking for something else.  Others apply for new jobs in secret out of fear of being fired.

If you don't take VA, that's $21K take home a year, pretty sure saying hello to folks at Walmart would cover the rest of your expenses. Again, pick your second career. Work sucks, we would all take $5K/mo to sit on our asses and drink beer, but we have to clock in somewhere. Max out your TSP, invest, invest, invest while you're in and maybe live off that when you retire. You can draw from your 401k if you promise to take a specified amount for X amount of months without a penalty prior to 65.5 yrs old. There's 1,000 ways to live, but having a steady 1,800 check would at least put food on the table and good luck finding insurance for a whole family for less than $300/mo anywhere else. \nPut. Up.

                "So let me lead off by saying that everyone is different man and for each person, they really have to make these decisions with the information they have of themselves that no one else will have. Do you love it or hate it? How much? How does it effect you? Can you hang on? What's the cost to you specifically.\n\nWith that in mind I can tell you what my position for me is. I have been in 15 years. I used to love it. I drank the kool-aid and absolutely had pride in everything I did with the Army. That probably couldn't be further from the truth now. I literally spend almost every day thinking about what my life could have been if I hadn't enlisted. I think about the opportunities I had to give up on because \"yep gotta deploy again\". I have really bad mental problems that I should get looked at but the last time I trusted a first line and told them I was having issues, they ran it up to the CSM and that started a process to push me out of my Platoon Sergeant position to go be a desk jocky away from the Battalion. That was the last thing I had pride in left, being a guy who would get to lead Soldiers. Help them, their families, protect them from poor leadership and give them someone to lean on when they needed advice or care. Now I do nothing worthwhile and have no sense of happiness in my work. Someone asked me for my job description today because I was voluntold to be on a detail where I have to give a profile of myself. I told them orderly room NCO and they wanted a description of what I do on a day to day basis and I literally couldn't tell them because the only thing I do is move desks, tables, and supplies between upstairs and downstairs. That and I am basically the warm body used for every detail under the sun. \n\nI think a lot of the responses you get here are probably going to be pretty filtered because I would think that most people that would hang around an Army forum post-retirement are people that really loved it and like being around a community. Or at the very least they have some sort of nostalgia to it all. \n\nYou're not gonna get a lot of responses from the guys that off themselves after retirement (one of the guys I knew actually did that this year unfortunately). \n\nThen you got assholes like me who are disgruntled and debate whether they should say anything because they worry they're gonna get excoriated for saying something against the general flow of the replies. I'm personally trying to look for a way out right now but I'm told I still have obligations on my indef contract (trying to debate that currently). \n\nSo is it worth it? I'm sure for most people, absolutely. But the people who made it to twenty and aren't happy with the cost probably aren't on the Army subreddit. Whether it's because they don't wanna be or they can't be. Just my opinion on it man. \n\nGood luck dude or dudette. Whatever you decide, I genuinely hope it goes well for you.",

Of course, for some people it is worth it, and some people have a much better experience than I have. \n\nI think after 20 years of being in the military and finally getting out; all those retired service members will tell you it's worth it. But all those retired service members are finished and there's no telling what they *actually* had to do in that 20 year period. \n\nFor me, it isn't worth it.

Now compounded with a career of 30 years, obviously maxing out at an E-9, translates into roughly $5K - 6K per month for the rest of the retiree's life.  This monthly amount is also subject to periodic CPI-based cost of living increases.\n\nIn my example, I retired in 2012 as an E-9 at 30 years.  My initial pension was $51K (annual); now, twelve years into retirement, my annual pension is $71K.

For us it was worth it. \n\nKeep in mind all sorts of hardships happened during our service and that is likely for those that willing to go for the twenty. But it in the end, it\u2019s worth it. \n\nHealthcare and education add to the attraction of staying twenty years or more.

Probably the orc factories can't keep up with the rate of destroyed orc artillery. \n\nNow AFU uses cluster bombs so more orc artillery soldiers get liquidated along with their artillery.  The orcs will replace these liquidated artillery soldiers with new soldiers that will be less accurate with their replacement artillery.\n\nThen the West is increasing its production of artillery shells for Ukraine.  Then the US will provide GLSDB's this fall so AFU will have more range to destroy more orc artillery.  \n\nIt feels like in the fall AFU will see the tipping point where it will have the advantage over the orcs in artillery.  Since this war is primarily about artillery battles, then this tipping point moment will be very important for AFU.",

Seems like a lot of people complain about their time in the military. It also seems like almost every veteran relished and looks back fondly on their time in the military.\n\n\nThe way I view it is this: yea I know it\u2019s porbably going to suck and it\u2019s going to be a grind.. but I want to better myself as a person. As a human, as an American, as a son, as a brother. I want to become a healthier individual.\n\n\nI\u2019m currently working a maintenance gig making $20.40 an hour in a HCOL area so I\u2019m still at home with my parents. I\u2019ve been pretty depressed and anxious about my future. I dropped out of college twice. I graduated welding school in March but no union has taken me in. I have decent hands on skills and I can make almost any minor repair that you need but honestly I want to get out of blue collar work by the time I\u2019m 30 and I feel as though entering the military for some type of IT job could help me. I\u2019d try my best to achieve my associates in the military if I do join and hopefully just hit the refresh button on my life.\n\n\nAlso a few other things; my medical record.. ive been diagnosed with ADHD as a kid, and more recently anxiety/depression. I do a good enough job keeping these illnesses at bay but I\u2019m afraid that the diagnosis will ruin my chances for me.\n\n\nJust not sure. I\u2019m so lost in life. All I really want is a white picket fence.. I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s so fucking difficult lol. I think the military could help me",

                "Here\u2019s my spin on it. I\u2019m going to take out the percentage of my friends maimed/injured/ really fucked up out of this because for the most part that is a ridiculously small fraction of the military overall. Myself and many of my friends are doing pretty well for ourselves. Some of my buddies are doing REALLY well and some, some are doing down right shitty. But I can say the same for my non veteran friends as well. I worked really fucking hard in the Marines and I carried that with me in college and the jobs I\u2019ve had since then. Again this is my POV. Being a Marine instilled a sense of respect, professionalism and confidence. Being a grunt taught me perseverance, setting an objective and having the tenacity to do what is necessary to achieve that objective. Being a recruiter taught me how to engage with people, use my charisma and how to present my military service in a very business like and corporate manner. Being a civilian after 12 years in the Marines humbled the fuck out of me. Afghanistan and Iraq were easier than my first year as a civilian.  Everyone on Reddit says to join the Air Force and maybe that would be the best fit I recommend talking to all of the branches and seeing which one fits best. As a single Marine my QOL at Wallace Creek was better than any of the Air Forces i saw in Texas or Oklahoma. Did being a Marine suck often? Fuck yea but there were so many times it was unbelievably awesome. I truly believe the intangibles have carried me quite far and will continue to do so.",

I'm an officer in Naval Aviation, which means fun flying on the carrier, interesting missions, great foriegn ports with friends, and guaranteed rest every day so we're okay to fly. \nThat being said, other officer jobs are much more draining, and the entire enlisted cadre typically has it worse for worse pay. \nBut regardless of what you do, you'll likely never be closer to anyone in this life than the people you serve with.

But if you're young, in good health and looking for something to do then I would recommend it, just use all the tools available to you while in to be the best you can be when you get out.

When/if you make it to the upper echelons, be the leader you wanted. Too often people become a leader and decide to do the same shit that was done to them because \"ThAt'S hOw It WaS wHeN i WaS cOmInG uP\". Fuck that noise, it only perpetuates shit leadership and makes it harder to argue staying in is the correct thing to do.\n\nWith that said, it WILL set you up with a lot of experience and the things you can control, make the best decisions for you and make the best of the situations. You can't control the bad, so don't be the negative POS soldier that's constantly crying about shit. Conversely, don't be the obnoxious person that goes around saying \"It is what it is\" all the fucking time.\n\nDo you, get what you want out of it (travel, experience, career) and just be a good person.\n\n**ALSO do not let recruiters talk you into a job you don't want. EVERY JOB is available eventually. It just might not be available when you ask at that time. Stick to YOUR goal and don't let them bully you. Their rank means shit to you. They are in NO position to punish you. You're not in the military yet and don't let them convince you otherwise.**\n\n**SECOND ALSO** Maintenance in the military is largely garbage hours and work conditions. Unless that's something you REALLY wanna do for the rest of your life, I'd look for a job that will help you transition to a better job in the civilian world. 35T is the IT job in the Army.

The army pays, down to the cent, as little as they can get away with. That means when you are single they pay you exactly enough for a car payment, phone bill. When you are married, they add the local median rent price to your pay. The kicker, is that you have to be COMPLETELY MOVED OUT OF THE BARRACKS, or as civilians say, homeless, before you can even APPLY for this extra money to be added to your check. For eight months, while I repeatedly badgered my command to please let me have an apartment and tried to track down a finance specialist who would actually take the time to submit my paperwork rather than shred it, I spent the honeymoon phase of my marriage living in my squadmate's closet with my young wife. As far as the army knew, I was homeless.\n\nI never once saw a guy actually get his enlistment bonus. They get lost in paperwork for years to maybe reappear a couple months after you sign your REenlistment.\n\nFort cavazos (Fort Hood when I was there) currently has 2 working dining facilities that are smaller than your school cafeteria, on a base of ~80k soldiers and most aren't even getting fed.\n\nSoldiers aren't allowed to sue the military, especially their medical facilities. Military doctors cannot be sued just for being shitty, so they hire cheaper, shittier medical personnel and/or give you the cheapest, shittiest medical training because they can, and its cheaper that way.

(additional certs, etc); don't waste your time doing dumb shit, make your time in service work for you.\n\nI did the one enlistment and TBH it sucked. I wanted to get out, but loved what I did (Armor) I bit the bullet and reenlisted. It got better as I rose in rank and I became quite good at what I did.

                "So, I might have some unique insight here for you. I joined the Army at 19, because I felt lost and aimless and the idea of something SUPER organized that forced you to better yourself was so appealing to me at the time. It sounds like you have similar motivations.\n\nI was in college so I joined the Guard and ROTC at the same time and did Simultaneous Membership Program (SMP). A lot of people asked why I didn't just do ROTC first to see if I liked it, and the truth is I wanted to be locked in. I knew if I had an out, I would take it the moment I felt overwhelmed.\n\nLong story short, I got a minor injury doing some ROTC training about 6 months in. Eventually had an MRI because of the injury, and they found an unrelated issue in my spine. Relatively minor, a slightly bulging disc, but I hadn't yet completed basic and AIT because I was finishing out the semester at school, so I could still be medically disqualified. Which the Guard did, pretty much immediately. ROTC offered to fight the disqualification and get me an exemption, but being disqualified really spiraled my mental health so I got angry and resentful, and told them not to bother.\n\nLooking back, it was probably for the best. There are so many reasons to join the military, many of them complicated. But, as I grew up and went through my own self discoveries, I realized the true reason I joined, at the end of the day, was to fill a hole in myself, plain and simple. I wanted the military to give me something I felt I was missing. I think that was a bad reason to do it. The military can teach you a lot, and it can help you better yourself in a lot of ways, but I think mental health is a bit of a weak point.  The military will help you pave over that hole you feel in yourself, but it will NOT help you fill it.\n\nEveryone's different, and everyone's situation is different, so only you can decide what's best for you. But if you're looking to the military because you think it'll help with those mental health problems you've been experiencing, it won't.",

The healthcare and benefits are great, but being babied can be nothing short of infuriating. \nWhat should you do it you\u2019re that curious? Do four years, and if you hate it, you tried. Time flies and you\u2019ll have memorable experiences, for better or worse.",

Keeping one or starting one. It\u2019s rough on your mental health, even in support. You often won\u2019t feel appreciated for what you do, if you\u2019re a hard worker you more likely to face burnout because the unit would rather have you do the job and know it\u2019ll be done correctly than spend more time getting others to your level of competency.(In saying that, find those around you who want to learn and keep to them.) always be planning for a life outside of the military even if you choose to make it a career. Things happen, you might change your mind, get injured, etc. be ready to transition out at any moment. \n\nIn my experience, I believe the pros outweigh the cons. Last bit, if there\u2019s something within your command\u2019s ability to provide for you, don\u2019t take no for an answer. If you\u2019re hungry for advancement and the things that will better you in your career go after them continuously and try to find yourself a good mentor, network with people you respect across multiple units. A lot of times having contacts outside your unit can be the reason a mission is successful.",

However -- you will do a lot of great things, meet a lot of great people (and some not-so-great).    \n\n\nI would also suggest doing your research before going in.   Some jobs and locations are a lot worse than others.  For example, you are likely to have a more miserable time if you have a miserable occupation.   You can join the military and be an IT professional or maybe doing something interesting with aircraft.... or.. you could join the military and be a sanitization specialist.     You could end up stationed someplace amazing... or you could end up somewhere terrible.  \n\n\nI couldn't honestly say which jobs are best or worst ...

                "In my opinion the largest differentiator for job satisfaction is doing something that you wanted to do and got to do it or not. I went combat arms, went into a more specialized unit, and then special operations. Combat arms had lots of practice, cleaning, toy solider stuff, and lots of very direct guidance. I had to volunteer and go through selection processes. One I\u2019d gone through the pipeline, it was a very different world. Working alongside professionals who wanted to be there and be the best. Small 12 man teams. Lots of training and there were so many skills to train on. Everyday a new challenge a chance to learn. A mission larger than myself. Hundreds of people supporting our team to accomplish the mission and come home. We were tied ultimately for the better part of the last 20 years with GWOT, so there wasn\u2019t much downtime at all. We were also expected to take broad guidance or objectives from higher and each member of the team had a part in working out the exact details of the operation. Lots of time being cold, wet, tired, and on edge, but it made the time go quick and I left with lots of brothers and lifelong friends. Did I zig when I should have zigged from time to time? Sure, but no regrets and I carry forward the experiences and skills in lots of what I do day to day. Good luck! Choose the right path!",

                "The military is what you make of it. Your unit's leadership/op-tempo can make it better or worse, but it really depends on you. A lot of the people here complaining based their entire viewpoint on a few people/incidents (by no means all, but a lot of people who hated their time in the military didn't do anything themselves to make it better). If you invest the time in yourself, you could leave the military with at least an associates degree, in the best shape of your life and some of the best friends you'll ever have. If you drink away every weekend, you'll leave angry and bitter with some of the best friends you'll ever have. There are absolutely legitimate grievances to have, but from what I've seen, most people hate the military because they're expected to work, but that's just my perspective. Another thing to keep in mind on reddit, I've seen someone else say somewhere else, that reddit is kind of the smoke pit of sorts, where we all congregate to air out our grievances and is by no means a perfectly accurate representation of what it's actually like.\n\nThe military will offer the resources that could help you, but taking advantage of that is entirely on you.",
                "Here's my two cents. It depends on the Service that you enter and the career field that you go into, and also the mindset that you maintain while in. If you're keen on going into IT then you need to be able to get the ASVAB scores to match. The higher the ASVAB score, the wider the selection of career choices.\n\nAir Force and Navy get treated better but Army and Marines have better comradery (probably built upon a foundation of mutual suffering)\n\n Also, speaking from experience, if you have issues with depression and those issues aren't prohibitive to joining the military, then don't go Intel. Intel sounds cool but can exacerbate any underlying depression because of the things that you may see or hear.\n\nFinally, the military is a government organization and therefore you run into a lot of bureaucracy which frustrates people. Especially when dealing with the \"good idea fairy\" that plagues the lower echelons of the officer ranks."

Its helicopter fleet is decimated, at half its original capacity. Its airforce are getting pummelled, its infantry have had to send the senior men who used to train troops at home, into combat, meaning that troops aren't being trained even nearly as well as they used to be, which wasn't great in the first place.

The guard have it right and so did firstborn tactical squads, but as much as I love the primaris, it makes no sense to have squads entirely comprised of plasma weapons, flamers, or rocket launchers. Typical heavy weapons (like tactical squads) are assigned to a couple guys who become weapon specialists. A hellblaster squad is an entire team full of specialists, and is overkill. Like, say you have 100 miles of terrain to fight over... And there are two armoured companies attacking at either end, and you only have a single squad of hellblasters... They can't cover that ground quickly enough. They can blow one unit to smithereens, but strategically you've just put all your eggs in one basket and lost one of your flanks. The primaris are supposed to be flexible and modular, but their squads are too rigid and unvaried. It makes more sense to have multiple tactical squads across the line with around 2 plasma specialists to counter any enemy armour. \n\nI'll never be able to hold my contempt at how stupid infernus squads are with such short range. It should have been a kit allowing intercessor squads to have a flamer in the squad. \n\nMoreover, the space marine hierarchy is *too* simple. Scout, brother, sergeant, lieutenant, captain, master. Easy right? No corporal or 2IC of a squad. I've had this question answered with \"well the second-most experienced takes over the second squad\" which I say is far too arbitrary. Lieutenant is a step in the right direction, but I've started putting \"2nd sergeants\" in my squads if I ever want to split them.

For example a tank regiment focuses purely on the name sake but the rest of the army would more typically conform to 2-5 battalions organized in brigades. With 2-4 brigades composing a division and a few divisions as an army.  How many regiments compose a larger grouping and what's that grouping called?

                "> The order, which the administration is calling \u201cthe most significant transformation of the military justice system since the UCMJ was established in 1950,\u201d officially implements changes passed by Congress as part of fiscal year 2022\u2019s National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), and comes two years after an independent review commission on sexual assault in the military, formed by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, recommended moving prosecution of sexual assault in the military outside the chain of command.\n\nSo what did the act of Congress do if there was still need for an executive order? \n\n> Key among the changes in the order is the establishment of rules to govern the newly formed Offices of Special Trial Counsel (OSTC) which, composed of a panel of independent military prosecutors, would make prosecutorial decisions involving sexual assault and other violent crimes.\n\nHow are they military prosecutors and independent? Does the OSTC answer directly to the President/Sec Def? \n\n> On a call with reporters previewing the executive order, a senior administration official called the move \u201ca turning point for survivors of gender-based violence in the military.\u201d\n\nWhy put this in here other than for fluff? Its a meaningless statement for the reader. Who is the official? If they were on a phone call with reporters, I'm guessing they weren't anonymous. \n\n> It \u201ctook time\u201d for the Department of Defense to put the services in place, the White House said Friday, calling it a \u201cmonumental change\u201d to the current system of military justice.\n\nThe White House is a building. Who was speaking for the White House?\n\n> \u201cYou had to basically create a separate system just to handle these crimes,\u201d National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications John Kirby told CNN\u2019s Kayla Tausche during a call with reporters. \u201cAnd that meant standing up offices, that meant manning those offices, that meant getting trained investigators and prosecutors in those offices, and setting up the structure and that just took a took a little bit of time.\u201d\n\nYes, CNN this is how you insert a quote. You name the person you are quoting. That said, how does this create a separate system to handle these crimes. This quote is so random too. What is this in reference to. The article never discusses any sort of time delay in implementation. \n\n> He said he didn\u2019t \u201cwant to bore you with detail here,\u201d but that basically, \u201cthis change required a completely different shift in the way these crimes are investigated and prosecuted by taking them outside the chain of command, which already had existing protocols in place in existing judicial system.\u201d\n\nNo! The details are important. Explain how things will work instead of pulling a Todd Howard. How is it going outside the chain of command? This still hasn't been explained! Where does this office fall under? \n\n> He also pointed out that Congress had given the administration until December 2023 to make the change and it was completed five months early. Kirby said the administration was \u201cvery proud\u201d of being ahead of deadline.\n\nThis really should have been mentioned earlier with the quote about time. In fact, it probably should have all been bundled together with the part about the NDAA of 2022. Then it would all be told in one paragraph. \n\n> In a statement following the signing, New York Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand \u2013 who, along with Republican Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa, led a bipartisan push in Congress to remove prosecution of sexual assault from the military chain of command \u2013 applauded Friday\u2019s executive order, writing while it may take time to see results of the new system, \u201cthese measures will instill more trust, professionalism, and confidence in the system.\u201d\n\n> The senior administration official took care to acknowledge Gillibrand\u2019s work on the issue ahead of the order\u2019s signing, calling her \u201ca leader for decades in calling attention to the need to reform the military justice system in a way that\u2019s fairer and more just \u2013 particularly for sexual assault survivors.\u201d\n\n> According to the administration, Gillibrand was influential in leading the charge to expand the scope of crimes covered by the independent counsel beyond sexual assault to also include murder, manslaughter and kidnapping \u2013 changes ultimately reflected in Friday\u2019s executive order.\n\nNow it just seems like a PR piece for Gillibrand. Its an claim of leadership in the Senate, how we don't know, followed by a quote from the unreasonably anonymous source, followed by a paraphrase from a completely unreferenced individual. Is it a paraphrase of multiple people, thus the use the plural body \"the Administration?\" \n\n> In addition to formalizing the rules governing the OSTC, Friday\u2019s executive order will also establish prosecutorial decisions made by special trial counsel as wholly independent from the chain of command; \n\nMeaning what though? \n\n> update procedures the administration says will ensure protections for victims before, during, and after court martial proceedings; and alter the court-martial sentencing system to \u201cpromote uniformity and fairness.\u201d\n\nSo rather than read and relay the actual updates, you just give us the unsupported claims of the admin. Again, unsourced paraphrasing and quote. \n\n> \u201cWhat this executive order does is it really creates the rules of the road for an absolutely brand-new class of independent military prosecutors, and creates the independent authority and the command reporting structure of the Offices of Special Trial Counsel, that very importantly \u2013 and this was in the 22 NDAA \u2013 will report without intervening authorities directly to the civilian service secretaries of each military service,\u201d a second official said Thursday.\n\nWhy is there a second anonymous official? Why is this anonymous? This isn't a leak! Why does the administration need this to be anonymous? If the person isn't anonymous, why are they being reported as such? \n\n> Under the 2022 NDAA, the new changes are set to take effect by December 27, 2023 \u2013 but, per the administration official, the OSTC has already been established within the Department of Defense and is in the process of staffing up.\n\nWhy is this at the end of the article? Why is it just casually thrown in that that is established within the DoD now, and not during the first several claims of being outside the chain of command? Also, where in the DoD? \n\nI give this article an F. Its largely uninformative about what is actually happening and is instead a series of quotes from all over the place. That in itself wouldn't be a failing grade though if the quotes were actually sourced. Additionally, the quotes are so randomly inserted it reads like one of my last minute freshmen essays where I'm trying to meet the page/word count except the author skipped the step where you edit the sentences around the quote in order to frame the quote so it isn't so jarring. Its sadly a very typical article on the subject of politics in which the political actors are put in the spotlight, while the policy (the meat and potatoes of politics; the real star of the show) is only ever referenced to by the actors and never examined by the author or presented to the reader for their own examination. It an uninformative garbage.",

You could probably even say you smoked weed and they would laugh it off or tell you to not say that shit in public.\n\nOf course, if you wind up going for a security clearance or have certain roles within the military, the stakes are higher and there could very well be consequences if it comes up. But once again, unless you actually have it on your record or are such a stoner that your use is widely known it probably will slide right on past. \n\nEither way, your initial chat with the recruiter is just that, a chat and not anything to worry about. He is the last person who is going to rat out a potential marine.\n\nThe official statement happens during MEPS (military inprocessing) and there will be a \"last chance to fess up\" during basic. That is where it counts for real.\n\nWhether you are up front about it and get a waiver (which I know for a fact won't sabotage at least a Confidential security clearance because I know someone who had one for weed) or decide to keep quiet, make that decision and stick with it.

I was able to get a criminal waiver and since I didnt fail any urinalysis I was good to go and went through meps with no issues. I am retired navy now and joined in 99....so the rules might have change. but seriously weed is legal in many states and I bet they dont care or will just be lenient. the military is a great way out of poverty and to get your education paid for. I am only 46 and single so i dont even have to work because I get a paycheck and healthcare for life. all I do is fuck around at home all day, get high, play xbox and listen to kpop BUT I was deployed several times and had to deal with a ton of bullshit but still worth it",
                "So the overall answer is, it depends. Before you join the military you are a civilian and if you're in a state where it's legal then they have to expect that you probably have tried or done some. If you are in a state where it is still illegal that might change things a bit. Keep in mind that the military needs risk takers, but within reason. \n\nSo if you can clean up and pass the drug test, you will be ok. If you do certain jobs within the military like intelligence it may be a deal breaker. Once you are in just forget about any drugs you have done since it is a good way to tank (no pun intended) your career. Also keep in mind that they will give you things like stimulants if you are in combat situations, they are usually known as go pills. \n\nSo once you are in, just say no until you are a civilian again. Until then dry out if you still want to go in.\n\nBonus advice: When you go in pick something that you want to do but while you are in the service, (military job like drive a tank or man a heavy  machine gun) pick a job that has a counterpart in the civilian field so you have experience in a marketable skill when you become a civilian. For example administration, paramedics, coding skills, etc...\n\nIt will make transitioning back to civilian life easier.",

But if candidates are honest, the recruiters will do the tests off the book every couple of weeks until they're clean, so that tgey can pass the official test.",

In every sense of the word, Clark betrayed the United States even while he sat behind a desk paid for by the United States.  Morally, he is more culpable than the crazy private parties (Giuliani, Powell, Eastman, Cheesboro) who were behind Trump because Clark was the only one of them actually collecting a paycheck to support and defend the Constitution from his post inside DOJ.  His attempts to strong-arm the acting attorney general and others into an illegal scheme to defraud voters was, at least to my knowledge, the most perfidious act ever committed by any high-ranking official inside DOJ in its entire history.  When told that his scheme would result in violence in the streets, Clark commented to WH counsel that \"that's what the Insurrection Act is for\", implying that the illegal POTUS would use force to put down protests against his coup, and that if Clark was in charge of DOJ, DOJ would assist in the coup - the Americans who would die in the chaos that would follow the POTUS using violence to carry out his coup d'etat was, for Jeffrey Clark, completely acceptable.\n\nMore than any other defendant (bar Trump), I want to see Clark in a prison cell.

When those people were asked why they never went to mental health, they explicitly said they didn\u2019t want to be made fun of or their secret to be used against them. \n\nIt\u2019s anecdotal, I know, but it\u2019s something that people have to realize. The on base mental health clinic will be staffed by people you will have a higher likelihood of encountering outside of a professional setting than you would in the civilian sector. There\u2019s not much of a chance of you seeing your off base mental health counselor at an optional function. But in the military, so many of our optional functions aren\u2019t really optional. Attendance is at least expected if not overtly required. So you have a much higher chance of running into those people you\u2019ve told your mental health or medical issues to than if you went off base.",

Or when the Air Force suddenly gets rid of all the depth perception waivers for a flying job that clearly doesn\u2019t need one (didn\u2019t even have a window, just 2d computer screen) and you have to wait for ACC to approve waivers again and then wait to get them routed\u2026\n\nTL;DR\nYes, but depends on your job.",

This is extremely common in the aviation community.\n\nIn the aviation community, we don't speak up or get seen because the administration process is just too drawn out to be constantly going back to the docs weekly or monthly. That mixed with limited training will legitimately screw up your career progression, getting you \"kicked out\" of the squadron for a FAC tour because people behind you are now being faced with the same problems and they now take priority in the training pipeline.\n\n This ends up leaving you with little flight experience, meaning both the civilian and military career fields are essentially over or severely delayed.\n\nOh and if you get medboarded out. The FAA is gonna have some serious questions likely deny your flight status too.\n\nSo it's not necessarily that we look weak on our side, it's that you are messing up your career, and as a young professional that won't stay in the military forever, we forget that our health should take priority over our careers.",

It's extremely rare for servicemen to go to mental health unless they get caught doing something dumb, or they are ordered to go by their boss. Mental health doesn't have confidentiality - so anything you say, any diagnosis made, and any record of your visits can be relayed to your chain of command and documented on your record.

                "So Larry Warren was telling the truth the entire time. \n\nHe got discredited hard, but another airman named Adrian Bustinza has [since corroborated his story as well.](https://youtu.be/rEnqJLmhxIQ)\n\nIf you want to hear Larry tell the story in detail, his [Sirius Disclosure interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYU_tr5K5ws) is very sincere. The way he describes personnel gathering and filming it would have been a liability to the truth of his account, but he was adamant that there were a lot of people and equipment there and that it was filmed from multiple angles. He also talks about how Burroughs was injured by jumping on and throwing his arms around one of the smaller personal vehicles that came out of the UFO, a detail I've never heard Burroughs mention. Burroughs did indeed have health problems from being exposed that night, and there was a long saga of him trying to get healthcare for his unacknowledged injuries, but Burroughs only talks about the second night in the woods with Penniston. As far as I am aware, Burroughs has never mentioned coming into physical contact with any of the craft in the woods, but this detail really stood out to Larry Warren, who apparently witnessed it.\n\nFor the record, I think Penniston is lying about the ASCII code he \"received\" from the craft, but I always believed Warren's account of the expected arrival that occurred the next night. Aside from being implausible that aliens or future humans would transmit in unencrypted ASCII instead of just using alphanumeric characters, Penniston just sounds like a liar when he talks about it. It's like claiming the aliens left you a secret message that can only be read using a secret decoder ring from a cereal box. It's just unnecessary and isn't going to obfuscate the message from anyone who matters.\n\nLarry just seemed to have been so obviously traumatized by the experience and his treatment afterwards. He sometimes comes off as an asshole, but I don't blame him, really. He had his mind blown and then got the proverbial shit kicked out of him while he was down. Then he was discredited and accused of lying until someone finally came forward and corroborated him years later.\n\nHere is another video of [Warren walking around on-site](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3CcX9_x8qU) recounting the experience. He never struck me as insincere about his experience. What he says also comports with accounts other military personnel have since given regarding their treatment after witnessing an alien event.",

                "Okay, I'll be the asshole and take all the downvotes here.  \n  \nFirst, I'm from New York.  Have you ever tried to find a public restroom in the city?  It's virtually impossible.  So much so that there's an app for finding publicly-available bathrooms.  Yes, it can be tough in busy areas of Dallas when there's no restroom available, but using the restrooms of private businesses is a privilege, not a right.  \n    \nSecond, Serious Pizza is getting way too much flack here.  For those who have been in Deep Ellum during nighttime and late hours, you know the area is teeming with the homeless.  No, they're not all bad, and yes, some of them just need a hand.  But a private business owner has the right to refuse someone off the street access to their restrooms.  While there is case law to support a person urinating or even defecating in public based on a biological need, there is no such case law or statute to support a business being required to allow the public use of its facilities.  Is it shitty?  If you think so, protest with your wallets.  Just remember to ask yourself how you'd feel as a business owner, which many of you may very well be.  Also, for those who have been to Serious Pizza, do you know how busy it gets during peak hours?  Is the cashier supposed to vet the legitimacy of each and every person who comes in and says, \"I'm a disabled vet, I have a medical condition, and I need to use the restroom,\" and wave the person in?  Is it the pizza cook's job?  Maybe the busboy's?  \n  \nThird, the fact that Serious Pizza has decided to hire cops - two, in fact - to work off-duty security at the business should be an indication that they (a) have a genuine interest in safeguarding themselves from liability because (b) security issues in the area have necessitated the cost.  Picture this.  You own a shop in Neighborhood X.  You're already operating on razor-thin margins.  But the neighborhood is now presenting some safety challenges.  If a mentally ill or dangerously intoxicated person enters your business causes harm to your patrons, you may be liable for neglecting your standard duty of care.  So you pay two cops $55 an hour each, sometimes more, to stand guard.  You do this so the pizza cook, cashier, busboys and dishwashers don't have to deal with people asking to use the bathroom.  And you have a policy on public restroom use specifically because of these potential threats to your customers' safety, so you give the cops that you hire and pay what your marching orders are.  What happens when they disregard your policies?  Feel like your hard-earned money is worth it now?  \n  \nFourth point - onto the cops.  In reading the story, it appears that Mr. Lane, after being told he could not use the restroom, tried to plead with them.  The cops were working off-duty security.  Pausing there for a moment, those officers work for and their checks are signed by Serious Pizza.  If the management has told them, \"Hey, no public restrooms,\" what right do the cops have, legally, to say, \"Nuh-uh, we're letting him use it anyway?\"  What duty do the cops have to vet Mr. Lane's claims?  Are they going to examine his paperwork that he allegedly had with him at the time of the encounter?  The officers are there legally and for a specifically designated purpose.  Then they make the decision to allow another person to essentially make free use of the facilities.  Analogous scenario: the officers are inside your business taking your report for some offense that occurred.  Someone comes off the street, asks to use the restroom, and claims it as a medical necessity.  The officers, against your protestations, decide to let him use the restroom.  The officers should, absent some articulable, exigent circumstance or probable cause, be bound by the limitations set in place by the private property owner in almost every circumstance.  To allow someone from the public to disregard those limitations and use the restroom against the owner's wishes is tantamount to suborning criminal trespass.  Would it be the same if the owner said, \"I don't want that guy using my bathroom because of his race, gender, ethnicity, creed, origin, or nationality?\"  Different circumstances that would be far shittier and not the case here.  Had they let him use the bathroom, Serious Pizza becomes pissed, fire the cops, complain to DPD, and an investigation is initiated.  Damned if you do and damned if you don't?  \n  \nFifth - Are these cops dicks for laughing and chuckling?  That's for most people to decide and, based on a subset of the 63 comments in this post, it appears that most people think they are.  Okay, let's grant that \"gallows humor,\" which cops have to develop to deal with a huge chunk of what they have to see and bear witness to, is an unacceptable excuse for laughing.  But the laughter was captured after their interaction with Mr. Lane.  Their impropriety or poor taste was only discovered after Mr. Lane filed his complaint and DPD administration pulled the video.  Yes, they're shitty for laughing.  Cops have laughed after dealing with murder scenes.  Cops laugh after a fatality crash.  Cops laugh after arresting people.  80% of the time, the persons involved in these incidents never hear it.  This is what happens during an eight-, ten-, or twelve-hour police shift.  Cops laugh.  And sometimes it's inappropriate.  And sometimes it's cruel and inhumane.  But Mr. Lane didn't experience this.  He was frustrated they didn't let him use the restroom, called 911, complained after the fact, and the video was found.  Crappy behavior by the cops?  Sure.  Did it *directly* affect Mr. Lane at the time of the interaction?  No.  \n  \nAnd finally, let's talk about that 911 call.  Mr. Lane used an emergency service line to call the cops ... on the cops.  The officers working this off-duty were uniformed, readily identifiable as sworn police officers, and were properly acting under color of authority as representatives of their private employer.  Any reasonable and prudent person would have, when faced with the same or similar circumstances, readily identified these officers as police and, thus, would be expected to submit to their legal authority, where applicable.  For example, if someone is detained for shoplifting by a cop working an off-duty at Target and the detained individual intentionally provides fictitious identifying information, that would be an offense under 38.02, Penal Code.  Mr. Lane did not like the answer that the off-duty officers gave so he wasted valuable emergency response resources, drawing a response by an on-duty unit of two officers.  Two-man elements in Dallas can be sent to Priority 3 and, in certain instances, Priority 2 and 1 calls, thus freeing up other elements.  But instead, these on-duty officers were used because a private citizen did not agree with the policies of a private business.  Analogous scenario time: a Karen in a restaurant who is not a veteran and but claims she has a medical condition demands to use the bathroom at Serious Pizza, is told \"no\" by off-duty officers working there, and then turns around and calls 911.  Would you view her in a different light?    \n  \nTL;DR: Cops who laughed might be assholes but never did so in the citizen's face and were operating in their official capacity, authorized to do so, and bound by the instructions of their private employer.  The bathroom policies of Serious Pizza, a private business legally operating in a busy Downtown area rife with vagrancy, drug use, and high crime, are open to interpretation by its customers, who can choose whether or not to patronize them based on their personal feelings.  \n  \nWhat laws or policies were actually violated?",
                "Of course this is horrible. But I also know that cops are exposed to the worst of humanity daily. I wonder how many times did they deal with someone who was drunk or high out of their mind, who demanded to use a restroom, only to pass out there, or throw up,  or defecate and piss on the floor.",

Personally i would argue - thanks to modern combat medicine - it's at the lower scale so somewhere near or just above 200k.\n\nNow we can walk around the edge of this move, but this seems to be a scapegoat attempt. The statement by Zelensky that untrained men were sent to the front perceives that they lost the counteroffensive because of this. No, the untrained men go to flanks to sit in trenches, and are told to hold out. The soldiers who were sent to attack with vehicles in those prodding Soviet style attacks were Western trained and were specifically trained not to do what they did. Zelensky should have fired the generals and commanders who still adhere to soviet style thinking.\n\nNothing says \"Ukraine is winning the heroic war\" when you're sacking your entire chiefs of staff for bribery, your entire military recruitment department, your head officials are buying 7 figure luxury real-estate mansions across the Mediterranean, Israel and United States. \n\nTruth eventually comes out and the remaining Ukrainian men as well as veterans, many whom believed their televisions filled with propaganda, are going to be very angry.",

                "For CPU and motherboard combo, AMD is going to provide better price-to-performance than Intel. Looks like you're going for a budget build, so the AMD 5600 and 5600X are going to be great choices for CPU (you can go even cheaper with the 5500 and use a B450 motherboard, even though those components use Gen 3 PCIe lanes\u2014which is still plenty for gaming).\n\nThat's a top choice CPU cooler for the mid and budget level PC build. Well done there.\n\nWith cases, consider how many fans (if any) are included. Sometimes it's cheaper to pay a little more for a case that has fans in it, then to populate an empty case with separate fan purchases (although a $30 five-pack of Arctic P12 fans is about the best bang for buck you can get). Consider buying a used case as well, which could save you some money or allow you to upgrade to a better quality case for the same price as a new cheaply made one.\n\nFor storage, try the Silicon Power A60 1TB m.2 ssd for $35 (for the 2TB version for $65).\n\nFor RAM, you can save about $15 by going with Silicon Power again, and that's if you get 32GB, which you don't really need for a low end budget build. 16GB will be enough, but if it's only a few dollars difference, 32 is fine (at 2300 CL16 or 3600 CL18\u2014just get whichever is cheaper because they perform the same).\n\nFor the power supply, you could get a Thermaltake Toughpower GX2 600 watt for $65. It's rated C tier on the PSU cultist list, and anything C tier or better is perfectly suitable for a budget build (avoid anything below C tier).\n\nFor B550 motherboards, you could go with a $90 Gigabyte B550M DS3H micro-ATX board, or if you go with a 5500 CPU, the $80 ASUS Prime B450M-A II micro-ATX board. These will allow you to look at micro-ATX cases as well, which are smaller and easier to move around if your body is on the go a lot.\n\nAll of this will free up your budget for the best GPU you can afford, which is the best way to go for a gaming PC.",

                "They are getting desperate for more meat for the grinder. All the smart young men who could afford it are \u201con vacation\u201d somewhere else.",
                "Article:\n\nJuly 25 (Reuters) - Russia's lower house of parliament voted on Tuesday to raise the maximum age at which men can be conscripted to 30 years from 27, increasing the number of young men liable for a year of compulsory military service at any one time.\n\nLast year, Russia announced a plan to boost its professional and conscripted combat personnel by more than 30% to 1.5 million, an ambitious task made harder by its heavy but undisclosed casualties in Ukraine.\n\nThe new legislation, which comes into effect on Jan. 1, means men will be required to carry out a year of military service, or equivalent training during higher education, between the ages of 18 and 30, rather than 18 and 27 as now.\n\nThe law also bans men from leaving Russia from the day they are summoned to a conscription office. In April, legislation was passed allowing conscription summonses to be served online instead of in person.\n\nCompulsory military service has long been a sensitive issue in Russia, where many men go to great lengths to avoid being handed conscription papers during the twice-yearly call-up periods.\n\nConscripts cannot legally be deployed to fight outside Russia and were in theory exempted from a limited mobilisation last autumn that gathered at least 300,000 men with previous military training to fight in Ukraine - although some conscripts were sent to the front in error.\n\nHowever, Russia unilaterally claimed four Ukrainian regions as its own last September, in a move not recognised internationally, fuelling fears that raw conscripts could now legally be sent into battle.\n\nSeparately, the legislation passed on Tuesday gives Russian governors the power to set up regional paramilitary units during periods of mobilisation or martial law.\n\nThese units would be funded and armed by the state and given the right to shoot down drones, fight enemy sabotage groups and conduct counter-terrorist operations.\n\nAndrei Kartapolov, a former general who chairs the defence committee of the lower house, the State Duma, said the changes would formalise the creation of militias.\n\nThe topic has gained importance since an abortive armed mutiny last month by Yevgeny Prigozhin's Wagner mercenary force, which is largely funded by the state but fought in Ukraine as a unit with broad autonomy.\n\n\"The people's militia - how it will operate, who it will consist of ... it is absolutely clear and understandable,\" Kartapolov told lawmakers.",

                "Not interesting. Doesn\u2019t change anything. \n\nWe all know Russia has infinite meat. \n\nBy which I don\u2019t mean that literally (on the contrary, they\u2019re facing demographic collapse) but that something else is about to run out, making the amount of meat they have materially irrelevant.\n\nThe bad news for Russia is that infinite meat pitted against finite artillery, artillery wins. **Always**.\n\nThe question isn\u2019t where they take kalashnikovs, shovels or one hand grenade to give this meat. That Kalashnikov, shovel or one hand grenade will never see use.\n\n**It\u2019s where they take howitzers.**\n\nIf you were wondering how that\u2019s going\u2026 the answer is most definitely **not infinite**. \n\nThey\u2019ve gone through (read: worn out) approximately 6000 barrels based on the estimated number of shells they fired, and lost around 4000 pieces so far (those two numbers do partially overlap). There are about 5500 pieces less in visible storage than before the war.\n\n[They have approximately 12,000 remaining in storage yards, about one third self propelled and two thirds towed.](https://youtu.be/EVqHY5hpzv8) Much of this is stuff that\u2019s **the better part of one century old**, some has been actively used in anger in a world war, and is far beyond repair or use. Much of it is likely to be cannibalised for parts and we see evidence of this happening. A sensible guess would be that one half of it can be turned into some kind of working order or into barrel replacement for an active gun. \n\nThey also have an estimated 1-2 thousand pieces deployed across the front lines.\n\nThe burn rate from attrition as of the last month or so is in the order of 30 lost a day. The burn rate from them using up their barrels is in the order of 20-50 per day, though that may have recently decreased.\n\nThere are other complications, such as it being the wrong caliber, the slow rate that mothballed rust can be turned into working pieces on a moving train, as well as sourcing enough shells and getting them delivered to the barrels without being blown up on a train or ammo depot en-route, but let\u2019s ignore that.\n\nLet\u2019s assume 6,000 of those 12,000 can be made operational instantly using Kremlin standard-issue magic wands, and teleported to the front lines using Kremlin standard-issue scrolls of teleportation without having to worry about trains and bridges. Then, added the generously rounded up 2000 barrels ready in the field, would give us a total of 8000 barrels Ukraine needs to go through, at a combined loss+wear rate of, let\u2019s say, 50 barrels a day. \n\n**That\u2019s 160 days.**\n\nNow just to be clear, I\u2019m not saying there will be zero after that long, as they grow thin their loss rate will taper off - but they will become fewer and far between, the same as tanks have become, and their ability to hold back the Ukrainian advance from coming close enough (to themselves shell the living crap out of the Russian trenches) will be all gone. \n\nThen Russia\u2019s infinite meat is rushing (or sitting) into artillery fire without the backing of their own artillery.\n\n**Even if you had Infinite meat, it would not help you, Russia.**",

The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist. \" -  President Dwight D. Eisenhower\n\nCorruption pure and simple.  One of the stinging complaints that Soviets had about the United States is that it's not a really good democracy.\n\n>\" America resembles more closely the horrid fantasy of Orwell's *Nineteen Eighty-Four* than the country we know. The America in Soviet propaganda is ruled by force and fraud. Its handful of rulers pull the strings to which their subjects dance like puppets. Its domestic policy is one of exploitation and oppression and its foreign policy is characterized by deception and aggression. \"\n\nMore or less, it's a corporate oligarchy with a military.  From the 1950s forward, funding the military at the scale we do is a form of corporate socialism that just feeds into occasionally questionable foreign policy decisions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nExpanded: \n\n>The child and prime beneficiary of this system is the infamous \"military-industrial complex,\" the \"monopoly weapons manufacturers\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. top military brass\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. and the bureaucrats and scientists specializing in weapons design.\" This \"reactionary alliance,\" writes G. A. Trofimenko, head of the USA Institute's Foreign Policy Department, is \"the most bellicose grouping\" in the capitalist system, whose \"vested interest in the arms race\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. \\[has\\] sharply intensified\" the bourgeoisie's \"general class aspirations toward militarism.\" Thus the \"military-industrial complex\" is seen to play the role of a \"constant catalyst of militarist processes and military adventures.\"**\\[48\\]** The main objectives of this unwholesome gang are \"an increase in the share of the national budget earmarked for military purposes\u2014the creation and retention on a permanent basis of a wartime economy and wartime business conditions.\" Given these purposes, \"tension and world conflicts play into the hands of the military-state monopoly grouping.\"**\\[49\\]**  \n>  \n>It is not, however, the \"military-industrial complex\" alone which profits from an aggressive foreign policy.

                "Well... the US are not a democracy. They stopped being one when lobbying became a fundamental piece of American politics. It's proven that US politicians only listen to the rich 1%, which acts through campaign donations and other favours, where the relationship with the lobbyists is key.\n\nSo, from that perspective, the US became an agglomerate of industry verticals carving out their space. The Industrial Military complex is the most powerful of them, because weapons are, pardon the pun, the bomb when it comes to profitable goods (not on the black market). And it has always had an easy time pushing its needs through the excuse of National Security. Don't get me wrong, there is a reasonable amount of National Security reasons to keep some stuff secret. But that's system has been hijacked over the decades, with the complacency of politicians because of the aforementioned lobbying system.\n\nLook at the rumour saying that most retrieved crafts have just been gifted to private airspace contractors. That's the classic example. Strong industry > strong government support.\n\nThe Oil and Coal Industry is still the most powerful outside mandated bodies like the military. Energy is the other side of the UAP equation. It started when the Ministry of Energy received more power of secrecy (because of nuclear, of course), which allowed them to escape FOIA.\n\nIt's a huge mess. We're talking 80 years of rogue groups.

                "I like to think of it like this:\n\nCan you imagine a scenario in your own perosonal life where you would break the law in order to \"do the right thing\"?\n\nI think most of us would say \"yes of course\", it just might depend on the specifics of the situation and our own moral codes.\n\n\"The Government\" is not a person, but it is made up of people (obviously). Is it so hard to believe that some small groups of people within the government may try to circumvent the laws in order to do what they think is \"the right thing\"? Now, YOU might disagree with them about whether it actually is the right thing or not, but you can hardly blame them IF they sincerely believe in what they are doing.\n\n**If you were in a position inside the government to \"do the right thing\", but it meant breaking a law or hiding something from Congress.....would you do it? As I said, that will depend on the specifics of the situation and your personal morals/values/beliefs.**\n\nNot to get TOO political but.....its kind of like the idea of having violent protests. Violent protests have to be illegal, otheriwse any lunatic with a minor gripe could justify their violence. But sometimes violent protest is \"necessary\" in that it appears to be the only way to get things done or \"make things right\". The American Revolutionary War (and the events that led up to it) would be an example of this (obviously from the perspective of the American colonists). So you violently protest and you take the risk that you might get put in jail or executed, but you take that risk because \"its the right thing to do\". So the violence has to be illegal, but it also \"must occur\".\n\nTo get back to UFOs.....you need to make laws that keep people in the government from haivng secret programs and black ops type things. All government agencies should be beholden to the voters and Congress. If not, then any lunatic in the governemnt could justify their pet project by claiming \"in the interest of national security\" as their justification. BUT.....there could be cases where bypassing Congress actually does make sense (to you). Maybe the Jason Bourne super-soldier program needs to be kept from Congress \"for the greater good\". Maybe the development of advanced AI for military applications needs to be kept secret from Congress for strategic reasons. Maybe developing viruses in labs is illegal, but the risks to humanity and of being arrested are worth it to the people that run the program in secrecy. For the greater good they would say.\n\nOf course, you can hide nefarious or selfish intent behind the excuse of altruism. So, who knows. My point is, there COULD be good reasons to have \"dark programs\", but those programs MUST be officially declared  illegal. So if they MUST be illegal, but there exists a group of people within the government (or outside of it) who perceive a moral imperitive for the program to exist (illegally), then the program MUST (from their point of view) be hidden from the public and the people who make the laws. Because its \"the right thing to do\".\n\nOf course, the justification for the existence of such a program is just a subjective rationalization made by the people who believe that the program is more important than following the letter of the law, but you might find that there is a reason to hide X program that you actually agree with as well. It would depend onthe specifics of the situation and your personal morals/values/beliefs.",

                "All these numbers are mind boggling as to the amount of losses the Moscovians are willing to sustain.  Unfortunately, I think they are willing to sustain even more.  \n\nPutin does not care about anything but power.  He is willing to allow every man, woman and child in both Moscovia and Ukraine to die. He simply does not care.  I believe he will continue to allow these massive losses until a few things happen. 1) The people of Moscovia stand up and start to rebel and kill Putin. 2) The US Presidential elections are over and Trump is not elected president.  Putin believes Trump will pull the US support for the war. (In my opinion I believe Putin was counting on his re-election when he was planning his invasion. But I digress).  3) The world puts a stop to the war.  Meaning that real sanctions are put into place against Moscovia and those countries directly and indirectly supporting Moscovia. NATO implements a no fly zone, India/China and other nations are forced to stop buying cheap Moscovian oil and reselling it.\n\nI have gotten to know some Ukrainian refugees that live near us.  We have helped them as best we can. They are AMAZING WONDERFUL people.  They are are always smiling, positive and grateful.  It makes me sad that they must endure this awful war.  But we need to understand and be prepared for it to go for a while. WWII in Europe didn't end until Hitler was dead.  I don't see how this is different.",

The single most decisive factor in any war is popular support.\n\nBut it seems Ukraine is willing to risk this, and has adopted a gradual approach. A kind of \"boiling the frog\" so to speak. Each minor attack helps normalize additional attacks in the minds of Russians until the Ukrainians are able to wage complete war on Russian territory without inciting much anger in the Russian population. It's smart though risky, but they might not have much choice.\n\nIt also might help normalize this and allay fears in their allies providing equipment. This may eventually allow the Ukrainians to be allowed more complete use of the weapons provided to them as the need continues to build.",

If we're just talking military agreements I doubt Russia could offer much and considering putins intentions/interests and wagner being a brutal pack of uncontrollable demons I'm weary of whether Africa should align themselves with them.\n\nWhilst I'm personally not sold on China being purest in their intentions I guess the genocidal tendancy of the west isn't present but when it comes to microchips, electronics, and fuel etc China has a vested interest in getting into Africa for their own gain for the present resources. Hopefully, china puts Africa first in the deals made instead of being another boot crushing African prosperity.\n\nI guess only time will tell if the extent of these partnerships favours Africa more than foreign powers. What I hope is that deals are made where Africa is actually in control of their natural resources, labour, and money instead of north american and european mining and oil companies aren't gutting the continent and then destabilising nations when their capital interest is threatened. \n\nI hope Africa not only keeps its history close but also look at libya which was destroyed only in 2011. A move towards pan-africanism, resources nationalisation, anti-imperialism, socialism, and Africa first is the most ideal scenario in my opinion.\n\nLamumba, magufuli, mko abiola, sorrowiwa, Mandela, gaddafi, sankara and others must all be remembered lest history continues to repeat itself till Africa is gutted by capitalism and incinerated by climate change.\n\nEdit:\n\nDon't forget Mali aswell. France has no qualms regarding putting troops on the ground and neither does America. I hope that pan-african alliances act as a meaningful deterrent towards France attacking niger.

I chose a major (electrical engineering) that would be directly beneficial to my future self in terms of job security and compensation. I worked internships that would give me more opportunities post-graduation to quickly secure full-time employment. We (vets) function at our best when we have a mission to accomplish.

While your friends are a year or two into their careers, a significant chunk of their paycheck are probably going to student loans.\n\nExposure to different people, cultures, leadership styles, customs and traditions.  When you enter your career,  you will quickly surpass many if your peers by your ability to deal with stress, react to pressure, tolerate different 'personalities' and drive through challenges.  These are the skills the military taught you, whether you know it or not. \n\nDiscipline to get through stupid, irrelevant courses and job tasks.  You're not sweeping the deck in the middle of a sandstorm, or mopping up the rain, or any other stupid ass task some high strung NCO had you do for fun. You know that taking ancient art history is just part of the curriculum,  something that has to be done to get to the next level. It doesn't bother you, you've done a lot worse for much less.\n\nYou might have seen parts of the world others never will, and have a compassion for humanity that others struggle to find. Or just a different perspective on where people come from and how blessed we are to be where we are.\n\nWhere would you be without the military experience? Me? I would not have gone to college. I might have gone to a highlybranked culinary school  gotten into 10s of thousands in debt, graduated inn2008, entering the workforce at the peak of the 2008-09 recession.  Probably would have been laid off, had to move back home, and be trying to pay off debt while working at something like an Applebee's. Instead,  I now have an engineering degree,  manage 100mil construction projects, make a solid 6 figure salary and get to have a nice, comfortable life. \n\nWhere would you be.

                "I enlisted at 20, got out just after my 25th birthday, started terminal leave, and within a week of moving back to my home state I enrolled at a great community college. Earned my AA, transferred to a four-year school, and had my BA by 29. \n\nNot once did I ever feel like I was \u201cbehind\u201d my peers from high school. If anything, I fucking love that I was able to serve, gain tons of life experience, and THEN start college. Few reasons why:\n\n1) the Marines instilled discipline in me that was severely lacking before. Short story short, but I was academically suspended freshman year of college because I just didn\u2019t give a fuck and smoked pot and chased girls. Went from that to graduating with a 3.6 GPA for my AA and a 3.8 for my BA\n\nI had more than one professor tell me that veterans were their favorite students\n\n2) the portfolio I was able to build in the Marines (war correspondent) played an integral role in future employment. Also, having an MOS that taught real-world skills and could be easily transferred to the civilian sector \n\n3) I\u2019ll be blunt: I was a single guy who had been to more than a dozen countries and had ample life experience at 25. Owned a condo, drove a nice car, mature, etc. And I was surrounded by 19-22 year old women who liked that about me. \n\nPussy on a slingshot. I barely had to try\n\nErgo, it\u2019s all a matter of perspective. I wouldn\u2019t consider you behind your peers; you\u2019ve more than likely done and seen things they never will.

He has gotten me two major promotions because of work ethic, and quite frankly because we have a bond due to being Marines.

                "you're comparing apples to tables.  It's very different.\n\nAnd, once you get away from all the college kids, you will feel much less like a teenager.\n\nAnd many employers will actually appreciate that you have military service, as long as you learn to couch it in the terms they understand.  Leadership, ability to work alone or in groups, co-ordination with diverse elements.  yay buzzwords!!",
                "I mean, it depends on so many variables and the way you see them. For starters, how many of your peers actually got to start their careers right out of college? Let alone at the positions they want.\n\nWhile you were in, how many of them were struggling just to make it through financially and are still dealing with loans and debt?\n\nIf you know how to effectively write a resume, then you can translate many of the skillsets you've acquired over your enlistment to something better 'read' by a civilian HR rep.\n\nAnd then there are the slew of benefits that you get to reap. Things like VR&E, if you rate it, can actually put you ahead of your peers. \n\nA bachelor's isn't what it used to be. It is, in fact, over saturated in today's pool of applicants. So, having experience and even just a way into a masters or any other high learning actually puts you ahead in the end.",

School was free, helped a lot of kids recognize the importance of education and a lot of professors learn about students playing them.",
                "I had the same exact feeling when I was getting out and for the first few years as a civilian. And I had a 5-year enlistment too, so tack on another year of \"left-behindness.\"\n\nI can't say when it exactly happened, but those feelings did eventually completely go away. And in fact, I would say that I've come from behind and surpassed most of the friends that I thought were so far ahead of me back then. Now I'm 40 yo, been out of the USMC for 17 years, and I'm a world-renowned expert in a field that has NOTHING to do with what I did in the corps. And I get paid a pretty decent amount to do it.\n\nIf I was going to give advice to my 23-year-old, fresh out of the military self, I would say to keep your head down and focus on learning as much as you can, getting as good as you can in your chosen field, and take full advantage of this time. It's very rare to have a few years like this where you can dedicate yourself 100% to self improvement and growth. Don't let your worries about keeping up with your friends ruin that for you.",

It's a journey, so catch a wave and enjoy not being an 22 year old forced into a wage slave system in a career they don't even know they will like or not. \n\nNot to mention, when they go out of college, they will be lost again. \n\nYou are actually ahead of schedule, if you just change your mindset.",

I started taking classes my second year into the Marines and graduated about a month after I got it. My service was also able to push me ahead of other candidates where Im constantly working with individuals who are older then me yet Im managing them. All this to say I only joined because I flunked out of school in the first place. \n\nMilitary service I found is hard to push on resumes unless you reword a lot of what you did so it makes sense to civilians. I was a 2171 \"lens licker\" and I was able to put a lot of \"logistical\" operations that we did for deployment and its how I work in operation now.

Now, over a decade later, I am still just four-years older than some, but I had better opportunities coming out of school because of service and have moved ahead in some ways.\n\nThe biggest difference to this day is the lack of student loans, earlier and more savings for retirement, and home ownership.  I was able to buy a house with nothing down based on my starting salary at a really good time.

All the jobs I have had since I got out hired me based on my experience and also referred to by someone I knew from the service or have been prior service.

Preferential treatment for government job positions if you decided to continue working for the government. And a retirement plan already WELL established if you put away 20% of your paycheck into TSP during your 4 years of service. Which that alone is a huge boost because the amount you put in at an early age in your life will compound into an even higher amount of retirement income when you\u2019re 60.\n\nI understand why taking the non-traditional route to a career after graduating high school can make things seem like you\u2019re falling behind.

It's a lot about marketing, AI, web design, SEO, etc. I'm the least trendy person. I kind of missed out learning emerging technology. The original career I wanted has mutated into something I never wanted to do.\n\nChanging careers seems impossible at this point. I used up my GI Bill and have student loans.

Professionally it can have you starting later on a career, but it definitely offers a financial head-start for a responsible person.  Where it ends up putting people behind is servicemembers who convert their pay instantly into cash, blow it on bullshit, contribute nothing to savings, and have no real ambition for college or career.  In my opinion, they (not the military) are putting themselves behind. Sure it's fun, but those who take that approach should be prepared to stay in the military long term and simply follow the easy path forward, like those with similar non-progressing attitudes in the civilian world do in their jobs.",

Sure, I might be a decade behind retirement from what people my age are looking at, but I got to have an adventure and make some money and really get established without the struggle of living in poverty through my early 20s.

                "Hey folks - sorry but I have actually posted about this a couple of times over the past couple of years here in this thread. I am about to watch a movie with my kids so the abridged version:  \n\n\nTime - May 2008 timeframe  \n\n\nThose involved - myself (68W), my then platoon leader and good friend, 2 other medics  \nWhere: Ft Bragg, Southeast area of Sicily LZ/DZ (Training ground for paratroopers)  \nWhat/When: Shortly after 23:00 we witnessed a **VERY** (I cannot understate this, it looked beautiful against a clear night) run across the **width** of the LZ over us at a fast speed and seemingly around the time it hit the other side of the LZ, it hit HARD right to the North and accelerated/sped off into the distance beyond what we could see.  \nMy team and I, including my LT, just stood there in silence until one of us said WTF and we just... laughed. It was incredibly surreal. Our LT even joked around about shutting up if the men in black show up. Less than 5 minutes after the event, we just kind of laughed it off then saw a convoy of black SUVs on the main gravel road that connected the LZs just zipping down the road with lights out. At that point we stopped laughing and giggled it off while putting out our smokes and going straight to our tents. Surreal is a good way of explaining it. It was like living a cartoon or South Park episode.   \n\n\nWe thankfully never got the pat down or threats, probably because it happened too fast and it was not enough on itself to really be taken serious. The weird part is I saw a random Youtube video years later claiming civilian interactions around that time.",
                "Over the course of discussing recent developments / the upcoming hearing with my girlfriend, she responded by saying\n\n>\"oh! Two years ago me, my dad, and my two brothers were driving down a road around the corner and saw a MASSIVE, triangle-shaped thing with lights all over it hovering over the elementary school. It was completely silent and almost as big as the building. It was super low. We assumed it had something to do with Fort Gordon and kept going home but my brothers and dad went back to check it out a couple minutes later. The entire road was swarming with police and firefighters who asked them why they were on the road so late and then told them to leave before men in black showed up to ask questions when they explained what they saw.\"\n\nI thought she was going to think I was crazy for having an interest in the topic and she drops that on me.\n\nI mention it in this thread because that's one random example from a medium sized city in Georgia where dozens of public safety officers were made aware of.... something. If one of them called a representative, it would help add validity to the importance of investigating the topic.",

                "UAP Sighting while on FTX\n\nI witnessed what I believed at the time were drone fighters flying above our brigade field training exercise (FTX) at night.  They were little points of light literally flying circles around our jets far above, with helicopters below them. The jets would fly towards the \"UAP's\" and the UAP's would dart away and then quickly stop. Then the jets would make a wide loop as they turned back and headed for the UAP's, and the UAP would dart away and then stop. My entire platoon saw it as well as a few other people from our (medical) company, and my Platoon Leader (PL) reported it as a UFO to our battalion Tactical Operation Center (TOC). He actually tried to file a SALUTE report. Someone responded on the radio and told us not to report anything in the air because that was not part of the scope of our battalions training exercise. We did NOT recognize the voice on the radio and IIRC we concluded that it must have been someone from the base hospital monitoring the radio. This is still confusing to me. . My PL only noticed the UAP's because he was using borrowed Night Vision (NODs) to watch our last Medevac (helicopter) leave. The aircraft involved werde too far away to see using the nods.\n\nYears later, a relative of mine who was in the TOC told me that they never saw the report. He slept in the TOC and is also into UFO\u2019s so he said he definitely would have seen our report if it was recorded. \n\nBTW he claims he has seen cigar shaped craft fly over his neighborhood in the past and he believes the cigars are ours because they came from the direction of an AFB. He tried pointing one out to me one night but I didn\u2019t see it. I\u2019ve read that many people who witness UFO\u2019s become \u201cexperiencers\u201d and I definitely am one.\n\nSkepticism note: I don\u2019t know what to make of that sighting. At the time we all believed it was \u201cpilotless aircraft\u201d (now known as \u201cdrones\u201d) that our military was testing and we knew that there were many coordinated FTX\u2019s happening at the same time, so we assumed that we should report what we were seeing happen above us. The PL came to the conclusion that they're either UFO's or our own next-gen tech because they didn't behave like fighters  (jets) or helicopters. We ruled out Harriers (Navy/Marines) because this was strictly an Army, possibly Air Force exercise. We discussed Area 51 but realized that we weren't even in the same state, and the base we were at wasn't known for testing weapons so he just shrugged and said \"Well I hope they're fucking friendlies.\"\n\nThis was at Fort Carson, in Colorado, I believe it was in 1992 or 1993. I have written about this before but left out details in the past.",
                "Reading your story gave me chills. I had a scary similar experience while I was stationed at a Robins AFB, GA. The base had some of the most prime and untouched hunting grounds in the south east. HUGE white tail deer.\n\nI was hunting alone one morning and I got into my tree stand about an hour before first light. While I was several hundred yards away from the parking area, I could still relatively see lights if someone was parking to hunt. The area I was hunting was not well known AT ALL. I had never seen anyone hunt there in the 2 years I hunted the base. This was just as the internet became popular and I was one of few with a computer. I did my research and found hunting areas that nobody knew about.\n\nAnyway's, it was still dark and this bright floating light came above me. At the time I thought maybe it was a helicopter? But I didn't hear the sound of rotary wings. Before I could even analyze my thoughts, it made like a 160 degree rotation and accelerated VERY FAST until I couldn't see it anymore. I was young and just didn't know what to do. Within minutes I hear footsteps on dry leaves. Serveral sets. I listen for this as my main sense of hunting. I know what a deer sounds like. These were not deer and while I may have been just too scared to comprehend, I SWEAR I heard incoherent communication that I couldn't comprehend. \n\nAbout 20 minutes later I see SEVERAL sets of lights coming up to the parking area. A parking area that I have never seen anyone at in probably 30 hunting sessions. They came up the road and as if they saw my truck and got spooked, they left. I saw the lights far in the distance about 10 minutes later. I think they found another way in. I was shaking I was so scared.\n\n\"why didn't you tell anyone, like your CO or supervisor?!\" This is the truth because I can't get in trouble for it now. I didn't get down or tell anyone because I was using a 270 high powered rifle which is HIGHLY illegal in base property. You had to use shotgun with slugs only. If youre a hunter, you know why I didn't want to use that.\n\nAnyways, that's my story that I've never told anyone. OP was near me and was strikingly similar.",

                "I want to see what is going on with crashed UFOs also, but it is unlikely that our government will endanger national security to satisfy our curiosity. If they have successfully reverse-engineered alien artifacts and developed new hyper-weapons and alien propulsion technologies,  there is no way they will freely admit that. The earth is a very dangerous place in our present timeline. Giving adversary nations like China and Russia access to super-weapons capable of destroying the entire planet is probably not a good idea right now.\n\nMaybe, perhaps they could let the world know that we have crashed off-world craft and we have been examining them, but giving our enemies even a hint of what progress we have achieved would only empower them and encourage them to double their efforts to steal our technologies to use them against us and all of the free countries in the world.\n\nThere may be a paramount military, technological goal that they (our government) are close to reaching first, which has not been accomplished yet, and until that point, it would be reckless to disclose anything because we have not established a safe point needed before it can safely be revealed. \n\nTo have made breakthrough discoveries and just recently been able to use that new knowledge to be able to have an insurmountable lead, means that disclosing even a hint of what has been done at this stage could cause all of the hard work that has been done to amount to nothing, if it gets into the wrong hands, just use your imagination.",

                "I\u2019ve posted this on another thread regarding a UFO seen at McGuire airbase: I\u2019ll throw the link in below. Gonna copy and paste what I said there:\n\n\nI'm a Platoon Leader that trains regularly at Ft. Dix/McGuire. My former platoon sergeant and I were chatting one night about UFO's and he told me in January of 2020 before Covid locked down training for a while, they had a ceasefire come over the radio in the middle of a mortar mission.  Range control came on the air and said that an adjacent unit at a nearby range had callled and indicated that an unknown aircraft was flying through the airspace. As such, they could not safely shoot indirect, high angle fire for the time being. As the call came over the radio, range control in a nervous voice said they weren't sure it was an aircraft but that it was \"something flying\". My platoon sergeant grabbed everyone and told them to stop shooting and as he did so, 3 lights flying in formation about 150 feet above the ground passed over the roadway behind them silently.\n\nThe biggest significance of this story to me was that prior to shooting anything into the air, the airspace is cleared at Ft. Dix & McGuire to mitigate risk during training. They know the flight plans of every military aircraft moving through that airspace and get comms up immediately with civilian aircraft that enters. No one in the range control office (or I am assuming at McGuire) knew/expected this aircraft to fly through the airspace that night, leading to an installation wide ceasefire for several minutes.\n\nYour story reminded me of that story my old PSG told me when I was a new platoon leader. Figured I'd share it.",

                "This all seems to me like the \u201cUAP\u201d and human interaction has ramped up a lot since the 40\u2019s. Anyone wonder why? My theory is that they\u2019ve been watching us all along but have taken even further interest in us since we\u2019ve technologically progressed so much. Humans can harness the power of the atom (the building blocks of the universe) for the first time in history and we\u2019re on our way to taking that a step further with nuclear fusion. We\u2019re on the verge of harnessing the power of the atom for energy use, not just for defense purposes, but to power our planet. We could quite possibly advance our society to such a level that we surpass level 1 of the kardeshev scale entirely in an effort to save our planet from human made destruction. The aliens simply want to see what happens, and if our species has what it takes to get through the great filter. Once we do that I believe they will make first contact, even if we come to find out about their existence before then. I\u2019m sure our government still knows more than we do even if it\u2019s not much more, they wouldn\u2019t be the government we know and hate today if they didn\u2019t. If a government does prove their existence, I don\u2019t see how any nation wouldn\u2019t jump to share that news. I honestly think they\u2019re being overtly cautious because they don\u2019t know exactly what \u201cthey\u201d are since we\u2019d likely be getting radio silence back. It would be like a jellyfish trying to figure out what a human is, even with our best and brightest I don\u2019t think they know who or what is visiting us. Only that it is not human. You have to cut through all of this hoopla and the pop culture that has fed us a false image of what aliens are and could be.  We can\u2019t even fathom what a being with the technology or ability to travel here from across the universe or even across the galaxy would look or behave like. Our human body is not able to handle the physical force of velocities that reach the speed of light. If they traveled here it isn\u2019t by any sort of ship we can think of. It\u2019d be something entirely different just like the beings that pilot them. The big question that still remains and has been in the human conscious for millennia is: are we alone? But remember, we wouldn\u2019t be alone by the standards of humans. It would be similar to how we share Earth with jellyfish. Sorry for using jellyfish as an example twice but it really would be that drastic of a difference. We would be primordial to \u201cthem\u201d. This is such an interesting train of thought and I really hope it isn\u2019t all for nothing.",

Eisenhower was also warning about Edward Teller and Von Neumann.\n\n\n-------\n\n\"Akin to, and largely responsible for the sweeping changes in our industrial-military posture, has been the technological revolution during recent decades.\n\nIn this revolution, research has become central; it also becomes more formalized, complex, and costly. A steadily increasing share is conducted for, by, or at the direction of, the Federal government.\n\nToday, the solitary inventor, tinkering in his shop, has been over shadowed by task forces of scientists in laboratories and testing fields. In the same fashion, the free university, historically the fountainhead of free ideas and scientific discovery, has experienced a revolution in the conduct of research. Partly because of the huge costs involved, a government contract becomes virtually a substitute for intellectual curiosity. For every old blackboard there are now hundreds of new electronic computers.\n\nThe prospect of domination of the nation's scholars by Federal employment, project allocations, and the power of money is ever present and is gravely to be regarded.\n\nYet, in holding scientific research and discovery in respect, as we should, we must also be alert to the equal and opposite danger that public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific-technological elite.\n\nIt is the task of statesmanship to mold, to balance, and to integrate these and other forces, new and old, within the principles of our democratic system-ever aiming toward the supreme goals of our free society.\n\n******\n\n \n\nAnother factor in maintaining balance involves the element of time. As we peer into society's future, we-you and I, and our government-must avoid the impulse to live only for today, plundering, for our own ease and convenience, the precious resources of tomorrow. We cannot mortgage the material assets of our grandchildren without risking the loss also of their political and spiritual heritage. We want democracy to survive for all generations to come, not to become the insolvent phantom of tomorrow.\"\n\n******",

Originally set up by the Kenpeitai military police of the Empire of Japan, Unit 731 was taken over and commanded until the end of the war by General Shir\u014d Ishii, a combat medic officer in the Kwantung Army. The facility itself was built in 1935 as a replacement for the Zhongma Fortress, and Ishii and his team used it to expand their capabilities. The program received generous support from the Japanese government until the end of the war in 1945. Unit 731 and the other units of the Epidemic Prevention and Water Purification Department operated biological weapon production, testing, deployment, and storage facilities.\n\nWhile Unit 731 researchers arrested by Soviet forces were tried at the December 1949 Khabarovsk war crime trials, those captured by the United States were secretly given immunity in exchange for the data gathered during their human experiments.[6] The United States covered up the human experimentations and handed stipends to the perpetrators.[1] The Americans co-opted the researchers' bioweapons information and experience for use in their own biological warfare program, much like what had been done with Nazi German researchers in Operation Paperclip.[7][8] On 28 August 2002, Tokyo District Court ruled that Japan had committed biological warfare in China and consequently had slaughtered many residents",

They pawned it off as Okinawans committing group suicide to avoid the crimes that the US soldiers committed, but they were also very much part of the blame. Japanese people used to see us as beneath them, wild, unintelligent, and in the 30s suppressed our culture and forced us to assimilate. My great grandparents changed their last names to more \"Japanese\" last names because they were being rounded up and discriminated against. Traditional Ryukyuan language was banned and Japanese education and language was forced upon the people. Our culture and textiles burned.

Military officials denied the mass rapes, and all surviving veterans refused The New York Times' request for an interview.\\[2\\]  \nProfessor of East Asian Studies and expert on Okinawa Steve Rabson said: \"I have read many accounts of such rapes in Okinawan newspapers and books, but few people know about them or are willing to talk about them\".\\[2\\] Books, diaries, articles and other documents refer to rapes by American soldiers of various races and backgrounds. Masaie Ishihara, a sociology professor, supports this: \"There is a lot of historical amnesia out there, many people don't want to acknowledge what really happened\".\\[2\\]  \nAn explanation given for why the US military has no record of any rapes is that few \u2013 if any \u2013 Okinawan women reported abuse, mostly out of fear and embarrassment. Those who did report them are believed by historians to have been ignored by the U.S. military police. A large scale effort to determine the extent of such crimes has also never been called for. Over five decades after the war has ended the women who were believed to have been raped still refused to give a public statement, with friends, local historians and university professors who had spoken with the women instead saying they preferred not to discuss it publicly. According to a Nago, Okinawan police spokesman: \"Victimized women feel too ashamed to make it public\".\\[2\\]  \nIn his book Tennozan: The Battle of Okinawa and the Atomic Bomb, George Feifer noted that by 1946 there had been fewer than 10 reported cases of rape in Okinawa. He explains that it was: \"partly because of shame and disgrace, partly because Americans were victors and occupiers\".\\[8\\] Feifer claimed: \"In all there were probably thousands of incidents, but the victims' silence kept rape another dirty secret of the campaign\".\\[8\\] Many people wondered why it never came to light after the inevitable American-Okinawan babies the many women must have had. In interviews, historians and Okinawan elders said that some Okinawan women who were raped did give birth to biracial children, but that many of them were immediately killed or left behind out of shame, disgust or fearful trauma. More often, however, rape victims underwent crude abortions with the help of village midwives.\\[2\\]  \nAccording to George Feifer the majority of the likely thousands of rapes were committed in the north, where the campaign was easier and the American troops were not as exhausted as in the south.\\[9\\] According to Feifer it was mostly troops landed for occupation duty who committed rapes.\\[9\\]\"",

No more partially playing along with Western sanctions on Tehran or Pyongyang to appease the U.S.\"\n\nIt's just a funny coincidence because I don't know if this official visit was announced in advance, but if it was I wasn't aware of it and wasn't following the news covering such things in enough specific granular detail apparently, as this comes as a pleasant yet more than welcome surprise. This is the way. Any previous humoring, appeasement, even lip service to U.S.-directed isolation efforts and measures levied against resistant countries outside their geopolitical grip must be forcefully and openly repudiated by Russia everywhere around the world, thrown in the garbage bin, and it made clear that the era of playing along and dancing to that tune is dead and buried.\n\nFrankly, Russia never should have even in part turned its back on these countries for the faint hope of buying time and tolerance from the U.S. and its satellites. It was a fool's errand and they've proven time and time again they want to dominate the Earth and consider even the existence of countries outside their geopolitical and ideological control and grip as an intolerable affront to themselves to launch crusades against. The pace and the ordering is just juggled around as needed, but Russia and China know that if they helped the U.S. fully neutralize or eliminate countries like North Korea and Iran as obstacles, that that would gain them nothing but renewed time, energy, and focus on the part of Washington D.C. and satraps to direct its efforts against them.",

                "Holy sh\\*t. I don't think that enough people realise how downright unhinged this is. Let me give you some brief infos who they were:\n\nThe Dirlewanger Brigade, among other German military units, was responsible for a series of atrocities during World War II, especially in Eastern Europe. Their actions in Poland and the Soviet Union are some of the most horrific examples of wartime brutality.\n\nTheir brutality stands out even among the notorious SS units, which were themselves responsible for many of World War II's most heinous crimes. While several SS formations, especially those involved in behind-the-lines security operations, committed horrendous atrocities, the Dirlewanger Brigade was unique in several respects:\n\n1. **Composition**: Unlike standard Waffen-SS units which were initially composed of ideologically driven volunteers, the Dirlewanger Brigade began as a unit of convicted poachers and expanded to include other criminals, from common felons to violent offenders. Its commander, Oskar Dirlewanger, himself had a criminal record.\n2. **Lack of Discipline**: While the SS was generally known for its discipline (albeit ruthless and brutal), the Dirlewanger Brigade was notoriously undisciplined. Many of its members were violent sociopaths, and their criminal tendencies were often left unchecked.\n3. **Nature of Operations**: The unit was primarily tasked with anti-partisan warfare, which, by its nature, often involved reprisals against civilians. While many German units engaged in brutal anti-partisan warfare, the Dirlewanger Brigade often used these operations as pretexts for gratuitous violence, looting, and other crimes.\n4. **Scale and Sadism of Atrocities**: While many SS units were involved in mass killings, especially of Jews and other \"undesirable\" groups, the Dirlewanger Brigade often committed its atrocities with a particular sadism. The massacre in Wola during the suppression of the Warsaw Uprising in 1944 is a prime example, where tens of thousands of civilians were killed in a matter of days. Witnesses and survivors frequently commented on the unit's extreme cruelty, which included mutilation, rape, and other forms of torture.\n5. **Reputation**: Even within the SS, the Dirlewanger Brigade was known for its brutality. Heinrich Himmler reportedly considered the unit useful for its ruthlessness, but its reputation was such that even other SS members regarded them with a mix of disdain and fear.\n\nComparatively, the \"normal\" Waffen-SS divisions were frontline combat units that participated in many of the major battles on both the Eastern and Western Fronts. While they were involved in war crimes and atrocities, especially on the Eastern Front, their primary function was conventional military combat. The Dirlewanger Brigade, on the other hand, was more often deployed in roles where they directly interacted with (and brutalized) civilian populations.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: They were the worst of the worst sadistic, monstrous demons, even in SS standarts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPS:\n\nThere is a WW2 film from Belarus named \"Come and see\". It is a harrowing portrayal of the Nazi occupation of Belarus during World War II and what the Dirlewanger Brigade did to countless villages. It is avaliable on youtube for free.",

                "Antiquated? No way! we have a brand new unproven fly by wire maritime helicopter. It's only flown full speed into the ocean on its own killing the entire crew and passengers.\n\nA brand new SAR plane that is under powered for the mission load.\n\nBrand new infantry fighting vehicles that catch fire for some reason.\n\nNew over budget and not delivered on time arctic patrol vessels.\n\nStill waiting on, new fighters jets, flight suits, naval uniforms, Martine patrol aircraft, medium lift army helicopters, doctors, mental health professionals, military family resources, enough military housing, on base accommodations, new frigates, new pistols, arctic bases, any kind of anti-aircraft weapons, UAVs, drones, SNCOs and officers that didn't get to their positions through attrition or promoting problems away, having actual career management where the members don't have to move every 2 years to plug holes.\n\nAnd on and on and on.\n\nThen eventually you'll wonder if your boss is a giant pieces of shit sexual harasser or be on the end of that harassment and their buddies in command positions will protect them.\n\nThis is how veterans see the military.",
                "Most??? How do the rest see it?",
                "Of course they do. The media has been shitting all over them for the better part of a decade, and the government has been shitting on them for even longer. \n\nThere has been a lot of bad publicity with the sexual harassment and assault scandals, not to mention the procurement headaches.",
                "I think it\u2019s outdated. Remember when we had THREE aircraft carriers? Or how we almost got a Queen Elizabeth class battleship during the interwar period? \n\nTimes have sure changed.",
                "Underfunded and underappreciated.",
                "I'm close to Meaford Base.  Am close with a lot of military folks. I have stories.  Not good ones. \n\nThe people who serve ... my cap is off to them.\n\nWhat they deal with, though, in terms of equipment and administration?  Crappola",
                "Old and antiquated for sure. Living quarters are atrocious.",
                "most of the kit i wear, i've purchased with my own money",
                "It's one thing to rely on the US for international conflicts and defense, but so many people always forget the military is usually first on scene for natural disasters- sandbagging flood zones, dropping water on fires, evacuation of civilians. Hell during 2020 they had to go care for the elderly in a few provinces because nursing home care was so subpar. Those reasons alone make it a worthwhile investment.",
                "As a veteran it does make a twisted sort of sense why we are so outdated. Canadians/voters do not care about our military. Some day they will and it will be too little too late just like when we first deployed to Afghanistan. Took forever to get equipment and other issues sorted.",
                "Realistically, we don't have a modern functioning military. If we were in dire straits and threatened militarily (on Canadian soil), we'd be absolutely fucked. Only the US/NATO would be in a position defend our borders. \n\nLet's hope that nothing happens on North American soil, because we won't stand a chance if something does.",
                "The Canadian military has a proud history that no one -- not even Canadians -- talks about.\n\nWe fought the Americans in the War of 1812.  We liberated the Netherlands in WW2.  We broke the record for longest sniper shot -- twice.\n\nAnd yet since WW2, our military budget has shrunk -- resulting in a military which became more and more outdated and tiny.  We never got the Avro Arrow built (tbf, the Americans are to blame for that, but still).  We have fewer than 75k troops.  Our equipment is outdated.  We even sent our troops to Poland without cooks at one point!!  And we refuse to meet the 2 percent of GDP goal set by NATO.\n\nEveryone says that Canada isn't in any danger of invasion.  I say, make sure it stays that way.\n\nEDIT: Btw, our PM refuses to pay our veterans what they're worth.  But he has no problem handing money to immigrants hand over fist.",

                "And, on top of it, Canadian Forces don't seem to offer Work From Home, so what's in it for me?\n\n/S",
                "Old and antiquated 100%. We desperately need to invest in our military. With global warming and the arctic melting, other nations will be challenging our arctic sovereignty. Not to mention Canada, a country of just about 40 million (0.5% of global population) has 25% of the world's fresh water. With climate change, climate refugees, etc there will be huge demand for our resources. We need to be in a position where we can defend the country and our countrymen. \n\nIn the near term, we're not meeting our own NATO commitments. Wouldn't surprise me if we're eventually booted from that alliance. For all of Trudeau's talk of \"we stand with Ukraine\" he could have at least spent some $$$ on the military so that we can actually stand with them if/when the need arises.",

                "The CAF falls under DND which is a federal government responsibility. Not to mention to buy anything it has to go through the department of procurement and the treasury board. This process takes 6-15 years. The problem isn\u2019t the CAF it\u2019s the federal government. Stop blaming the CAF. The CAF are crying for equipment and solutions, to the point where it\u2019s embarrassing to serve with allies because we are 30 years behind\u2026\u2026\u2026 if you gave the CAF the money and no restrictions they would have it sorted tomorrow",
                "Our military is an embarrassment because there is no cultural cohesion in our society. The army thinks that by getting ultra progressive, letting you wear nail polish, and pushing out more GBA+ courses on dnd learn they can draw in the modern cohort of young people. The funny thing is almost nobody gives a fuck about other people in our society, fewer than ever would be willing to put their lives on the line for our country because we're a \"post national\" state with no shared identity or purpose. \n\nSo they keep pushing away young (especially white) men, historically the demographic which by far produces the most warfighters in our country, and the leadership is left with a big pikachu face wondering why every unit outside of CANSOFCOM is an undermanned, undertrained, demoralized, and morbidly obese sack of shit. In any kind of near peer conflict, the CAF in its current incarnation would be butchered. It's a federal jobs program and a domestic disaster response force, nothing else.",
                "The Military is experiencing the same kind of austerity that Education and Health Care are getting. This is what happens when you let lobbyists and their cronies run a country for their own profit.\n\nWar, like Love, is ultimately about Economics and at the moment the people of Canada can only afford to cosplay at Traditional war.",
                "Like the concept of having a military? I see it as necessary, not that our politicos agree. How do I see our active military? Well trained with garbage equipment that was obsolete Twenty years ago.",
                "The media constantly bitched about the Seaking,  it was well maintained and now the POS Cyclone is half the chopper the Seaking was. We can't procure anything that could be useful. A useless fixed wing SAR Kingfisher and next Bombadier's CP140 Aurora replacement.  Billions wasted to keep any potential bidders happy.",
                "What do most Canadians even know about the military?",
                "I wish we had a strong military.  Canadians have been groomed to be meek passive for far too long though. Unless they are driving.....",
                "I've had the luxury of never having to give the military much thought one way or another.  To the point that I basically never think of it at all until I see an article like this and remember, \"Oh yeah.  We have a military\".  For most folks it's pretty much, \"out of sight, out of mind\".  I am honestly pretty much completely ignorant about what they do, what they need, what needs to be changed, etc.  I don't know how many people are in the Canadian military or what the budget might be.  I can't be alone.",
                "Search and Rescue,DART, Arctic patrol (land,sea,air), special forces...lots deserve support with best equipment and training. Tanks,bombers...the most expensive stuff is also mostly the least useful in my opinion. Ukraine lesson is that there is $10k kit (eg Javelins, Stingers,drones etc) that is very efficient at taking out $10m armour,planes etc",
                "Of course they would post this article right after the military found mandates unconstitutional.",
                "I see it as underfunded, mismanaged, undermanned and ill-supported by both the government and the citizenry. \n\nAnd the historical accomplishments of our military are far too undercelebrated. \n\nAnd whoever allowed a culture of harassment to grow within the ranks should go to hell. \n\nAround age 20 I was thinking of joining one of the services but opted not to due to bad memories of being in the cadets at age 12 and being personally singled out by one of the 'leaders' for unrelenting verbal abuse, and not the fun colorful tough love shown in typical boot camp scenarios, but rather just personal, deep ugly hate. And I'm told this leader went on to have a lengthy career in our military. I'm so glad I never had to deal with that guy!\n\nAnyway, our foreign adversaries thank us for our cluelessness.",
                "What military?",
                "People worry more about their covid vaccine status than they do their capabilities and equipment",
                "To be the worlds second largest nation, surrounded by 3 oceans and an immense amount of natural resources, spread out over a vast wilderness, that will only become more desirable for hostile nations to try to exploit as the permafrost continues to thaw\u2026 it is absurd that we don\u2019t have a world class navy and Air Force. Ground forces should be adequate for deployment if needed, but we do have america right next door after all, as far as defence is concerned. But our navy and Air Force both need some significant upgrades.",

                "I agree, but I also don't really have too much of a problem with it.\n\nI think we should retain a very limited military. We simply aren't a country that needs international force projection, nor is the world really in a place where thats required anymore.\n\npro-military often cite the idea that \"we just hide behind America\" and I think thats true, I just don't think thats a bad thing.\n\nwe're allies, some of the closest, and most intertwined allies on the entire planet. Allies are good, and they're pointless if you don't rely on them. We don't even share a border with anybody else but them, and they're functionally forced to protect us in order to protect themselves.\n\na military for us is simply of extremely limited use. Its only there so the dude-bro's, the type of guys that salivate over the idea of a burglar breaking into their house so they can shoot someone, to feel like Canada, and therefore themselves, has a big swinging military dick like their beloved 'murica.\n\nand if those guys want to feel big by building a jacked up truck with all the offroad accessories their credit card can buy to build their ineffectual pavement princess that they never actually use, all the power too them. but I don't want them using ***my*** credit card(taxes) just so they can buy a bunch of \"pavement princess\" military hardware that they never use just to feel big.\n\nI'm not saying dissolve the military, nor am I saying we don't need to spend a little money on them sometimes. Just that having a limited and small military, with older equipment, isn't that big of a deal to us in this country.",
                "A strong military has never been in our national interest and our good friends in the US have nixed attempts to improve it that they didn't like (see nuclear subs back in the 80s).\n\nIt was after the US civil war that the British looked south, saw a battle-hardened army and decided that, if the Americans came north, it would be best if they weren't here.\n\nThere were several reasons why Confederation made sense, and this was definitely one of them for the British.\n\nSo, they packed up and left us with a small number of troops.  Our early leaders figured that if the Americans looked north and didn't see a threat, that they would have bigger fish to fry in the southwest and leave us alone.  So, they moved the garrison far from the border.  It worked, when the Americans looked north, they didn't see a threat and focused elsewhere, and we are still an independent country today.\n\nDownplaying the military is in our history and culture right back to the beginning of the country.",
                "Underfunded, corrupt, outdated (\u201cRoyal??\u201d) and embarrassing yes.",
                "When WW2 began most of the weaponry was old and obsolete. But it was in inventory so it was used. In the right hands old weapons can be as deadly as new, but there are few soldiers so well trained. \n\nBeing a thoroughly modern army means tossing out $billions in material. The only way you're ever going to know if your weaponry is adequate is to get into a war where the stuff is tested. For most of the engagements around the world our nation is well-equipped. We can't plan for WW3.",

                "There is always general support for increased resources for the CAF in polling when asked about that issue alone. When asked about whether we should increase taxes, reduce other program spending, or offshore all our military procurement, the tone changes, and tends to split on partisan lines. \n\nWrt to pressure from our allies to increase spending, look at our track record vis-a-vis the 2% of GDP, and what % of total govt spending is tied up in military spending. If you believe that a Gov't should be spending no more than 8% of GDP on all programs, then asking for an investment of 25% of government spending on military would be a struggle for most modern economies. US is the outlier. \n\nYou have to go back to the post-war period to find a period of expansion. De-emphasizing military investment started about the same time we started to increase social spending. A sustainable military needs to be spending approximately 30% of it budget on investments. Canada has rarely hit this target in the past 50 years, and given we like things like health care, old age programs, and $10/ day daycare, won't happen any time soon.",

                "One thing a lot of peeps don't appreciate is how much cavalry would be involved. The cavalry branch still had huge sway irl in the 30's and there's little to point towards this changing.\n\nYou would see armored cars and lots of trucks, but you would have lots of mounted infantry. Tanks would be few and would not be particularly advanced, it's also unlikely any faction would start license producing as every other major would want to keep their designs secret rather than risk them get compromised.",
                "R5: Without involving itself into WW1, the American Military would likely share more of its pre-1917 self than what we see as the American Military of the 40's. If anything, their military in equipment and dress would probably resemble the Chinese Civil War and Warlord period with more lend-leased equipment, and dragoon-style cavalry as mobile infantry.\n\nHell, I'm not even certain that without WW1, the BAR and squad tactics would spring into existence. Imagine an American Army Squad mostly revolving around chauchats, Lewis Guns and leftover Gatlings instead of Garands, Carbines, Greases, Thompsons and BARs.\n\nAlso, I'm guessing domestic factories are unable to produce a whole lot of mechanised gear, on account of the whole war on home soil bit instead of the Arsenal of Democracy.",
                "I agree wholeheartedly, it feels like you've said what I've been screaming in my head the entire time.\n\nARMOURED CARS.",
                "Ngl, Armored Cars and Cavalry is far more intereting that just Normandy but in US.",
                "If I remember correctly the m1 helmet is canon and there is an event about the adoption of it you get as the feds during the civil war. Not sure how realistic the reasoning behins said event is but it\u2019s there.",
                "I think armoured trains would also be slightly more viable than irl too",
                "Fun fact the images on the left are also anachronistic because they portray specifically late war US army while it did go trough a massive evolution during the war. The uniforms and equipment of US army in 1941 were still mostly brodie style helmets and Springfields. But films about this period by far are mostly about the late war period or when set in the early war they use anachronistic uniforms because the later ones are more recognisable and for a long time you could get a lot authentic surplus late war gear for cheap.\n\nBut back to KR when it comes to helmets the advantages of steel helmets were universally recognised already during early stages of WW1. Armies which did not provide such protection were always simply unable to due to financial constrains or lack of domestic manufacturing. Even then if you look at armies with those issues they still would try and get their hands on smaller batches of helmets to at least field them among some units and helmets were highly sought after. USA army even with the issues it had would certainly be more than able to give every soldier a helmet and looking at OTL efforts of Bashford Dean a armour expert who was in charge of US army armour research and procurement (and that also includes body armour not just helmets) I have no doubt it would end up with steel helmets. The most likely candidate is the experimental No. 10 helmet rejected only on the grounds of the large number of M1917 (US Brodies) in storage and a rather dubious claim of its similarity to German helmets (in any case its irrelevant in KR). \n\nAlso not only are the uniforms and equipment based on WW2 if you look at the Generals for each side you will note that they are almost without exception commanders of late-war US campaigns in the pacific and Europe and not Generals of 1936/37. Rather famously almost the whole 36-39 staff was sacked by Marshall and then Marshall sacked much of their replacements and there were still doing widespread personal changes early in the war hence the lack of overlap.\n\nAlso equipment and uniform is hardly the most important part since the civil war itself is also basically a regular multisided war and hardly anything like civil wars of this period and even less similar to what a potential civil war would look like in US which would certainly be a very unique conflict.",
                "and just like the Spanish Civil war, America would be used as a proving ground for all factions to test their weapons out. So M4's and Mustangs wouldn't be there as much as.... every other tank and plane would",
                "People here be like \u201dOmg I wonder what type of SMG the different 2ACW factions would use\u201d, \u201dWhat tanks do you think would be used in the 2ACW, maybe the Pershing or Walker Bulldog develops early?\u201d and also posting fanart of 2ACW soldiers armed with 50-drum BAR\u2019s and 30-round M14\u2019s. \n\nMy brother in Christ, 90% of soldiers would be running around with M1903 Springfields, most tanks would be Renault FT\u2019s or some \u201d\u201d\u201dtanks\u201d\u201d\u201d made with redneck engineering, and the most prominent aircraft would be about what the US Army Air Corps had in the mid-1930\u2019s. Which is a *lot* of obsolete aircraft.",
                "I disagree that America wouldn\u2019t have helmets. 1) because they\u2019d still pay attention to WWI and the evolution of helmet design and 2) Steel helmets are quite cheap for the protection they offer. I appreciate though the the US didn\u2019t have their own helmet OTL until the M1 in the 1940s.\n\nBut I agree that it would be more like Spain (which developed the M26 and the M1934 despite no WWI involvement). There\u2019s also civilian helmets like Firefighting helmets, motorcycle helmets, and perhaps baseball helmets even if only leather, that could advance a new American design.",
                "No helmet feels a little bit too far-fetched IMO. By 1936 pretty much every South American country used one, don't see why US wouldn't adopt one eventually.",
                "Objectively the cooler aesthetic",
                "I agree. It never made much sense for all sides of the American Civil War to be outfitted with OTL WW2 American infantry uniforms, weapons, vehicles, and doctrines outside of few regiments of Macarthur's federals. \n\nThe most fun part of the ACW is people interpreting how each side would look and fight. It's why people love having the PSA take heavily influence from the NCR and Japan since they are the least prepared.",
                "By the 1930s, the United States probably would\u2019ve adopted helmets considering by that point most major militaries were using them to some extent not to mention with the war ending there be a lot of extra equipment that many of the heavily in debt post world war one governments would be more than willing to sell at a bargain price for the United States to study.",

                "How hard would it be to actually implement this ingame?",
                "I agree for early soldiers but as the war would go on they\u2019d likely change to more appropriate gear",
                "It might be closer to the Polish Soviet war than the Spanish civil war tbh",
                "I always saw the the AUS or at least the Minutemen just redyeing those US uniforms on the right a dark blue-grey since yeah that\u2019s what the US had or probably can find plenty leftover to reuse",
                "I see this as an absolute win",
                "The army likely would\u2019ve adopted a helmet as standard kit during the 20s. It\u2019s such a basic element of combat dress and relatively inexpensive. The national guard could\u2019ve picked up British or French surplus gear off the international market. The Entente in OTL sold a TON of captured German equipment on the open market and to minor powers in their spheres. I could easily see Germany doing the same. Either way, the US still has an interest in being looked at as a Great Power that can hold its own and project power overseas, and as such would definitely adopt the helmet and hand grenade as early and relatively inexpensive ways to stay up to par with their peers.",
                "The Naval battles between the US standard battleships would be so cool to see. \n\nThe Sherman and P-40 would probably show up in like the last days of the civil war assuming the war ends 1939-1940.\n\nAt the End the US probably has the most experienced fighting force in the world.",
                "i guess what kind of equipment and tactics each side would have depends on resources, which arms companies side with who and foreign support.\n\nmore populated areas would see conventional warfare, and a lot of guerrilla warfare throughout the country.",
                "TFW you remember the 2ACW was added for game balance and the chance of it happening so improbable  that it\u2019s fine to let people have their fantastical views of what American soldiers would wear.",
                "Isn\u2019t it cannon that M1 helmet was developed after 2ACW due to the urban combat?",
                "Marine would still dress with good old cool hat, Which it's still cool."

In this would be a boat load of classified material that has nothing to do with little green men . We crash a lot of classified experimental projects that most of us have no idea about and they like to keep it that way.

But I don't have a degree on the subject someone willing to come forward with academic prowess would really surprise me if they said he was earnest. \n\nYou can argue that this is a scripted event and that he may have been coached for the interview... But that reduces credibility. \n\nOther footage may help clarify But:\n\nHere he is putting on a show and loving the attention. I'd bet the farm on it.\n\nNow people love to believe, and I can bet the farm on it. \n\nBut the UAP retrieval team is likely for retrieving classified aircraft domestic or foreign where the nature of the aircraft or the airspace intrusion is classified. \n\nLots of reasons for a craft to be classified, it could have experimental sensors, it could be carrying a nuclear payload it could be simply to avoid exposure and embarrassment for unsanctioned black book missions.  It could cause panic, ( Chinese spy balloons certainly did)  it could reveal the nature of our air defenses and potentially expose a vulnerability.\n\nThere are many many reasons to have a crash retrieval team. \n\nFun fact: a crash retrieval team recovered the stealth helicopter that crashed during the Osama bin Laden Raid. \n\nThey had to have... Theres a record of the crash in the after action report but there is not one single photo of the helicopter in any of the media attention that followed only a tail fin. Mysteriously stripped of the stealth composite\nYou don't leave your stealth copter crashed in Pakistan especially when the chinese have a habit of recovering our technology and reverse engineering it. (Theres a satellite photo of a stealth aircraft that was never recovered hanging out back a chinese warehouse in a government complex partially covered by a tarp.)\n\nIf it wasn't for investigative journalism we probably wouldn't know about the stealth Blackhawks that the military has. \n\nNor would we know they have night vision contacts.\n\nTheres plenty of weird stuff that is entirely terrestrial in origin. Not everything top secret is even really a secret but is tangential to a secret and could lead to the discovery of greater secrets. This is why documents get redacted. \n\nThe military industrial complex is rife with corruption and profiteering and those secrets more than anything else is probably why they were denied access. There are things probably much worse than Epstein Island floating around out there and the nice part of OPSec is if you don't need to know: You dont. \n\nAdd to that military contactors that possess their own clearance with questionable oversight and well this is why. We probably have a huge program to save face from idiots who took it too far and are quietly retired. Or disappeared...",

Actually, it seems to me that the entire actual display component could possibly be made as a cylinder (I mean, we have phones that fold now..), with an outer layer as I just described to shutter and act as the slit. So instead of a \"stationary\" image on a moving tablet, a circular display where the image is whipping around 360 degrees. Does THAT make sense? Lol. Would we need insanely high refresh rates for these things, though? Hmm. I think you said 1200 rpm somewhere, so 20 Hz.

Under orders from Tokyo, Sohn Kee-chung had to compete in the Olympics under the Japanese name Son Kitei- and he subsequently won gold for the men's marathon.\n\nSohn in his later years said in an interview: \"I didn't think much about it while I competed in domestic competitions, but the moment I stood on the podium of an international event- the fact that I had no country to call my own enveloped me in sorrow.\" During his stay in Germany, Sohn emphasized his true nationality in interviews and [autographs](https://imgur.com/a/dTOzmYW).\n\nBack in Korea, there was an incident where the newspaper Dong-a Ilbo published a photograph of Sohn at the medal ceremony with the Japanese flag [erased from his shirt](https://imgur.com/a/pkoc2Vu). The act enraged the Japanese Governor-General of Korea Minami Jiro, and the Kempetai military police imprisoned and tortured the reporters and shut down the newspaper. Due to the controversies, Sohn himself returned to Korea under heavy control and surveillence, with no crowds present to celebrate the historic occasion. \n\nSohn Kee-Chung later participated in the first sports event held after Korea's liberation [(pictured holding the flag)](https://imgur.com/a/zO0AX5G), and worked as a coach and helped other notable Korean runners who went on to win in the Boston marathon and the Olympics.\n\nIn a fitting moment of symbolism, he [carried the Olympic torch into the stadium](https://imgur.com/a/eECEbIB) during the 1988 Seoul Olympics held in South Korea.",

He is celebrated for his military genius, administrative skills, and efforts to establish a Hindu kingdom in a time of Mughal dominance. Shivaji employed guerrilla warfare tactics and a strong naval force to challenge the Mughal and other regional powers. He implemented innovative administrative systems, promoted local self-governance, and emphasized the welfare of his subjects.

                "On November 12, 1944, Lt. Friedrich Lengfeld was commanding a beleaguered German rifle company. Like most units on both sides, he had suffered heavy casualties.\n\nEarly that morning, a wounded American could be heard calling from the middle of a German minefield in a no man's land separating the combatants. \"Help me\" the man cried. His unit had withdrawn , however, and no U.S. troops were close enough to hear. Lengfeld ordered his men not to shoot if Americans came to rescue the man. But none came. The soldiers weakening voice was heard for hours.\n\n\"Help me\" he called, again and again. At about 10:30 that morning, Lengfeld could bear the cries no longer. He formed a rescue squad, complete with Red Cross vests and flags, and led his men toward the wounded American. He never made it. Approaching the soldier, he stepped on a land mine, and the exploding metal fragments tore deeply into his body. Eight hours later Lengfeld is dead. The fate of the American is unknown.\n\nMuch of this story, unpublished in any American books on the war, is based on the eyewitness account of Hubert Gees, who served as Lengfeld's communications runner.\n\nSpeaking at the monument's dedication in Germany last October, Gees said : \" Lieutenant Lengfeld was one of the best soldiers of the H\u00fcrtgen Forest. He was an exemplary company commander, who never asked us to do more than he himself was ready to give. He possessed the complete confidence of his soldiers. Ruggles said Lengfeld's sense of duty went far beyond the call. \" You can't go to any greater extreme than to give your life trying to rescue someone you are fighting as your enemy in war \" he said. \" Compare that to the indifference most people feel about each other today.\"\n\nThe bronze and concrete monument is believed to be the only one placed by Americans in a German military cemetery. In both German and English, the plaque reads :\n\nHere in the H\u00fcrtgen Forest, on Nov. 12, 1944, Lt. Friedrich Lengfeld, a German officer, gave his life while trying to save the life of an American soldier lying severely wounded in the 'Wilde Sau' minefield and appealing for medical aid.\"\n\nTo the young Lieutenant, the voice crying out that day did not come from an enemy. Nor from an American, nor a stranger. It came from a human being in need. Something inside Lengfeld compelled him to act - a feeling so strong and enduring not even the madness of war could block it. In the heavy silence of the German forest, where thousands upon thousands met death, that glorious impulse for life is now honored.",

They were experiencing terror at the mere thought of going to the front. A lot of the development of the FND theory occurred at a convalesence hospital for WWI veterans near Edinburgh.\n\nYou can think of FND as corrupted 'software' in otherwise unaffected 'hardware'. Modern treatment involves retraining the brain to avoid strengthening the corrupted neuronal pathways, and instead forming new paths that involve desired behaviour from muscles.\n\nI know all this because I have PTSD induced FND, and have been treated by specialists in the field.",

As in this thread.\n\nWhilst I don\u2019t doubt the strength of feeling of many Eastern Europeans on this subject, I never felt the arguments were that strong and failed to appreciate the counterfactual.\n\nYes, 14 innocent civilians were murdered. But most Soviet leaders would have made that 14 *thousand*. Or even 140 thousand, as Putin is now demonstrating.\n\nGorbachev was a weak leader. He probably only intended a softening of the Communist ideology to improve its appeal, rather than its dismantlement. \n\nBut he was mercifully human enough not to go crazy as many dictators do, especially when they fall. And so he may well be the best of all the Soviet leaders as a man, interestingly because of his faults.",

Eastern europe is only as poor because they are a buffer zone and battleground between the free europe and the remnants of the evil empire in Kremlin. Noone wants to invest in a bufferzone and no economy will thrive if they use a huge amount on military. Only the evil wargamers/elites play that game. So sad. Putin knows this and so the greatest enemy is for communication with the outside world to penetrate Kremlins iron dome.

They do have some assets there, as do the Japanese, but it's owned/leased and operated by the US. \n\nThe French base is just north of Camp Lemonneir and east of the Japanese base. As well as they own a notch that protrudes into the US base(called the French notch).\n\nAnd for anyone wondering, yes, the security there is a nightmare. The US base is in a very strange period. It's currently considered an expeditionary base, which means no family go there, and their are fewer facilities like medical coverage and housing rules. But they are trying to transition the base to a permanent duty station, which would require them to expand on those amenities.",

In Egypt Roman garrisons were closely integrated into civic and religious life and participated in local cults. Around Manfalout, on the banks of the Nile in central Egypt, Roman soldiers were particularly attracted to the crocodile cult centred on the sacred grottoes of the region.\n\nThis imposing armour is made from the skin of a crocodile. It comprises a helmet and cuirass (body armour) and would have been used in military-style ceremonies of the regional crocodile cult. The skin has been radio-carbon dated to the third century AD. It was presented to the British Museum in 1846 by a Mrs Andrews, who was among a group of European travellers to Manfalut who found grottoes containing the mummified remains of humans and animals, including many crocodiles.\n\nAlthough the cold, dry environment of the grotto preserved the suit well, the cuirass in particular was flattened and brittle. It has been painstakingly remoulded by the British Museum's Department of Conservation.\n\nhttps://britishmuseum.withgoogle.com/object/crocodile-skin-suit-of-armour",

The Nazis want to downplay the atrocities and pin them on a small group rather than admit ethnic cleansing was a tentpole of their beliefs and platform.  \n\nBut shit like this makes it hard to believe the quietly exterminated ten million people while nobody knew what they were up to.",

The fortifications were never meant to stop a german invasion, but rather to keep the battlefield out of France. The hope was that the germans would go though the low countries like they did in the previous war, and they did. The French army could cross into Belgium to meet the invaders and dig in along natural defensive lines like rivers. If the germas pushed, the french could fall back, and by the time the germans would reach the french border, they would have expended so much material and manpower that the french could counter attack.  \n\n\nWhere this plan went wrong was with the germans push through the Ardennes. That too could easily have been stopped as the traffic jam that was the german advance was spotted by recon aircraft. The real stupidity laid in the allied high command that dismissed the report.",

He seems to have ignored any proof to help people understand the claim.\n\nFirst, Wiki mentions this:\n\n> According to British historian Niall Ferguson, France is the most successful military power in history. The French participated in 50 of the 125 major European wars that have been fought since 1495; more than any other European state. They are followed by the Austrians who fought in 47 of them, the Spanish in 44 and the English (and later British) who were involved in 43. Out of 169 battles fought since 387BC, they have won 109, lost 49 and drawn 10.[1][2]\n\n[source](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_history_of_France)\n\nThe second citation refers to an article from the Telegraph I can\u2019t access. [article](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/the-filter/qi/8080884/Quite-Interesting-the-QI-cabinet-of-curiosity.html)\n\nBut when searching for other articles or blog posts mentioning something similar, I found this [source](https://www.militaryfactory.com/battles/french_military_victories.php). Here, the list also starts at 387 BC.\n\nThe reason is the Battle of Allia, in which the Gauls defeated the Romans and sacked Rome itself. The Gallic tribe Senones, is mentioned as being the leader of the Gallic war band. The Gauls never united under a single ruler in peacetime - but they were united under the Senones chieftan Brennus, during this military campaign. Only in war were they uniting their forces. \n\nThe Gauls can be seen as founders of the french population, all though some only would go back to Clovis, who united the french tribes and creates the Frankis Kingdom, the foundation of the modern christian country of France. Clovis reigned from 481 to 509 AD.\n\nAll in all: looking at battles between 387 BC and 2014 AD (maybe later, as I am unaware when Niall Ferguson ends his battle-timeline), France has been a dominant power. \n\nThat is also why people in 1870 was surprised when they lost to the Prussian armies. Up until that point, France had been seen as a dominant power on the continent, of course interrupted during the Napoleonic Wars. No one thought it would be possible for them to be defeated, but the Prussians proved everyone wrong. Prior to this, Prussia had already defeated two other neighbors (Denmark in 1864 and Austria in 1866) quite easily. France was no match for Prussia either. This led to a huge shift in the continental powerbase, as the newly Germany became the dominant power from then on, only broken after WWII until 1989. \n\nBut looking at a larger scale, Franc have been dominant and a force to be reckoned with.",

One such device is believed to have fallen through the roof of the house in which Juliana and her owner lived. The dog is reported to have stood over the bomb and urinated on it, extinguishing the fire and preventing it from spreading. She was awarded her first Blue Cross medal for her actions.\n\nJuliana was celebrated as a hero for a second time when, in November 1944, she again helped to save the lives of her owners. After a fire had taken hold in their shoe shop, she alerted her master's family to the impending danger. For this, she was awarded a second medal.\n\nThe second medal, along with a portrait of Juliana, was discovered during a house clearance in Bristol. The items were sold together at a Gloucestershire auction in September 2013, with the auctioneer describing Juliana as \"a Great Dane with a great bladder\". Initially expected to achieve \u00a360, the sale reached \u00a31,100 with the winning bid coming from an anonymous buyer.\n\nUnfortunately, the good girl died due to poisoning via a substance that was posted to her owner's letterbox.",

I\u2019m till this day, it feels like a dream, but the other day, I ask my brother \u201chey do you remember those orbs\u201d instantly, he said yes. This my be hard to believe, but that\u2019s what we saw. Idk what they are or if it was a new ship the gov was working on. So odd and mysterious.

                "[CONTEXT:](http://www.businessinsider.com/the-military-tested-bacterial-weapons-in-san-francisco-2015-7)San Francisco's fog is famous , especially in the summer, when weather conditions combine to create the characteristic cooling blanket that sits over the Bay Area. One fact many may not know about San Francisco's fog is that in 1950, the US military conducted a test to see whether it could be used to help spread a biological weapon in a \"Simulated germ warfare attack.\" This was just the start of many such tests around the country that would go on in secret for years. The test was a success, as Rebecca Kreston explains over at Discover Magazine, and also \"One of the largest human experiments in history.\" But as she writes, it was also \"One of the largest offenses of the Nuremberg Code since its inception.\" The code stipulates that \"Voluntary, informed consent\" is required for research participants, and that experiments that might lead to death or disabling injury are unacceptable.\n\nThe unsuspecting residents of San Francisco certainly could not consent to the military's germ warfare test, and there's good evidence that it could have caused the death of at least one resident of the city, Edward Nevin, and hospitalized 10 others. Nearly all of San Francisco received 500 particle minutes per liter. These tests included the large-scale releases of bacteria in the New York City subway system, on the Pennsylvania Turnpike, and in National Airport just outside Washington, D.C. In a 1994 congressional testimony, Cole said that none of this had been revealed to the public until a 1976 newspaper story revealed the story of a few of the first experiments - though at least a Senate subcommittee had heard testimony about experiments in New York City in 1975, according to a 1995 Newsday report. When Edward Nevin III, the grandson of the Edward Nevin who died in 1950, read about one of those early tests in San Francisco, he connected the story to his grandfather's death from a mysterious bacterial infection. \" The bacteria has shown up in a few other Bay Area health crises since the 1950s, according to the San Francisco Chronicle , leading to some speculation that the original spraying could have established a new microbial population in the area.",

It looked like a dolphin at Sea World and so unnatural for a plane.  When she got even with the grandstand she took it even further and stood the plane straight up and seemed to hover there for a few seconds almost completely motionless and balanced on the exhaust at zero speed before she punched it and launched straight up.

Just last night I had a table of 5 uniformed men, roughly aged 20~ and they not only tried putting their trash on someone else's table but they also spilled 5 sodas on the floor prior to leaving and of course 0 tip. Pretty much sums up the majority. Usually this wouldn't bother myself and coworkers but given that majority of our customers are military men,,, it really hurts not only out wallets but our sanity of having to clean up after these trained men. Also, small note, these men usually demand a military discount and will complain that it's only 10% or that their discount can't be mixed with other coupon deals.\n\nIs this just an issue for my location or is this the same across the board?",

Spending an hour or more with a group of people while you handle their food and drinks and deal with their personality is emotionally taxing. I think it\u2019s even the case for extroverts because, while they enjoy the energy of social interaction, doing it in a compelled sense changes things. Giving someone a haircut for 15+ (sometimes very much so plus) minutes and risking them being upset because your work doesn\u2019t live up to their mental image, is emotionally taxing. Most retail work really isn\u2019t. And if it becomes so due to a large order which requires input and time investment then I think tipping is appropriate there as well (although is up to the customer of course). I really think it comes down to providing a service rather than a good and whether you had to deal with a personality rather than a number and maybe put your personality out there.\n\nI also think delivery drivers deserve a tip due to wear and tear on the car and for the risk involved with being on the road.",

            "selftext": "Like the title says, this is about the last day I served before I put in my 2 weeks notice at the last restaurant I'll ever work at.. after 10 years of serving they finally broke me. \n\nTo set the stage, I was working at this medium nice but weirdly pricey southern cooking restaurant, we had lots of volume and I was making really good money. It was easy and fast paced and I liked my coworkers and had a perfect schedule. Because of all of that I just dealt with the fact that the majority of our guests treated me and tipped me the worst out of any of the multiple restaurant I've worked at (in multiple different cities and over 10 years). Just so, so rude and more condescending than any fine dining restaurant I've been at, which is saying a lot. \n\nI'd been there a little over a year and was starting to get worn down, I cut back my hours a little and that helped but I was tired of being treated like garbage. It finally came to a head one Sunday brunch shift, which is 8am-4/5/6pm (depending) and we do like 350-500 covers. I was cut and had my last 3 tables, a 4 top family, a 2 top couple, and an 8 of celebrating (I think) ladies. \n\nNow, I got the feeling from the vibes that none of them were going to tip me well. When I get this feeling I make a specific point of being as good as I possibly can. I'm already a good server, and am usually the most cheery and friendly person there (if something bad happens my go to is saying well its all uphill from here!), but in this case I was determined to be the best and most friendly and accommodating server no matter how they treated me. I wanted to make sure that any shitty tip I got was not a reflection of my service. So I did that! I was not passive aggressive to their rude comments and I kept a smile (I wasn't like scary and manic about it though, just a regular nice smile) even while they glared and snapped at me. \n\nThe 2 top barely spoke and barely acknowledged me, they stiffed me on a 70 dollar bill.\n\nThe 4 top was a family and it was their first time and they absolutely loved me, the kids even got along with me and they were so thrilled with everything. 10 dollar tip on 120.\n\nThe 8 top was difficult. They didn't like their food (through no fault of ours), they complained about their 8 separate cocktails taking too long, they drank a lot and ignored me and rolled their eyes and it took everything in me to not be so passive aggressive. Their bill was 300 something total (all separate of course) and they combined tipped me so little that the tip out to the bartender was more than I made from them, so it came out of my pocket. I ended up having to pay my own money for the privilege of being treated like a piece of shit. \n\nI was fucking livid. And then I had to clean up their huge fucking mess. I started crying as I was sweeping because I was just so angry and beaten down.\n\nOf course, my manage had sympathy but it was one of those, \"happens to everyone, sorry\" kind of things. She said she couldn't change the tip out. I mean even a server being stiffed on a 15 top was not a rare occurrence there. Corporate insisted that an added gratuity would make us give worse service. \n\nI put in my notice the next day and omg I've never felt such a weight off my shoulders. Now I've signed up for some community college classes and I'm going to work towards getting a degree. \n\nAlso, you know it's bad when all my coworkers said they were so happy and proud of me for leaving. It was like I was escaping prison or something. \n\nWorst things have happened over the years, but the compilation was just too much.

Now the incentive to provide food service doesn\u2019t feel like a performance, it feels like a professional obligation. I still serve to best I can to justify that 20%- but I don\u2019t have to stress about being evaluated by every table. Sort of reverses the power dynamic a little. Also while the money isn\u2019t quite as good, it\u2019s not hit or miss anymore and I can generally expect to have consistent money. \n\n\n\nThere are downsides- management is a real stickler about little details with the whole \u201cif we do auto 20% everything has to be perfect\u201d but overall I understand their point and it\u2019s worth it. \n\n\nI wish the entire industry would start just doing the auto-gratuity (or just raise prices and pay us what we are actually worth).",

We have all been there. \n\nMy worst was my last night as a bartender at a dive bar I hated. It was my last night nothing could touch me. I was in a really good mood having a fun last night with my coworkers. \n\nBar was packed wall to wall, bunch of guys walked in clearly already been drinking and being very passive aggressive from the get go. I decided to take the heat, got a card started a tab. They were just being dickish the whole evening. All of a sudden they were just gone, tried to run the card wouldn\u2019t work\u2026 Massive tab left open. Manger/owner lost her shit at me\u2026 Took it out of my pay. Problem was I was still in my last year of university so I couldn\u2019t afford to take the hit so I had to work an extra shift the next weekend to make up the difference.

In my opinion I thought what the hell did she want a $10 tip  for, all she did was take his order and check on him once, super low maintenance kind of table that doesn't always require a tip.\n\n I can understand when we get upset when a table leaves no tip but honestly sometimes it doesn't even bother me when a table doesn't tip at all.\n\n Example, I had a table of 3 order food and 3 sodas and left no tip. Their food came out good and they only had 1 soda each, no refills but I still did bring them one more refill each without them asking and checked in with them a few times to make sure they were alright and didn't need anything else. Anyways In my head I wasn't bothered at all since they were a super low maintenance type of table that didn't require lots of effort and if they had left me a 20 buck tip it would've been super awesome and I would've gladly accepted it but I was not even mad they didn't tip since they didn't really require lots of maintenance.",

Anyways everytime he closed out he didn't tip, so on his forth drink I asked him if he was gonna tip me and he said \"yea man I'll tip you this time.\" I said \"alright then\"  He said \"sorry I'm broke\" I said \"I am too\" he said \"military doesn't pay much\" I said \"I make $2.13 an hour\" when I hand him his drink I say calmly \"you know, my philosophy is, if you don't have enough money to tip, you don't have money to go to a bar and drink, beside liquor is cheaper at the store anyways\" and I walked away. Honestly I was heated because I was dealing with this one chick who was complaining and running me back and forth, and if I wasn't in a sour mood I wouldn't have said anything. Understand I can quote the verbatim because it's so out of character for me to do something like this I had to go sit outside in 30\u2070 weather just to calm down. idk man I'm upset and I apologized to his friends afterwards cause he left out of embarrassment after I called him out. He made sure to yell at the other bartender and my manager about it though. I feel bad and I feel like I shouldn't had called him out.\n\nEdit: there was other things ticking me off and it was a slow build up to that point. (still doesn't excuse my behavior) The chick running me was just the latest thing to have happened\n\nEdit 2: keep in mind I wasn't gonna cut him off because he wasnt gonna tip, I just wanted him to know what was going on from my perspective\n\nTLDR: I called out a guy for not tipping and feel sorry about embarrassing him",

Ok he\u2019s broke, the least he can do is open a tab and not close out EVERY SINGLE TIME. \n\nNext time just make him wait for drinks, that\u2019s how you deal with a non tipper. Drop some hints, after him waiting five mins for his drink just tell him \u201csorry I took long bud, I was caught up with Bob over there, he\u2019s been tipping fat so I gotta make sure he\u2019s taken care of.

Literally every single person becomes more important to me than that non-tipper closer-outer lol. It\u2019s always \u201csorry! Just a second!\u201d Until they get the message. If they persist and ask why I\u2019m not helping them I just say \u201cwell this guy treats me right\u201d with a wink and they usually get the message. If they still persist then I would say \u201cwell you forgot to tip me twice so far so\u2026\u201d and just let that awkwardness hang in the air while you walk away. \n\nI worked at a high volume bar / venue and if someone didn\u2019t tip me then I was ignoring them for the next 3 customers. One customer could see what was going on and waved a $20 at me and I made his drink first every time I saw him lol. Some people figure it out, the others don\u2019t get their drinks. \n\nWe get paid with tips. People know that.

            "selftext": "Cross posted because i forgot this sub existed and it fits better here. \n\nI just worked 3 shifts at the worst restaurant ever.\n\nRecently i joked around at a restaurant to the owner that i wanted to work there and she said to come in. And i thought wow the boss is cool and it seems like a super chill environment. \n\nWRONG. \n\nThe boss is a micro manager. She is German and blunt. And borderline OCD. \n\nIt\u2019s a relatively new business of about 3 months. And it takes a table 30+ minutes to get their drinks. Why? Well there\u2019s one screen to input orders. And that same screen is used for the bar, the dining, to gos, and checking guests out. So it could take a while before you can even put drinks in. However, we can\u2019t get the drinks ourselves, the two bartenders are in charge of every single drink that goes out, and nobody is allowed behind the bar not even for a water. And they won\u2019t make your drinks till they have been put into the system and have a ticket for them. But then they have 12 tickets at a time. And also have to stop to check people out. \n\nThe kitchen actually has their business in order and they are on their game. But more often than not food comes about before people even get their drinks. And the same thing applies for sauces, a ticket must be made and the kitchen has to receive it before they can give you a little cup thing of ranch or ketchup etc. \n\nThey don\u2019t train you. I am a quick learner i can watch something and have it down. But every time i asked to be taught to do something they\u2019d tell me to figure it out. Mind you this is a restaurant in Germany by a military base, and they knew i only spoke English and Spanish. The entire system is in German. But i digress i did my best despite not being able to read anything. But God forbid i mess anything up they are on my a**. That i messed up and why didn\u2019t i ask for help. And Im like be for real right now. \n\nThere are items on the menu that aren\u2019t available like ever. And on sundays even less. Today , no sanwiches, no burgers, no pizza, no sweet tea, low on tenders, wings, and rice and MORE. No biggie except for telling customers like basically they can order five things off of the entire menu. The part that gets me though, is nobody tells you and expects you to run to the kitchen for every single dish and ask if they are making it. \n\nSometimes they\u2019ll say \u201cwe\u2019re out of wings\u201d and Im like okay cool so i start telling guests we don\u2019t have wings. Then the boss pulls me aside to tell me well we didn\u2019t have any for an hour but we do now and Im like okay nobody told me that. A couple ordered a taco pizza , nobody told me we weren\u2019t making pizzas today or that this specific pizza isn\u2019t technically an item anymore because the owner won\u2019t make the sauce. So they got after me about it, and i was dreading going back to tell this table for the upteenth time that what they want is not available yet again. Well they left a one star review and everyone was only my budonkadonk about it. \n\nAnd this isn\u2019t even the half of it in the three underpaid shifts i worked. A job i only took because i was like it should be fun and something to do. No it\u2019s hell. I fought for my life all weekend for less pay than it\u2019s worth. I am drained. More than I\u2019ve ever been mind you I\u2019ve worked on a tractor 16 hrs a day 21 days in a row before. I got home all three days crying. I\u2019ve been a server and barista before and loved them both and this was like my own personal customer service / food service hell, even without being s**harassed by a guest. \n\nAnyways tomorrow morning Im texting the manager that i will not be going in for the two shifts Im scheduled for this paycheck and that at this point i don\u2019t even want to go pick up my paycheck Im so traumatized.",

                "I have never had a discounted table tip me based on the real cost of their goods and services. Ever. \n\nWhich is bad. If the restaurant decides to discount?  Cool. Your server still did the same amount of work even if you didn\u2019t get 20% off due to a coupon or a conciliatory discount. How would THEY feel if their hourly wage changed when you used a coupon, say, at a gas station where they\u2019re the cashier?  Umm... they\u2019d throw a shit-fit!  Nobody\u2019s boss says \u201coh they used a coupon/discount so you get $3/hr and not minimum wage of $7.25\u201d. Nobody would be ok with that. \n\nBefore I was ever a server, I knew to tip based on the original (non-coupon or discounted) bill. But most don\u2019t.  Anytime I was in doubt about situations to tip, I\u2019d google. #RevolutionaryConceptApparently. The fact I did this before I  was a server means nobody has an excuse. \n\nI\u2019ve worked my booty off and literally bloodied my toes for tables who tipped me based on massively discounted meals. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f multiple, multiple times. There\u2019s no excuse for this ignorance. I\u2019m sorry you had to deal with it, OP. \n\nWorst yet, it\u2019s most often the \u201cdifficult/mad about everything\u201d tables that get discounted by scared managers, and they tip 10% on a 30% discounted bill PLUS comped desserts etc., and ask you to take a pic of them afterwards (this happened to me) AND run you to pieces for every condiment and complaint (\u201cits too salty\u201d \u201cit\u2019s not like I remember it\u201d \u201cdid you change the recipe?!\u201d \u201cUm it was JUST OKAY \ud83d\ude44\u201d as though I cooked all this shit.). One time I even had a lady accuse me of leaving her food in the kitchen, when I actually babysat the fryer and brought it the very second it was done!  I told her \u201clove, if I could cook it for you myself I would, but I can\u2019t. I promise I brought it to you as soon as it was done. In fact, watch out because it willlll be very hot. It\u2019s just now fresh out of the fryer. I stood by as they took it out with your plates in my hands\u201d\n\nAND they take forever to order - the kind who say \u201coh we\u2019re ready to order\u201d Impatiently, then proceed to NOT know they have the option of a side with their burger (LOL), and ask what are their options, or to ask about 3 Dishes and order the ONE DISH they didn\u2019t ask about \nNot to mention ones who say \u201cI\u2019ll have the burger\u201d when we have THREE DIFFERENT BURGERS YO!!!  Which one?!\n\nTo:dr: \nPeople suck.  If they ask for a discount, it\u2019s an even higher likelihood they will be extra, extra sucky.  It\u2019s not a bad idea to put your most valuable energy elsewhere   Yes take good care of them. But these are not the ones to go above and beyond for; they will never appreciate it.

It\u2019s $16.11/hr and they make about $60-90 in tips a day (which are cashed out - not sure if that\u2019s relevant info) and they have a lot of online orders along with the sit down orders. Everyone shares roles like busser, host, and server, and that there aren\u2019t designated sections. She said she had a good feeling about me and that she really wanted to hire me.\n\nThe kbbq manager said that the job would also be really hard, as it\u2019s the kind of place where you cook the food for the customers, and because customers are dropping $150-500 on a single meal they can be very picky about it. Pay is also $16.11/hr plus tips (I think she said it\u2019s about $25/hr? I\u2019ll text her and double check) and they\u2019re booked as hell during the weekend. The manager seemed pretty chill, straightforward and said that she was in the military for years so she might come off aggressive, but means well. She also said that she had a few more people to interview and that it was up to me if I wanted to accept the job. \n\nSorry if I left out some information or included irrelevant stuff, as you can see I\u2019m really inexperienced. I\u2019m not really sure what to do, both jobs seem like they\u2019ll be really hectic but the noodle shop manager seemed like a mentor figure that I wouldn\u2019t mind for my first restaurant job, while the kbbq looks like it\u2019ll make better money. I\u2019m the type of person who works best when I\u2019m in a team with people I get along with, so I\u2019m factoring in the noodle manager\u2019s attitude quite a bit.

We rode it out for at least 3 months after the state-wide mask mandate expired. After excessive questions, borderline harassment, we decided to ditch required masks.

(About 70% of our 75 employees are vaccinated.)\n\nSome cooks and servers still wear them, but like I said, it's not required.\n\nToday, we got news that one of our \"veterans\" (long-time server) tested positive. She had been around all of us the night before, maskless. (She was anti-vax, but not apparently/annoyingly so.) Immediately, we all masked up, as we do not want to spread it to our guests. This would be our third case in a  couple weeks among employees.\n\nStill not \"required,\" only 3 employees chose not to wear masks. All of those are anti-vax (ie, the ones who \\*should\\* be wearing masks).\n\nSeeing this, our (amazing) management team sent out an alert via our scheduling app that any employee that could show proof of vaccination would be handed two crisp $100 bills. It basically just ended in all of our (already) vaccinated employees lining up for money...\n\nTalked to one of my coworkers (mid-20s server, also a military vet), he very smugly told me that  he didn't need the $200 because he's healthy, he works out and takes care of himself. I quote, \"Everyone in the hospital with COVID are obese and have ruined their immune system\" through poor lifestyle choices. When he said, \"I'm not anti-vax, I just don't see a reason why I should \\*personally\\* get the vaccine,\" I said, \"It's not really for you, it's for everyone else.\" He looked at me like I was a complete alien. That man has no empathy at all.\n\nAnother employee said (in response to the announcement), \"Okay, great. I get $200, but then my kids grow up without a mother.\"  (Obviously implying that the vaccine would literally KILL her.)\n\nI'm glad that $200 richer, but it's literally plunged our anti-vax employees further into belief of a crazy conspiracy theory.

I forgot it was veteran's day until I got to work. we were bombarded with people before we even opened. I ran around like a chicken without a head and got shitty tips and dirty looks because they had to pay for their sodas. a guy yelled at me for not getting his blue cheese fast enough, as if I was just walking around the restaurant vibing and doing nothing. another guy yelled at me and complained to my manager about me because I was off the clock and resetting the drawer for the nighttime bartender and couldn't cash him out.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------\n\nI was opening bartender. \n\nNot only were we doing a veteran\u2019s day promo, it was our normal BOGO boneless wings promo. complete chaos. \n\nDONT GET ME WRONG, I SUPPORT OUR TROOPS OF THE GOOD OL' U.S.A. my lil brother is an active marine and a handful of my family is military... BUT I already knew this day was goin' to be a complete shit show.\n\nFIRST OFF, I had to get my caffeine fix of an iced macchiato. the barista didn't hear me say \"iced\" even though I said it twice: when ordering and again when I paid because I wasn't sure if she heard me the first time. she said okay and gave me my total. still made me a hot coffee.   \nthought to myself, \"no biggie, they're busy, I'll just go to the Starbucks by my job 'cause I'm boutta be late.\" get to the other location and walk inside and asked for a venti cup with just ice and a lid... gave me a grande. \\[insert intense eyerolll here\\] basically said fuck it whatever I have a cup of ice, goal complete.\n\nget to work and my manager unlocks the door for me and the hostess. it's 10:45a and not even a full minute after the door shuts and locked again there's a HOARD of people trying to get in. and I mean SHAKING the door like \"wHy'S iT LoCkEd? iT wOnT OpEn\" type shit. WE DON'T OPEN UNTIL 11a, people! like c'mon I haven't even cut any fruit yet.\n\n10:53a - there's a flood of people at the door, and I'm talking Noahs ark type flood.   \nmanager lets them in.   \nlet the chaos begin, at minimum 25 people for takeout. I'm quadruple sat. luckily only 1's and 2's. \n\n11a - another server comes in. not a strong server. we're rotating the whole restaurant and she can't keep up. no biggie, just gotta remind her of her tables. \n\n11:30a - too many people standing at the door so people just start walking to the high tops and rail.  \ngreat. I'm bombarded with people and I can't find this server to help me. just take all the tables. \n\n12p - THANK GOD. another server.... fuck. another one who isn't strong. well, it's another body.   \nI let them team up dining side so I can handle bar side and service bar. this is fine. it'll be fine.\n\nI've manage to get at most $5 tips, dirty looks because their sodas didn't come with the meal, the most understanding people to give me $1 tip, pretty sure I was only stiffed twice, and some guy yelled at me because I didn't get his blue cheese fast enough as he saw me running around with a full rail and at least 8 tables on the floor. \n\napprox 1:30p we're now on a hour and a half wait because our takeout screen is 20+ pages deep and dine-in was about the same.  \nduring that wait, as people came to try to sit and I inform them about the food wait, I get the nastiest attitudes as if it's my fault. \n\n3p-5p - last two hours of my shift. not slow. but steady. finally. now I can clean and restock for my closing bartender.\n\naround 6p - my last guest cashed out and they take my drawer. everyone's up my GM's ass as he's resetting the drawer to bring back out so he doesn't finish counting the dimes, nickels, and pennies. I take the drawer back to the bar.   \na bar guest asks me to cash him out. I inform him that **I'm unable to do that since I'm off the clock and I'm only here to reset the drawer for my nighttime bartender, however when she comes back from checking on her tables she can close him out.**\n\nhe watches me count these fucking coins and interrupts me asking if he can cash out anywhere else and I shake my head \"no\" and say he needs to close out with his server. he's angry. I finish the drawer and run around lookin for my bartender but I ran into my GM and have him print his check. I drop it off and he wants to speak to a manager. my assistant GM just walked outta the beer cooler and I send him over. This man complained about me because I *\"shouldn't ignore a customer to count money.*\" THE AUDACITY. he said it nice and loud and clear for me AND everyone to hear. I swear I bit part of my tongue off.\n\nI stayed at least another hour and a half OFF the clock to help my bartender with service bar because the hostess decided to sit every table in the bar at once. \n\nI hated today. I would've rather worked a severely understaffed UFC fight night then deal with the amount of unnecessary attitudes I received for 7-8hrs.",

It is our policy to keep a card on file which took some bickering amongst the group, but I get one on file with no issues. I introduce myself they are all firing from all fronts on what they all want. I put my foot down and said I'll take their drink orders first before taking any orders. At this point I want to take their orders with fast service, and get them out.\n\nThe worst of the bunch got in my face because I wouldn't enter her entree order when I was taking the group's drink order when none of them were ready to order food. Then and I also got a, \"Ya'll got Mountain Dew or Mello Yello?\" It was funny because his friends were yelling, \"He said coke products, and no Northeastern restaurants have either drinks!\" I found this funny, I wont forget this and I will search the land for Mello Yello.\n\nI have pride in what I do and I can handle most. This group was mostly obnoxious, entitled, and arrogant. It's not an easy 12 top but I take control and get everything in and delivered. Their orders are done and I try to connect with the group. Some of them were nice, but the rest were awful . They mostly end up doing TikTok dance recordings.\n\nNow the person who had a card on file was the older one, and I'm guessing a higher ranking person (they are from a military community college). She agreed to having her card on file but then said, \"I'll pay a portion but divide the rest 11 ways.\"\n\nWhile this was happening, my private party was sat at their table and I cannot hang around. I said, \"I can do an even split with the cards.\" They all refuse and I remind them that this was mentioned in the beginning and they said, \"The last server....\"\n\n\"NO! We're not doing that because it's a waste of my time, I'll get my manager to settle this!\"\n\nIt was crazy because my manager had create individual checks for everyone and they all lined up and continued TikTok dancing around other guests.

                "Hell No! I don't f with this behavior. 15 yrs ago when I was first trained as a server,  I was taught to always keep control of the table, and not let the table control you. I use seat numbers, so if you want separate checks, sit down in your seat and don't move, if you all start switching seats, sorry I can't split checks; I make that clear from the jump. If someone wants to order anything other than drinks when I am there to get a DRINK order, I politely say, \"Yes I can help you with that, but can I get you something to drink first?\"\n\nThere are always polite ways to kill people with kindness and still maintain order. I verbalize in my sweetest server voice, \"OK, what I'm going to do is get this young lady's order and go counter-clockwise around the table ok everyone?\" If guests continue to be rowdy and move around and disturb my points of service, I will get stern, and say \"I'm sorry, at this point there will be no way I will be able to separate checks unless your party settles down.\" \n\nAt the first instance I notice disruptive behavior, I go straight to my MOD, and explain the situation, and let him/her know how I plan to handle the table. I also update MOD on continuing disruptions, so that if I am unable to control the table, at least the manager already is versed on what is going on, and my ass is covered. \n\nAs a professional,  I feel it is best to consult management only when there is nothing else I can do to better the situation. Management will appreciate this, as there is much more on their plate, than you may realize, and figuring out your check is just one more thing to add to their list.\n\nBe confident, sweet, accommodating within reason, and assertive, no matter how obnoxious and inconsiderate the clowns you are serving behave.",

They ran my butt off, every time I hit the table I\u2019d have to tote off a tray of dirty dishes from apps desserts. All my coworkers were mad at ME for everything I did. I took 12 loaves of bread for the table (when they were coming in I put 25 loaves in the oven) and then when the bar got drinks from my table (8 at most for the whole table) at first they did okay but then it took an hour to get one martini. As I was ringing food for this huge party the salads were coming out while I was still typing in the other half of the party so people were mad my salads were in the window and only one person helped me run them. When food started going out i went back to get another tray and my window manager yelled at me for asking for a garlic butter (she forgot to plate it) and then said I couldn\u2019t take it with the tray that was going to the same table. She would snap at me for every little thing I asked for. A potato that didn\u2019t go out with the check was like the end of the world. She was telling me I wasn\u2019t ringing things in when I most definitely had. I would ring in 4 plates at a time so it was only one tray of food on each ticket because I know they sometimes mess up more on long tickets. She was just so unnecessarily mean. And my front of house also, set the booth up with 24 seats when the reservation was 30 and when I asked for help finding extra seats because the restaurant was kinda busy she just ignored me and when I needed a manager swipe for military discount on 2 checks she would go to do it and then take another server instead and tell me to wait when I\u2019d already been waiting about seven minutes for 2 swipes. Neither manager spoke to me for the rest of the night. I only got 2 tables after they left and all my coworkers were talking shit about me and my family every time I turned around. It was a rough night. But my family had a fantastic meal, no cook-ups or anything. I rang every plate in one temp under so it had time in the window to not over cook like it normally does with parties. And drinks were never empty unless the bar ignored them. And then the managers didn\u2019t even ask if the meal was good. It\u2019s the slowest month of the year where I work and at the end of the day it was a $800 dollar check. I thought they\u2019d be a bit nicer because one of the managers was the literal store owner. Do you think it was called for how everyone was being toward me? \n\nTl;dr.... my 30 person family came in and weren\u2019t overly demanding of anyone aside from me. The employees were yelling at me and the managers were being very mean because I was related to the large part that cause us to go into a wait (which happens every week). Or make me wait for things I needed  because the table wasn\u2019t \u201ca priority\u201d for them. Just overall verryyyy mean. Was it called for?",

I finally picked all my parts, ready to buy each part or two every month. I was literally planning on buying the hard drive this morning but then my Mac was broken down.\n\nI planned to go to DC on spring break for 3-4 days cuz I wanna move to DC metro area for my future career so the whole trip should be less than or about 500 bucks (I always bring more in case of emergency).\n\n\nSo I really need the money to do all these things.

The rest just paid me exact the 15% pther than one family paid me extra.

FRIDAY NIGHT, 28 bucks.\n\nThursday another cheap ass family 4 top paid me $10 out of their $12x but another table paid me well so that day was fine, $4x total that night.\n\nThe Saturday after Valentine's day a 2 top didn't even pay me a penny out of their $7x, the cheap mofo is a military so I even gave him a 10% off.\n\nAlone with cheap asses kept paying me 5-8 bucks when their 15% are 10 bucks I have been getting way less tips then usual compare to other days, WHEN I NEEDED MONEY THE MOST FOR THIS MONTH.\n\nAll of them enjoyed their food, nothing wrong with their visit, but they are just cheap as fuck and don't deserve anyone to serve them. Here's my opinion, if I'm broke and I know I can't afford tips I'd just stay home and cook or get takeout.",

Just the other day I got $100 on $100 check and have had too much fortune to even call it that. $500-2000 extra tips thanks to changing my perspective. You lose some. But more often than not if you follow through and just stop giving so much of a fuck about the bottom dollar or prejudging others you'll make A LOT more money. I was in your position two nights back.

I'm completely functional in other aspects of life, however, I am seriously insecure about my stage presence in a restaurant setting. It's strange and difficult to describe.\n\nIn all honesty I've been an okay server for most people, and an excellent server for some, and a flat out bad server for one or two tables so far while working at this  Japanese restaurant. The other day, however, I had a massive failure that wrecked me. \n\nIt was a slow Thursday night and I had taken care of three tables. They were all smiles and loved the experience. Next, this family of 8 comes in with a birthday reservation. I'm not sure what I did right off the bat but the family was very quiet towards me. I warmed them up a bit after bringing out their appetizers but I lost them again after some of their food took awhile to come out. Towards the end of the meal, one man asked me for a bento box to go and I read it back to him to make sure it was what he wanted. I brought it out at the end of the meal and he said he wanted two bento boxes each with something he never mentioned. I apologized but he was visibly upset. As a result, I told him exactly what our bento boxes came with. He agreed, and I even got our restaurant owner involved. We brought it out and he complained again while coming in to say that it was one of his worst experiences at a restaurant ever. He tipped $0 on a $200 bill.\n\nFor the rest of that night, I felt completely incompetent. I felt crazy. It felt as if I wasn't in touch with reality because the line of communication was so shattered with that man. I've been through a lot of difficult life experiences, including the military, but I've concluded that some days I absolutely hate serving people.\n\nFor the time being, I will keep working here because most days are good and the tips are great. However, my confidence as a server is definitely shaken a bit. I would definitely appreciate all your tips for handling big parties or just keeping your head up.",

Because when you're told that either you can go to prison OR join the military, presumably getting the benefits a soldier does such as a bit of freedom/etc, the choice is pretty clear.\n\n2). There WILL be military recruiters who make these prisoners feel like they DON'T have a choice. Either they'll really play up how bad prison is, make subtle threats, etc, etc, or else they'll simply tell them they don't have a choice. No matter what, you'll have people who see an opportunity for soldiers who CANNOT defect from the military and they'll jump all over it.\n\n3). Similarily, you'll likely see an increase in non-violent criminal cases. Not because there's an increase in crime but because the criminal justice system will increase how many are persecuted and sentenced. It's the same thing that happened, after all, when prisons started to be privatized and ran for a profit.\n\n(4. Not everyone convicted of a non-violent crime will **actually** be guilty. If you pressure those people to go into the military and then they DIE, while deployed, before its found out they're innocent thats one hell of a bad look AND a lawsuit.\n\n(5.

However the coastal waters are not very deep and until they reach the pacific ocean proper, submarines (on both sides) can sometimes be spotted from the air/space when close to the mainland. \n\nAlso, China is experimenting with smaller drone submarines which can help with spotting and tracking US forces.\n\nFinally there are the large missiles which can reach targets in the US. However these missiles can (but don't have to) carry nuclear warheads. Because it is impossible to verify the payload of an enemy missile, it's unlikely these will be used in a war. The risk for nuclear war is just too large.",

We set up positions about 25 meters apart, which in a dark icy forest is a considerable distance.\n\nSat there for a couple hours, in a hole by myself, before I started hearing noises like low howling, heard the occasional footstep, etc. I started getting the feeling that SOMETHING was out there, watching me.

                "One morning when we were all woken up, everyone is jumping out of their beds getting ready when we notice that one guy's bed is empty. Someone asks where he is, then someone shouts if anyone has seen him. A second later dude's wall locker opens, and he gets out of it. He had been in there all night, and we're all looking at each other like, this dude has a screw loose. The same guy also got chewed out by the laundry crew because he kept shitting his pants and they had to wash all his underwear. He didn't make it to graduation. \n\nAnother story is about me! This was early in boot camp, maybe third week, and during chow you had to sit down and get up in a cascade motion. Like table one sits and eats, then table two, table three, etc. And you couldn't sit out of order, so table two couldn't sit before table one. Then when you were done, table one got up first, then table two, etc. And you couldn't sit down or get up out of order, so if the table that sat down after you was done, they had to get up and leave or get yelled at, and you had to shove everything in your mouth and get up before them so you wouldn't get yelled at. We also only had like three minutes to eat.\n\nOne day we're eating breakfast, and I used to put everything I got between two pieces of french toast, I scarf it down as fast as I can, and my table gets up. I'm a little hazy on how this happened, but I ended up marching back to the dorm alone, and usually you march with at least one other person. To get back to my dorm, I had to pass by other flight's dorms. Their doorways were to my right, and their patios were to my left. The patio was basically an asphalt pad where you formed up in the morning and some people had to maintain that area and keep it clean. \n\nI'm marching past another dorm, and I have one big hiccup, it's like a hiccup and a gasp combined. It's happened before when I eat too fast so nothing out of the ordinary. But this time was different. I do the normal hiccup/gasp, and then immediately projectile vomited all over some other flight's patio. I can see chewed up scrambled eggs and french toast. I panic. I turn around and no one is behind me. I look around and no one is near me. I made a split-second decision and power walked to the end of the building, turned the corner, and ran back to my dorm. I spent the whole day riddled with anxiety waiting to get in trouble, but no one ever brought it up or asked about it. I think about it every time I have a single hiccup, and wonder who found it and if someone else got in trouble for it.",
                "I fractured a bone in my foot three days before graduation. There was no way in hell I was going to go to medical and risk not graduating with my platoon. I told my squad leader, who talked to two other guys who were at strategic spots around me in formation. We were able to effectively block me from the drill instructors' view for a couple days so that they didn't notice any missteps.",

Anyway, the drill sergeant saw this and tore the poor guy a new asshole for not having the good sense to fall out and go to the latrine. I was actually more impressed at his steadfast military bearing than anything.\n\nThe one that made me inwardly chuckle was another time when the sergeant was chewing on some poor fellow and told him he needed to get his ass over to the PX and buy a box of common sense."

                "Does not matter if Wagner Group played both sides because the psychological blow is serious and it\u2019ll only give rise to future rebellions. Plus if this is true then Wagner group leadership would be a real fool to not milk the cash  cow called USA twice a day for next few years like few other groups and countries did. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s totally true that Wagner group switched its position after a payment. I however also assume that a mix of western intelligence agencies must have played a crucial role and some form of financial transactions also to exploit this vulnerability. \ud83d\udc4d",

                "That's a specific narrative for a specific group of people who want to believe that",
                "Nah, internal Russian politics is absolutely fucked up and incompetent enough for the Wagner rebellion actually jokes we were paid off, bye! to happen organically. This is why having the mafia be your government and your saviors being a junta is ill-advisable.",
                "It's more likely that Putin had his people \"convince\" Prigozhin's family to talk him out of continuing towards Moscow.",
                "Not plausible at all. This is not compatible with who Wagner are, what the West is trying to achieve in Ukraine and Russia, and what we know (so far) about what happened on the day.\n\nFirst, Wagner are a Private Military Company (PMC) owned by Russian billionaire Yegveny Prigozhin. As PMCs are technically illegal under Russian law, it is not possible for a PMC to exist without the tacit approval of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Furthermore, it is not possible to be a Russian billionaire without approval from Putin. Since around 2004, Putin confiscated the wealth and assets of many Russian oligarchs, and created new oligarchs out of people he knew personally. Putin and Prigozhin have known each other since Putin was Deputy Mayor of St Petersburg.\n\nWagner started under the radar in around 2014, and their first major operations were the annexation of Crimea and the Donbas region. Combined with Russia-aligned separatists and Russian forces without insignia, Wagner were used to give the Kremlin plausible deniability until the annexations were completed. In late 2015 Wagner forces appeared in Syria, again assisting Russian forces who were supporting Bashar al-Assad's regime.\n\nWagner operated with Putin's approval, and were used to achieve Putin's objectives. Their status as a PMC attracts higher quality soldiers, provides deniability, and makes them absolutely disposable if the need arises. They were the force used for jobs that were too dangerous or too dirty for the Ministry of Defence (MOD).\n\nSecond, destabilising Russia with a military or mercenary coup does not work in the medium- or long-term interests of the US and NATO. Even if it ended the war in Ukraine, which is not remotely guaranteed, it creates serious issues regarding direct Russia-NATO conflict. If Russia deteriorates then many other issues emerge such as mass displacement, economic collapse, and potential nuclear proliferation.\n\nAs far as the US and NATO is concerned, the best path forward in Russia is for the Russian people to choose a leader who would rather end the sanctions than continue the war in Ukraine. Even in desperate circumstances, I believe that NATO is more likely to intervene directly in the war than take a gamble on a mercenary coup.\n\nThird, if Prigozhin had taken money from the US or NATO and then betrayed them, then the coup would have been staged to make it far less embarrassing for him and for Putin.  Putin managed to simultaneously overreact (by creating panic in Moscow and possibly fleeing the city) and underreact (by not inflicting a decisive military defeat on Wagner forces).\n\nWe believe that six helicopters and one warplane were shot down by Wagner during the coup, resulting in the deaths of at least 13 Russian airmen. There were (still unconfirmed) reports of direct clashes on the ground, and we know that Russia tried to bomb the Wagner columns en route to Moscow. The coup attempt was a significant propaganda victory for Ukraine, and a non-insignificant loss of materiel for the Russian MOD.\n\nThe more that is revealed about the coup attempt, the more it looks like a conditional surrender from Prigozhin. Prigozhin is some combination of hostage, guest and prisoner in Belarus. Wagner personnel willing to join the MOD will do so, and all Wagner heavy equipment is being transferred to the MOD. Wagnerites unwilling to join the MOD might be allowed to operate at arm's length in Syria and Africa, but could equally be thrown in prison. Either way, this looks like the end of Wagner in Russian and Ukraine."

Nice professional \"9-5\", or \"6am-4pm\" M-F type office work environment to serve time in as an older dude... Branch offices maybe had a dozen people in them as split in between some veterinary technicians, and the food inspection staff. \n\nThat last 10% really just involve the last command i was in where instead of letting people do their jobs, and be drama free critical people in authority were all about the drama, and did not care about the work needing to be done. Shit in that one ultimately led to what forced my medical retirement out of service. \n\nBasic  training is what it is, but its also not all that bad as long as one knows, and understands what its all about. Their job is to not only try to break down to build up but to screen truly unstable people out before they get to some duty site to cause problems, or a deployment, and get others killed. Past that was basically a few months worth of exercise camp where people screamed at the newbies. If prepared for it its fine, but if some clueless immature kid that should never have enlisted anyways then it can seem pretty horrible. \n\nDuty wise, it all depends on ones commands really. Some commands are great, and others are not... and also depend son the job you get, or pick over all. Some occupational specialties have huge problems with command toxicity regardless of where one goes. My late brother was super unlucky with his commands on the supply side of the equation. They were all pure trash, and what he went through made his alcoholism get categorically worse than what it was before... to a point that he died from complications related to it just after he separated.(they did shit like weeks on end of 16-18 hour days... in garrison in the US... topped off with super toxic commands cultures)\n\nNow, this being said.. you ask some 11B, or other true \"Grunts\" about the shit they do, and have had to deal with the stories will be completely different in nature.",

There were times when I got extremely homesick but my friends and shipmates always helped me through.  \n\nI didn\u2019t re-enlist because I was very much in love with my girlfriend and want to build a life with her.",

I see both sides many experts estimate that more people would have been killed if the war would have waged on and Truman rightfully so as president of his country would have been more concerned with his people. Also both sides were facing bombings on civilian populations, for example Britain was repeatedly shelled to almost nothing in civilian cities.

                "Thing is....anyone who stayed in past basic is going to have so many that they're hard to rank. So I will give you a funny one or two.\n\nWhen I was a student in pilot training, I got to fly with a really funny instructor who'd been a special operations pilot before that. He was taking me up for my solo - we were going to fly 3 patterns and landings, then he was going to hop out and send me up alone. We're taxiing out to the runway, canopy is sealed. I had Buffalo Wild Wings the night before - jammin' jalape\u00f1o - and between that and the nerves, my stomach was in knots. I ripped a horrendous fart in the front cockpit, the sound of which was drowned out by the engine, but I could feel in my asshole that it must have been loud. About 3 seconds later I hear the instructor start gagging, and he gasp-yelled \"Jesus fucking Christ dude, my mask was down! Are you proud of yourself right now?! Is this where you want to be when Jesus comes back?!\" That cracked me up pretty good. \n\nTen years later I'd finished my first operational tour and came back to be a flight commander at the same base, same squadron, same flight. I'd come \"home\" in a way. I was grading my students' tests, and one made a mistake. As a joke, I stood up and yelled \"WHERE THE FUCK IS [that dude]?!\" The terrified students nervously told me he was at the gym. I screamed, \"WELL HE FUCKED EVEYTHING UP, TELL HIM I WANT HIS MUSTACHE ON MY DESK!\" and I hurled the stack of papers into the air and stormed out. Three months after that, he came into my office after his first solo,  and said \"Sir, I have a gift for you,\" and pulled his covid mask down. It took me a second to realize he no longer had his mustache, which had been epic. As my eyes widened in realization and horror, he reached into a brown paper bag, and pulled out his mustache, which he'd trimmed, neatly arranged and sandwiched between two panes of glass, and framed for me. It's the grossest thing I\u2019ve ever been given. It is also the funniest thing I've ever been given.",

Not sure if you want to go 4 years without sex, but he did.\n\nNot least of which, being deployed is a marriage killer for those who do find partners. Months apart isn't what most people think of wedded bliss. And if you find another enlisted member to love? Congrats! You will be years or even decades before you are posted to the same location. One woman I met had been posted to different locations than her husband for the first 12 YEARS of their marriage. Good on them for hacking that, but most people wouldn't. \n\nAnd if that wasn't bad enough, VERY FEW educated professional women want military men. I will never move to some backwater with few employment prospects to follow a partner. I have my own career goals that are important to me. I have a zero tolerance policy against dating anyone involved in the military for this reason.\n\nMy friend who is looking to leave also makes TERRIBLE MONEY.

One individual from my first assignment is now a four-star and a service chief (i.e., the top individual in that branch of service).\n\nAnother aspect I appreciated was the training and constant focus on mission success, attention to detail, and situational awareness. All good \u201csoft\u201d skills that I took with me when I left.\n\nThe education benefits were also first rate. In my specialty, a master\u2019s degree was totally free for the taking. All you had to do was sign up at the school/program of your choice (although you usually had to do it by correspondence because you were doing it on your own time) and have the university bill the government. In fact, if you were in that particular specialty and not pursuing a graduate degree, you were not viewed in a positive light by the command and you jeopardized your promotability.

                "Im not military but I was diagnosed with PTSD almost two years ago now. My diagnosis came 9 years after the initial trauma (major car accident). We did a lot of research on different treatments to find what we thought would work best for me.\n\nI decided to do EMDR therapy. EMDR stands for eye movement desensitization and reprocessing. This worked extremely well for me, but every person and every trauma are different. In EMDR you will talk through with your therapist about your trauma and figure out what is most bothersome to you in the moment. That is your target. You then will come up with a current \u201cbelief\u201d about that target and then come up with an \u201cadaptive belief\u201d, or what you want to believe about the situation. For example, my main belief I worked with the most was \u201cI feel unsafe and need to be alert in the car\u201d and my adaptive belief was \u201cI can feel safe and comfortable in the car\u201d. The next part of EMDR can differ. My therapist either tapped back and forth on your knees, or you could hold \u201ctappers\u201d in your hands. They connect to a device with a wire, and you can adjust how fast it taps and even the \u201cintensity\u201d of the taps. Your therapist then asks you to think about something related to your trauma, and after short intervals of time your therapist will stop and ask you to rate your discomfort and maybe some other questions, then they will guide you through more short intervals like this. It probably differs from therapist to therapist, but thats how my therapist did it with me. \n\nSome other things you can do to help with PTSD include:\n- Cognitive therapy, pretty much where you talk through your trauma with a therapist. This did not work very well for me personally, but I would also just shut down at the mention of a car in general. I did this almost directly after my first accident when I was very young. \n\n- Exposure Therapy. I never did this in a professional setting, but my parents did do something very similar to get me to go into a car again. It worked pretty well for me, but never really targeted the root cause of why I wouldn\u2019t get into a car, but again, every trauma is different. \n\n- Meditations. Unfortunately there is no meditation that can just \u201ccure\u201d PTSD, even though I wish there was, but if you are experiencing other symptoms due to your PTSD, such as depression and anxiety, then there are definitely benefits of being medicated. I have been on antidepressants and anxiety meds for years now, and I really wish it was something I didn\u2019t need, but it definitely helps. \n\n- Service dog. There are plenty of tasks that a service dog can perform in order to help with PTSD. I don\u2019t know what specifically your trauma is from, but a couple specific tasks that they can perform include walking in front of you and checking the area around a corner, for example, and let you know that it is safe. They can also walk around you in circles, mainly in large crowds, in order to create a \u201cbubble\u201d between you and other people. Another task that would be helpful is deep pressure therapy, where the dog will lay on you in order to provide comfort and help ground you, or take you out of a flashback. This is also a task an Emotional Support Animal could preform. \n\nTreatments for PTSD can be expensive, but depending on the severity, you can get financial aid from VA disability (in the US). I didn\u2019t have this, but luckily the car accident(s) were not our fault and the other driver(s) had to cover it. \n\nAnyway, I hope this was helpful for you and I wish you the best of luck in finding the help you need!"
