                "Not a question, a statement: Quebec is a ridiculously bigoted province against their own countrymen, discriminating against speakers of one of the official languages of Canada. And they're such clowns about it too:\n\n>\u200b Last Thursday, Stephane Rh\u00e9aume, co-owner of Resto Mama Grilled Cheese, received a notice in the mail that the sign outside his restaurant was in violation of Quebec's French language laws. **His first offence: the use of the word \"enjoy\" on signage without a French equivalent in a more prominent font size. His second was a far graver crime: using the words \"grilled cheese.\"**  \n>  \n>Still, the **OQLF insisted that he use \"sandwich de fromage fondu,\"** which translates roughly to \"melted cheese sandwich\" to describe his offerings, a term that Rheaume says **he's never heard used by a single client.**  \n>  \n>\"It's never happened. The only difference between the French and the English, **is that the French, we usually say 'un grill cheese' instead of 'un grilled cheese.'** Usually we don't pronounce the 'D' but that's about the only nuance.\"\n\n\u200b [https://www.vice.com/en/article/4xb39p/quebecs-language-police-dont-want-you-to-order-a-grilled-cheese](https://www.vice.com/en/article/4xb39p/quebecs-language-police-dont-want-you-to-order-a-grilled-cheese)\n\nAlso, secondly, culture and language is a strict meritocracy. People should be able to speak French while receiving essential services (government, health, etc.) from birth to death in a place of French origin, but if English wins out due to people wanting English, then English is superior. The free market is perfectly capable of determining what language ought be used in the workplace, in a restaurant, etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFrancophone Quebecois have a chip on their shoulders from old history, but this is little different from a \"Keep our neighborhood Christian!\" level bigotry. But deep, deep down, Quebecois know that English has more economic value, more cultural value, etc. so nothing but state force and bigotry can stop the inevitable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have sympathy for non-extremists. I'm not good at learning other languages either (my spoken Arabic was described as \"terrible\" by one of the nicest people I know), but there's a difference between politely asking to be accommodated versus screaming \"ENGLISH MUST BE EQUALLY PROMINENT OR MORE PROMINENT, YOU FUCKING (SLURS),\" at people who use another language.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's time for the Canadian federal government to fix the situation. They should first prohibit all discrimination against either legal Canadian language, and then go further and give families choices. If a person wants to receive education in English primarily and learn French as a secondary language rather than vice versa, that should be easy to access. And while essential information (laws, health info, etc.) should be required to be available in both English and French, if a business wants to primarily market or work in either language, they should be entitled to do so.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, I guess my question is this: what, if anything, have you done to fight Anglophone discrimination and assure better language freedom and rights for fellow Quebecois?",
                "What do you think of this video?\n\n[https://youtu.be/KitLiKbIsSU?t=432](https://youtu.be/KitLiKbIsSU?t=432)\n\nMy exposure to Quebec/Canada politics is very limited, so please correct me if I'm wrong, but Quebec politics (at least on the national level) seems to mainly be based on insecurity and a bit of entitlement.\n\nA basic Canadian insecurity is that it lacks an identity outside of America, but I feel like Quebec has this insecurity x100 about eventually being anglo, so much so that it over-corrects to adopting what seems to be French-jingoism that it uses to excuse and ignore internal problems.\n\nI also mention a sense of entitlement, because criticism, no matter how measured and done in good faith, seems to be immediately dicarded and ridiculed. And because Quebec represents a large and vastly unified voting bloc, they keep getting away with behaviour no other demographic in Canada can do.\n\nJJ McCullough does a great job exemplifying these two points; what do you think of this video?\n\n[https://youtu.be/KitLiKbIsSU?t=339](https://youtu.be/KitLiKbIsSU?t=339)\n\nPersonally, I'm one of the Canadians that embraces the \"America-lite\" identity. I think being America's neighbour has led to some pretty sweet perks--having an economy that can punch well above it's weight, our citizens have relatively great economic opportunities, without having some of the most prominent toxic components of American culture (e.g. lack of healthcare, fetishistic gun culture, bombastic political culture and news cycle).\n\nAlso, what are the politics of the Bloc Quebecois? All I know is that it stands for Quebec interests, but how can one party balance the conservative and liberal components of its province in just one party?",

                "TheyI don't want to be rude, but how is Benin a good example? Patrice Talon must be one of the most epic clowns ever seen in West Africa. [His government named Pascal Nyamulinda, a Rwandan, as the Director of the ANIP (national identification number agency)](https://www.afro-impact.com/en/benin-pascal-nyamulinda-launches-a-new-enrolment-phase-for-ravip/). The best thing to do for any West African country is to don't follow Benin and his President who seem to believe that to appoint foreigners at some of the most critical positions is the smartest thing to do. \n\nThe debate about democracy is somehow useless. A democracy doesn't prevent you more than any other form of governance to put at the head of your country an idiot. A democracy just offer you \"in theory\" the peaceful option to change the idiot ruling your country. And often to put another idiot at this position. Too many Africans believe that African leaders are worse than Western leaders, but it's not true. The main difference is overall that Western leaders rule over countries with stronger institutions than African leaders. Western leaders aren't smarter. They just are in a setting where their mistakes cost less than mistakes made by African leaders. Do people really believe that Boris Johnson in UK or Macron in France would do something good in Africa? I was talking about clowns. They would safely compete for the gold medal in Africa. \n\nNow let me tell you something that fully apply to pretty much any Francophone West African country. \n\nFirstly, too many of us have been brainwashed by France about the beauty of democracy. Here don't get me wrong. I'm not preaching for dictatorship or any other authoritarian system. Here I'm telling you that too many of us in Francophone West Africa want to be a democracy but without to admit all the flaws that come with it once translated in our countries. To develop you need a plan. Not a short-term plan. You need a long-term plan. You need planning. You don't move out of a least developed country or developing country with over 30% of your population living below the poverty line just like that in a single mandate of 5 years. Not even in a double mandate of 5 years each. This is a speech which is populistic. You say what people want to hear. You take examples who worked outside of Africa because you know most of your people and the rest of audience will hardly try to check if it's inaccurate or not. Then you season this with anti-France speech or anti-West one. And you're the next most qualified leader. All you do is to lie. You lie and it works because people want to hear such lies. And when you arrive at the end of your journey as the leader of your country, people start to realise you lied. Sometimes the transition is peaceful, sometimes it's not. My point here is that people must admit they are part of the problem. They are the solution but they remain and will always remain part of the problem until the day they will admit their own mistakes instead of blaming anybody and everybody. And here I'm not trying to lower the impact of colonialism and neocolonialism. Here I'm trying to explain that if you always put yourself in a victim mentality where you would never be responsible for anything, then how do you expect things to change? \n\nSecondly, democracy if respected and with a limit of 2 mandates of 5 years means that your country will eventually be in this situation where the next president after the 2 mandates will be someone either from the opposition and who will do the dramatical opposite of what the last president did or someone from the same party but who will follow his own way to mark his footprint in the history of the country. This is why things hardly improve fast and efficiently. But this is something people don't want to admit when they brag here and there \"democracy\". Let me take Senegal as an example. The PSE (Plan for a Emerging Senegal) has worked so far because it was conducted under the presidency of the same president. Macky Sall. The phase 1 was from 2014 to 2018. Macky Sall was elected in 2012. He was re-elected in 2019. 7 years for the 1st mandate. Then 5 years because we changed the Constitution to limit a mandate to 5 years. The phase 2 started in 2019 and will end this year (2023). The phase 3 will start in 2024 until 2035. 2035 which is supposed to be when Senegal will have fully accomplished his transition. Macky Sall won't be president until then. He has less than a year as the President of Senegal. It's possible the next president will follow the PSE (phase 3) just like it's possible the next president will do everything else. And then what has worked so far will end. For better? Maybe. For worse? Maybe too. But Senegalese and especially Senegalese in Dakar and in other urbanised areas seem to love the idea of democracy more than anything else. Like if France and other Western countries telling us to value and defend democracy over anything else were democracy when they developed and not countries who became democracy after. Democracy is good, but democracy also implies that it's hard to plan things long-term which is what we need in priority. It's not because you say \"let's be a democracy\" that jobs will be created, electricity, hospitals and schools will be built, or that your people will suddenly stop struggling to eat enough each day. In Senegal we used to be a dictatorship with Senghor winning with 100% and no opponent to now a supposed democracy. Because yes, people often cite Senegal as an example of democracy but Senghor was elected few times with no opponent and 100% of votes. Unless I missed something we still have the same problems as before. And ironically it's under the megalomaniac A. Wade that all rural regions started to receive electricity and schools. The speech also changed quickly with Macky Sall. One day he was a good leader and democratic one doing good improvements. The next day when he wasn't clear if we would run for a 3rd mandate suddenly all did was bad and fake. \n\nAnd one more time, I'm not preaching for dictatorship. All I'm trying to tell here is that the form of governance matters way less than the competency of the ruler. People love to cite Sankara but Sankara was a military dictator. I mean Africans who praise Sankara are also almost always the same who praise democracy. Just be consistent. You can be a dictator like Sankara or you can be a dictator like Paul Biya. \n\nFinally, in Francophone West Africa, I've already said it few times but one of the main problem is \"hyper-presidentialism\" which is inflated and easily operative because the central power is disconnected from the rest of the country. Dakar in Senegal. Cotonou & Porto-Novo in Benin. Lom\u00e9 in Togo. Niamey in Niger. Bamako in Mali. Those are the most relevant examples. In any of those cities, if you move deep inner the country you could safely believe you're not in the same country. And yes this situation also exists in some other African countries, but in former French colonies in Sub-Saharan Africa the system is a presidential one. A presidential one inherited from France with all the flaws it has. The hyper-presidentialism we have is just an aggravated situation of hyper-presidentialism France started to know with Sarkozy and now with Macron who doesn't have any opposition. Presidentialism isn't a problem. Presidentialism based on a failing French presidentialism is. \n\nWe need stronger institutions to prevent a country to be only the reflect of his leader because this leader will move a day or another. We need to stop reasoning with Western concepts and values because our reality and what we have to overcome in priority aren't the same things as the countries we want to mimic. If your main worry is democracy instead of the at least 1/3 of people living under the poverty line, then I'm sorry but you're an idiot. We also need to dilute the central power through regionalism which would as a result increase the political representation of the country and so fuel a healthier debate and better options when we vote. And more important, we need to stop the joke with French language. When the President of Ghana speaks French better than the majority of \"Francophone\" West Africans, there is a problem no? Either we give it up or we invest massively to learn it. I mean a large part of students in Senegal are from African countries we can label as Francophone, including North Africa. They speak French better than average Senegalese. There is a problem. Education is the key. If the access to education is conditioned to a language over 50% of your people don't speak, you go nowhere. The debate isn't about French itself. We could put English it wouldn't change anything. Because at the end, democracy or not, even the dictators or military putschists we have had were more educated than 99% of the country where they live.",
                "Democracy is not perfect, is very annoying sometimes, and gets undermined from all ideological directions all the time.  \n\nBut, when politics is a giant tug-of-war, domestically, the small people of the country, who have little political power - which includes every single citizen not in their prime, so, a majority - is the most protected from extreme situations from lack of ideological balance.   \n\nAny semblance of democracy is something rare, precious and beautiful, in my opinion.  \n\nSure, you could absolutely luck out and get an authoritarian leader who is so good and kind and blah blah blah.  But we all know the existence of the other kind where lives, groups, can be snuffed out forever.  \n\nThe risk is too great and it is so hard to get back to balance once a despot grabs and entrenches power."

The rich and powerful realised how lucky they were and made sure the mistake would not be repeated. The right, the rich and powerful, the establishment media, cheered on by centrists and liberals helped ensure Labour were demolished in the 2019 GE. Now Labour have been taken over by the centre/centre right again.

                "priority bulling is the equivolent of stealing bases to me, it's a calculated risk that can offer big rewards or you punted the game for the whole pod. In the uncommon situations where you know a player you're passing to 100% has interaction, then obviously its a good play for you to priority bully. Otherwise, there's a decent chance you'll make yourself look like an ass when you let a win resolve. Frankly I dont think many players should engage in priority bullying based off hunches, at least in more casual cedh pods. I think the biggest challenge in cedh politics is trying to convince someone not to make a play that they think is good for them, but is overall bad for the table- priority bullying is a part of that. 3feri popping up more often is a great example of this type of politicking - a player casts 3feri to remove a stax piece that affects them but cant win the game, and now it's entirely up to the teferi player to stop the potential multiple win attempts from the other players. Another good example is when players feel like they \"need to do something since I'm so out of the game\" and this often is misusing a counterspell, removal piece, or sticking 3feri on the board. Usually this mentality comes from people who are expecting to play their cards and are a bit disappointed when they're staxed out of the game (which is fair, we've all been in that position), so they just want to cast ANY spell they can.",
                "You have full rights as the active player to pass priority to the players behind you if you believe they have answers to a problem or spell being cast. That being said, this does not mean you have the right to try and force them to counter or remove the spell you passed on.. in many cases, what may be detrimental to your gameplan isnt detrimental to theirs. In most scenarios, if you know a player behind you in priority has a counterspell, you should pass to them and bluff that you dont have a response. If they are a true cEDH player, and they assess that if the spell resolves they lose the game, they will counter it. However, bullying someone into countering a spell you could also have countered and THEY KNOW you could have countered is never a good idea, as it causes spite plays such as what happened in mox masters. \n\nIn general: dont be an ass, dont rely on other players to counter win attempts if ur bitching and moaning about it, as they likely would rather lose than let you win. Pass priority if they DONT KNOW YOUR HAND.",
                "I dont disagree with any specific sentiment of your video, just some semantics.  \n\n\nI dont know if terms have changed in recent years, but this was not what 'priority bullying' used to describe. What you're describing never had a specific name (as far as I know).  \n\n\nPriority bullying is (was?) a \\*VERY SPECIFIC\\* action where NAP1 would pass priority on a spell, NAP2 would pass, and before NAP3 passed, NAP1 would say \"I can interact, but I need you too pass priority back to me to do so by tapping all of your lands.\" NAP1 would then counter AP's spell after they had ensured that NAP2 and 3 did not have any ability to make mana once it became NAP1's turn.  \n\n\nHere's a video, though he seems to call it Mana Bullying: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u\\_cTnDIQvAQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_cTnDIQvAQ)  \n\n\nHere is another example of Play to Win describing \"Priority Bullying\" exactly as I just did: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OduW\\_MQpYmQ&t=41s  \n\n\nIt was an extremely narrow situation, not simply \"I used my higher priority to not use resources and instead make NAP2 and NAP3 use theirs\". But I guess all language evolves. Maybe this is what Priority Bullying means now. \n\n**The most important difference between the situation you described and what is commonly referred to (or was referred to) as 'Priority Bullying' is that in 'my' definition of 'Priority Bullying', NAP1 has every intention of using their interaction and does not have knowledge of the other players' hands at all, but is simply using their priority to force the other players to tap out.**\n\n  \nYour situation where NAP1 knows NAP3 has interaction, this is not priority bullying, this is simply... playing the game. NAP1 had no ill will and was acting in good faith passing to NAP3 so NAP3 would use their interaction. With 'my' Priority Bullying definition, NAP1 would be using a rule that arguably shouldnt even exist in order to extort the table into unfairly giving up resources.  \n\n\nSorry for the long response. More than happy to engage with anyone who does disagrees with what I thought Priority Bullying is, as long as they start their comment with \"I read your full comment, however...\" (keeps me from having to retype stuff in sub-comments because I'll know whoever responded did, in fact, read what I had to write here, and simply disagrees with it or has more to add)",

I know that I\u2019ve had some problems with having to explain certain things to younger readers, particularly surrounding the Vietnam War. \n\nKing\u2019s political views have always been clear in his writing, so long as you were familiar with the context that existed in the time periods during which he wrote. Some books are certainly more obvious than others, and some are lacking in much more than a few dry statements made by the characters just as reference to the news of the day.\n\nI would agree that some of his political content is less oblique than it used to be, but I feel that is sort of a reflection more upon the times than the writer himself. These days it feels like you have to forgo nuance in order to make sure people don\u2019t mistake your meaning.

This is strongly seen in countries that have strong \"left and right\" sides, like in Latin America (literal fascism and literal communism), as opposed to the US which actually has \"right wing and extreme right wing\", but I imagine a similar effect must be generated.",

            "title": "Body politic, or why minecraft civilizations should be heterogenous",
            "selftext": "It's been about a year since my [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivEx/comments/n7bzmu/culture_or_how_a_civilization_experiment_server/) and I'm in a thinking-about-civilization mood again. Civilization Experiment continues to make an impression on my mind, and the concept of a modeled society in minecraft is fascinating.\n\nCivEx has traditionally had a habit of creating nations on paper before they are established in game. Even before 1.0 launched, there was a flurry of recruitment posts for the first 8 nations based on a variety of simple themes. Some of these nations died out while others lasted for the entire iteration in one form or another. 2.0 saw the revival of a few 1.0 nations and its own slew of nation ideas, some of which failed spectacularly. Irongrad and Verrenteros come to mind, as does my own Underfoot. This practice continued in later versions up until First Light. If there was a CivEx server online tomorrow I would imagine that most nations would arise the same way they always did, just organized on discord instead of reddit.\n\nA perennial problem has been OMNs or one-man nations. These little claims would originate just the same as any other nation, but fail to recruit any players besides their founder. The leaders of these 'nations' would attempt to create land claims, establish diplomatic ties, and create a constitutional body while lacking any kind of community or internal politics. Most people write them off and they typically died within a few weeks.\n\nMost nations, whether successful or not, would revolve around a relatively tight group of friends who have banded together outside of game. This has had an unfortunate effect of creating politically homogeneous factions with minimal internal politics. I will argue here that the fundamental process of nation formation and recognition is malleable and that future Civilization Experiment servers should attempt to encourage organic and heterogeneous civilizations.\n\n**Organic and Artificial Nations**\n\nNations typically arise on Civilization servers one of two ways. They can arise artificially through external consolidation, or internally through the results in-game interactions. These attributes aren't mutually exclusive and form a spectrum between a 'fully artificial' group of five buddies planning their settlement in a discord group chat or 'fully organic' group of five strangers under complete anarchy building their houses next to each other.\n\nAn example of organic development that saw wild success was Mt. Augusta on Civcraft servers. The city-state began as a small town on a hill, which had created an extremely limited form of government. There was no official public property, meaning that players mostly built and mined on their own while participating in a broader community. That's a high level of economic granularity compared to most nations on modern civilization servers, where factories and bunkers are on a series of national groups and shared between all members of a nation. The city saw massive influx of newfriends due to its low barrier to entry. \n\nI have attempted my own experiment in organic organization on CivEx. Wolfsville started with me building a house in a valley and recruiting people who happened to boat by. Few members were people who I had known before hand, yet the town grew to moderate size and a community took shape. The closest international ties were with Jamanic, which was across the water. \n\nArtificial organization isn't necessarily bad on a civilization server. People will always organize with their friends to achieve common objectives in game. The ability to cooperate on grinding resources and building defenses is the basis for a civilization in the first place. However, not every faction needs to be its own polity. It's much more interesting when these groups join an existing nation as a subculture or company. On CivRealms, the community of Veria had a high level of internal cohesion and unity while participating in the broader society of Norlund, to great political effect. \n\n**Internal Politics**\n\nThose of you who read the post title are probably either wondering what I meant by 'body politic' or waiting for me to get to the point. Society can be likened to an organism in which individuals are cells and the social entities they make up are tissues and organs. The idea is that this 'body' of individuals constitutes a sovereign due to the implicit contract between all participating citizens. \n\nWatered-down Hobbes aside, what would this look like in a virtual civilization? Fundamentally it requires a shift in the way civilizations are perceived, from clans and factions to legal entities that supersede the granular social relations of any two citizens. Ideally a civilization of this type woudn't simply allow for players of the same nation to feud with one another, but require a legal system to govern the society it arises from. Essentially, internal politics only become interesting when the nation-state is larger than the social groups it includes. If you have a small group of friends playing together in one nation, it's silly to write a code of laws or constitution. \n\n**The Grind**\n\nOne common feature of civilization-style servers is the use of mechanics to encourage people to work together. I don't want to get bogged down in specifics, but it should be sufficient to say that ten people grinding together have it easier than those same ten people grinding for resources on their own. This is somewhat true in vanilla minecraft and a veritable fact on servers with FactoryMod or Essence. \n\nA consequence of this is that it's smart to have a national namelayer group and grant access to common infrastructure based on citizenship. Most civilizations have had a public storage, but today it seems that most of any civilization's wealth is done on national groups. The majority of wealth is grinded in public bunkers, public factories, public farms, and public iceroads.\n\nThis puts a lot of power in the hands of whoever owns the national groups, who can on a whim add or revoke anyone's access to the totality of a nation's public services. Democracy on CivEx has always been something of a joke, and it only becomes harder to establish when one person has all of the real power in any given organization. If it does ever become really feasible, there needs to be either fundamental changes to the way that namelayer works or less investment required for grinding. A healthy civilization should see numerous corporations operating their own factories independent of the public bunker.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI won't say that CivEx has failed, but it certainly did fail to model the internal heterogeneity of a civilization. A new civilization experiment should focus on subnational as well as international issues which can serve as foci for cooperation and conflict. How this will be done exactly is worth discussing, but I have a few ideas:\n\n* Nations will probably have to get bigger, encompassing not only multiple 'friend groups' but also various subcultures and organizations.\n\n* A smaller map size would encourage prospective OMNs to either join an existing group or obtain permission to settle from someone else, leading to social heterogeneity. \n\n* Investment for factories and XP production could be significantly reduced in a new server. This would lower the bar of entry to industrial production and take the focus away from nation-based grinding. It would also allow the average noob to have greater political and economic sway, which lowers the influence of powergamers.\n\n*  The use of large 'city bastions' to claim and protect a nation's settled area might be worth questioning. It puts the right to reinforce blocks within the hands of the territory owners, who can grant or revoke bastion group access. Without bastions, the property divisions within any given city can be more granular and individualistic.\n\n* Servers should encourage more social interaction in-game and less on external websites like reddit and discord. While the creation of national discord chats is inevitable for the foreseeable future, official discord verification and integration with services like Kira may not be beneficial.\n\nCivilization is a tricky thing to get right. If you have any other ideas, please share them with me! I'd be happy to hear who agrees and who disagrees.",

I don\u2019t need this nonsense in my life. \n\nHonestly it\u2019s thanks to these posts and Reddit that the decision to cut contact was so clear to me, but I have to admit I\u2019m shaking as I write this.

                "I stayed somewhere for nearly ten years when I should have left the first week. The Great Recession had me convinced I wouldn't find anywhere else that would pay well enough to cover the bills. It was nuts. There was so much toxic drama it sounds made up when I write it all out.\n\nI was interviewing during that time, but that was also a shit show. One person called me at home after an interview to warn me that their place was horribly toxic. I'll forever be grateful to that woman, she took a risk by calling me but felt it was important to warn other women not to work there. I hope she found something far better herself.\n\nEventually, the decision was made for me, when the overgrown mean girl who owned the cursed company fired all of us because we were not reacting well to her very weird team-building meeting that went off the rails and appeared to be headed toward physical violence. \n\nSince then, I have learned something that led to a better opportunity. I found that I could use different parts of my skill set to land a job in manufacturing where I get to work alone all day in a workshop while I listen to audio books. It pays more than double what that horrible full time office gig with a commute did, and I get the work done and go home on my own schedule.\n\n The boss is not awesome, but he's not horrible either, and as long as I can stay in the workshop and only see him for \"hi\" and \"bye\"or anything relevant to a custom job, it's going to be OK.",

I came back to getting grunt work assigned to me for 3 straight days, totally unskilled work.  I asked my boss if I was being punished for going on vacation and was told if I didn't want to be there I could take my things and leave \n\nMe and my wife were already talking about me leaving the job, so I went home and we went through our finances to see if it was responsible.  The next morning, I called the boss on my way in and let him know I would be picking up my belongings before the start of the day. \n\nI have exactly zero regrets, and it is closing in on a year off work.

I manually seeded 7 acres of land without so much as a thank you. Planted something like 70 saplings without a thank you. Then when we tried to explain holdups on site, it was always my fault. Even if it was becasue something was delayed on the shipping. I would convey exactly was a subcontractor told me to him. But that was still my fault somehow. Ended up quitting without notice. We hired this amazing super who knew everything about construction. He started looking for a new job within 2 days of starting. \n\nThis president was truly an evil human.

He has no managerial skills but got the position because no one else wanted the job. And I get the work sucks because higher ups expect all this crap from him, some of the time stuff that has already gone through in years past but was ignored and so they want the same crap done again later on even though they probably wont go through with said recommendations etc. But still doesn't give him the right to get pissy at others and constantly push more work onto everyone else. \n\nEver since he got hired it's been \"keep busy\" anytime he sees me (mostly me it seems like) not constantly working all the damn time. Or offloading more crap onto me cause I don't appear \"busy\" all the damn time I guess. Constantly having to drop what im doing to work on the newest task I was given. Only to be told time and time again that I leave stuff and/or don't finish tasks I was given etc. \n\nOr how during the pandemic I basically couldn't take time off at all cause we were short staffed and working over 40 hours a week at times. Haven't really had time off since around the end of 2019. Also being harassed about wearing a face mask at work because none of my coworkers ever wore any during the pandemic and yet multiple times of possibly being exposed to someone who have covid and still come to work putting people like me at risk. \n\nI already know eventually my boss will get on my case about \"why didn't you finish x?\" or \"you were suppose to get Y done why isn't it done yet?\" because he neglects the fact that most of the time he's the one who will turn around and tell me to work on some new crap he decided we need to focus on (even though it's clear nothing has changed and we already have done these tasks in the past) and thus I have to drop what im doing. \n\nMeanwhile I am considered responsible for a bunch of different stuff these days. Some of which I haven't been able to even really touch for a year. Meanwhile other coworkers are sitting so many feet away playing on their phone, or focusing on what to make for lunch sometimes. \n\nIt also doesn't help that I signed up for this job to do certain stuff. When I got hired there was no mention of having to do this that or the other thing but years later here I am. And some of said stuff I am bugged about is stuff that other jobs have actual professionals do for a living and get paid way more for. \n(And no, im not going to go work at said jobs, cause im not fluent or have a degree in said crap thus I wont get hired, not to mention there aren't any of said jobs locally anyways even if I could. I just know some basic stuff but I shouldn't be required to do this crap for the crapy pay they are paying me for doing it)\n\nAnd yeah I know I should find a job somewhere else. Unfortunately this job is considered one of the better ones in my small city. I was in the process of trying to go on trips each year to find where I might want to move to which started near the end of 2019... unfortunately then the pandemic happened so kinda got screwed out of that. Maybe next year I might be able to. Though still don't want to get covid and it's still a thing all over the world in different places so yeah.",

Bad, even lossy years happen,  and 20% seems like something that only happens in a  good year.\n\nMost BIG investments take years before they start paying off.  Subsidised schooling for instance doesn't have any payout till after your first students graduate.\n\nFor a slightly more complex system you could split investments into groups. Did they invest in schools, healthcare, environment, employement or a new harbour? And set when payback starts and a % per die table for each group.",

And of note is that rice farming, as practiced substantially in Southern Asia, is a lot more infrastructurally involved than much European agriculture and thus probably deviates a bit from that laid out above (that, alongside the many rivers, might be one part of why Chinese civilisation so consistently outstripped Europe in development and state power up to the industrial revolution).",

It may not be flawless, sure, and it depends on competent judge and, in the case of grand jury, competent jury foreman/woman, leadership as well, but it can be strikingly good.   Is it a powerful enough system to escape even politics?  I\u2019m not 100% sure, but I would bet it is. \n\nOf course, the second they leave the jury room, our locals turn their normal prejudiced selves back on like a light switch\u2026. \n\nEdit: On the last jury duty, the judge found out about my abnormally high jury duty load and ordered the recorder to \u201clet this poor guy off for ten years\u201d.",

                "There are lots of ways it\u2019s done. \n\nRussia has a unique advantage in that a lot of former Soviet republics (Georgia, Ukraine [probably not any more], Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Armenia, Latvia, Uzbekistan) and a couple other countries (most notably Israel, but recently Hungary) have judges that are former members of the USSR fed - and some of those judges straight up still live in Moscow. This means Russia can have up to around half a panel of Russian judges - and will usually have at least 2-3 on any given panel. So they can work together to get Russian skaters to the top. In fact a common conspiracy theory is that Russia lets a lot of good - but not top - Russian skaters switch to these countries so that there will be more pro-Russian judges on panels. \n\nOther countries don\u2019t have that advantage. There\u2019s a lot of speculation on politicking that these countries do. In order of most plausible to least plausible/conspiracy:\n\n* The influence of inflated national scoring on the opinion of judges. While the scores are obviously inflated, international judges do pay attention to them and which skaters score the best at nationals. This influences their pecking order and where they put PCS at (even if it shouldn\u2019t). Obviously they don\u2019t score as inflated as at nationals.\n\n* The countries advertising their top skaters and saying \u201clook at how good they are\u201d: ads, sponsorship deals, posters the judges see, etc. Judges may also meet and/or judge the skaters through the years and learn to like them - and how much that happens depends on how much the federation lets it happen. \n\n* Judges chatting about skaters. We know judges talk to each other, and they have a room to talk to each other in. Of course judges can talk up skaters from their country to judges from other countries. \n\n* Judges trying to convince other judges who should win. Technically banned, but probably happens. Just like fans I\u2019m sure judges talk about what they hate/like about each team. But whether or not they actively go hard into it or if it\u2019s just a friendly debate is, well, debatable. \n\n* Trying to get favorable panels. Hard to do and hard to predict in the IJS era, but certainly there is a strategy to trying to get more people who like you on the podium. (Easy for Russia - and though China in theory has Taiwan and Hong Kong it doesn\u2019t work out; much harder for other countries)\n\n* Judges and federations trying to bargain with other judges/federations about podiums (eg. If you help X win men\u2019s, we\u2019ll help Y win women\u2019s) - this would have to happen across disciplines and involve bargaining that is very pre-planned. While this did happen in 6.0, there is no evidence it has happened since - though that didn\u2019t stop the V/M and Yuna fan conspiracy theory from Sochi. \n\n* Bribery of judges. A very common conspiracy theory, but the one with the least evidence of.",
                "Honestly unless your are a judge or official you won\u2019t know the specifics, so people here can only make assumptions. Generally it\u2019s assumed that feds bring their officials to events and network with other officials, judges and technical specialists. Making sure your skater is known can mean your guy gets the benefit of the doubt for GOE and tech calls that others wouldn\u2019t. \n\nOn the coaches side we look at Gadbois and see how they have teams from all over. A British judge has interest to mark up Gadbois teams because a high tide rises all boats and the British team skating there will look good as well.",
                "Though county's federation may favour one skater doesn't always make exactly him getting higher points. For example, Judges on international events always favoured Alina Kostornaya over Sherbackova (really, when Aliona was in best shape Anna should not have stayed even close to her points). However in Russia it was Anna whoose scores where way to high above her level, and judges didn't favoured much Alena. \nBut overall it's very very complicated question",
                "No idea, but I picture the judges watching practices laughing at each other's jokes really loudly, pointing at skaters they want to overscore and giving each other the thumbs up.  \n\nThen they invite the Lithuanian judge out for cigars or something.",
                "It's doubtful that people actually in the know post on here so you won't get an accurate answer. \n\nAnd sometimes politics is thrown around as a reason for a low score when people just don't want to admit that their personal favourites had a less than optimal skate, and that skaters they don't personally like were good.",
                "Most commonly, they trade scores with judges.  Something like - Country A is judging pairs but they don't have a team competing. Country B has a pairs team they want to promote,  but aren't judging pairs.  They are judging men's, which Country A has an individual they want to promote.  There is what is referred to as a \"Gentleman's Agreement\" (nothing in writing, nothing officially committed to) that the two countries will over score the others athletes.\n\nIce Dance politics is a whole nother thing.  I feel like I only know a bit of it, so I'll more informed folks explain that craziness.",
                "There are lots of things that come to mind and it depends on the sport\u2026 different forms of bribery\u2014 could be treating judges to expensive vacations,  or direct $$ bribery through the federations resources. It could be more subtle like travel expenses or meals. Or as someone else put meetings\u2014 recall Sotnikova hugging a judge. It could be something like the TeamTutberidze branding that skews judges\u2019 views.\n\nIt can also be a I scratch your back and you\u2019ll scratch mine thing for good and consistent scoring. This is what most people mean."

People generally don't stress.  No big affixes in these.\n\nOnce you get int 10's, 11's and higher, gear definitely makes a difference and so do mechanics.  It's harder to heal someone and harder to kill stuff.  It starts taking a toll on the atmosphere of the group.  People rage quit and sit in long queues.  More affixes.\n\nThen (around 18's)  you get over the hump with gear and you're better acquainted with dungeon mechanics (hopefully).",
                "Because at that point there is way more agreement, unspoken at that, on the purpose of the group.\n\nIn lower keys you will have more differing opinions on what they\u2019re there to do. For some it\u2019s farming score. Others it might be crests. Those two both want timed runs, but the IO-focused is likely less patient with mistakes since they may gain nothing if it fails, where aspects still drop at least, affording more patience on the gamble (and because for the crest farmer there\u2019s no difference at all between +1 and +2/3). Then there\u2019s the spectrum of weekly completers- from those who really want times to push the key up to those who don\u2019t care at all. Even more- those willing to suffer a miserable key because they\u2019re only doing the one, versus those in for 4 or more and less okay with that.\n\nAbove 20 for sure, but really 18+ since it\u2019s more understood at 17s are good enough for vault w/aspects to upgrade, the agreement is almost always unilaterally to time it. Anything less and it just is what it is- leave and on to the next.\n\nAs for how they feel to heal- skill level on average increases. Since nothing changes after 14 mechanically, you start to see better play the higher up you go. It\u2019s just scaling health and damage, the mechanics are fixed and thus seen and practiced more. Problem with the lower key levels is their affixes aren\u2019t as consistent. Running a 5 looks a lot different than a 7, which looks a lot different than a 14. So you have a wider range of players going into them, as they\u2019re just more accessible, and then having to learn new things as they inch upwards in difficulty.",

People in the lower keys that are trying to work their way up but aren't actually good enough at the game to make it there tend to have a bad mindset when it comes to improving, they will blame things going wrong on others instead of thinking \"what could I have done better?\" which means they flame other people and are perpetually stuck in that range of keys. These players also tend to think they are way better than they actually are, the equivalent of the LoL player that thinks they should be diamond but are hard stuck in silver because \"my teammates suck\". So ofcourse, if you think you're good and the problem is other people, why try to improve.\n\nThe second is the goal, in keys up to 17 the general goal is to get vault slots and crests and gear, you can go up to 20's for these things but really 17's are the limit of what most people will do for this later in the season as it gets you hero track items and the highest level crest, and now with the myth track existing there is no point in doing a 20 when you can just do a 16 or 17 and get a 441 piece that you just upgrade to 447 as if you'd done a 20 in the first place. The people that go beyond that are looking for something different, they might be looking to time some 20's for teleports, they might be looking to go beyond that and try and push score because they enjoy the competitive aspect and want to push their own limits and improve as a player. There is also an expectation that not every key will be timed on the first attempt the higher the key level is.\n\nThere are many more reasons like having a better understanding of the game and thus knowing what it is that is going wrong so instead of just being frustrated that things aren't going well, being able to identify issues and fixing them in a productive way but the 2 I mentioned before this feel like the 2 biggest ones to me.",

If someone dies they know that pull had 3 Apparatus' that all targeted that one person and no defensive or healer alive could have saved them. They are also more experienced in timing keys and they know that little mistakes don't instantly brick the key. A lot of mid tier keys die because there is an early wipe and people don't understand that the key is still very timeable.\n\nThere is still some toxicity in the higher keys. But that toxicity comes from genuinely toxic people, and isn't a circumstance of experience.\n\nThat's *generally* been my experience anyway.",
                " 11-16 is mostly people who think they're good but  don't actually know what's happening so they tend to get more tilted and take a fuck ton of damage and then blame the tank or healer because they've died 2 million times.\n\n18 - 22+ Good players that actually have a decent understanding of the game and realise everyone fucks up sometimes so they tend to be more chill",
                "Maybe I've just been unlucky but I don't find the same 18+ groups as you.\n\nAt the 13-16 dungeons I find the somewhat irritating tanks that want you go way too fast 'because its only low level guys' like when levelling a new char and if something goes wrong blame anything but themselves (and I'd really like to go back into stealth between packs for improved bleeds)\n\nBut then at 18+ I see either way more toxicity in general, gatekeeping, people barely replying or communicating and leaving way, WAY more often than below when they think the timer is even getting slightly tight!",
                "11-16 are fake NPCs that are there to lure you into M+ hell and to call you trash. 20+ are real players that value their time. With a few NPCs sprinkled in. Join WoW made easy discord they will get you past the hump and help with mechanics."

But other court papers and Federal Elections Commission data show they are Nishad Singh and Ryan Salame.  \n>  \n>Singh, FTX\u2019s former engineering chief, pleaded guilty to fraud and campaign finance violations in February. He donated $9.7 million to Democratic candidates and causes, and said in court he knew the money came from FTX customers.  \n>  \n>Salame, the former co-CEO of FTX\u2019s Bahamian unit, gave more than $24 million to Republican candidates and causes in the 2022 election cycle, according to Federal Election Commision data.  \n>  \n>He has not been accused of wrongdoing, and his lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The only legitimate excuse to not workout is because you don't feel like it which is totally acceptable so long as you don't also complain about the results of not working out.\n\nu/AlertAd947, [your comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/15bwodd/comment/jtt9l3z/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) is both a sad reflection of humanity and hilarious. It also highlights another valid reason not to go to the gym, having to interact with buff losers.",

Also in this day and age there is so much info online if you want to learn how to use gym equipment. Also if you ask the gym employees they will show you how to use equipment. Also personal trainers can help out. \n\nHow do posts like this make it on here?",

                "A thought from a former professional strength and conditioning coach. It is worth the admittedly high cost of paying for some professional training in order to learn the proper way to train your body. The return on investment comes in the form of greatly reduced risk of injury and in results which will be an entire order of magnitude higher than what you get from following trendy workout advice.\n\nThe catch is that in order to choose the right person from the crowded field of \"certified professionals\" out there, many of whom are no better than snake oil salesmen, you will need to learn some of the fundamentals of what training does to the body and why.",
                "That's just an excuse. Most people know someone who would be willing to show them the ropes, and if not there's always YouTube.

In the event the machine doesn\u2019t have any labels, ask someone at the gym or take a picture and ask in an online forum (like Reddit).\n\nThis is a minor problem that has easy solutions. Yes, I\u2019m an introvert and don\u2019t like the idea of asking someone at the gym how to use equipment. And yes, I\u2019ve been going to the gym for 2+ years now and still check if I\u2019m doing things right. But none of these are legitimate reasons to not go to the gym.",

You can YouTube the name of the machine, which is usually written on it, to watch a how-to video. Or you can ask someone, most are happy to help. \n\nThere are also usually staff around during the day and early evening to help if needed. \n\nStop making excuses for not going if you actually want to go. Pick 3-4 things you can figure out. You can even research ahead of time before going. Then branch out as you feel comfortable. If you are ok with the cost, you can hire a personal trainer for 1-3 sessions. They'll give you a rundown of the equipment and make suggestions.",

                "DeSantis did real damage to Disney.  He damaged the business and the brand, to the tune of several billions of dollars.  The attack was a constitutional violation, and he did it willfully and intentionally.   And now, he has confirmed that he did it in bad faith, as a publicity stunt.\n\nSeems to me, he owes Disney some thing more than an offer to stop punching.  Some serious amount of damages, and a consent decree.   DeSantis should resign from office, resign his law license, and never run for political office again.   I don't see any of that happening voluntarily.",
                " \n\nThe fact that Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is now trying to back away from his fight with the Walt Disney Company should confirm at least one thing about the whole ugly mess.\n\nIt was never a principled fight against special privileges granted to a private company. It was a political stunt meant to raise DeSantis' profile on the national stage.\n\nThat mission having been accomplished\u2014and with the prospects of a legal battle against Disney looming\u2014DeSantis told CNBC on Monday that he has \"moved on\" from the issue. He also encouraged Disney to \"drop the lawsuit\" that it filed against his administration.\n\nIn that lawsuit, Disney claimed that DeSantis led a \"targeted campaign of government retaliation\" after the company's then-CEO, Bob Chapek, had spoken out against DeSantis' decision to sign a bill limiting the discussion of gender and sexuality in grade school classrooms. (The ban was later to include nearly all public school classrooms in the state.) DeSantis responded to that criticism by launching a crusade against Disney's special self-governing district, the Reedy Creek Improvement District, culminating in the passage of a state law that gave the governor the authority to appoint a new board to run the zone.\n\nDeSantis and his allies have framed that maneuver as a strike against corporate special interests, but Disney's lawsuit makes a compelling case that the governor specifically targeted Disney to punish the company for Chapek's comments. The complaint draws from numerous public statements and from remarks made within DeSantis'\u00a0recently published book to argue that Desantis punished Disney for constitutionally protected speech.\n\nIt makes a lot of sense for DeSantis to try to walk away from this fight, in no small part because getting his butt kicked in federal court over a fairly fundamental constitutional issue wouldn't be a good look for a guy who is hoping to become president. Even if he doesn't lose, the lawsuit will be an ongoing source of bad news for DeSantis and will give reporters the opportunity to ask questions he'd rather not have to deal with\u2014like the newly uncovered ethics violations , surrounding one of the people DeSantis appointed to the Reedy Creek board. Ending the fight would also save taxpayers from having to foot the legal bills for DeSantis' defense, which is nice.\n\nStill, getting out of this mess is probably not as simple as asking Disney to drop the lawsuit and move on. Does DeSantis intend to ask the state Legislature to undo the governor's control over the Reedy Creek board? If not, then why should Disney back down?\n\nShort of that, it would be useful for reporters to ask DeSantis whether he would take similar actions against other businesses whose executives criticize his policies. Disney obviously has the power to fight back, but others might not be able to do so. Is DeSantis willing to admit he was wrong to retaliate against Disney? The answer would be instructive for voters weighing his candidacy for higher office.\n\nUltimately, though, DeSantis' attempt to \"move on\" from the fight with Disney reveals how unserious the whole thing was. If this were a principled stand against corporatism, as DeSantis has claimed, it would be worth seeing the fight through to the finish. That was never the case, however, and it looks like DeSantis simply wants to end this political stunt before it blows up in his face.",
                ">after the company's then-CEO, Bob Chapek, had spoken out against DeSantis' decision to sign a bill limiting the discussion of gender and sexuality in grade school classrooms.\n\nIt was more than that. DeSantis' anti-woke bill also prohibited private sector corporations from teaching diversity programs to their employees. It was bad enough that he was forcing public schools to adhere to his white supremacist propaganda, but he expects corporations to do it, too. That's a clear violation of a corporation's 1st amendment rights, and as Mitt Romney reminded us all \"Corporations are people, too, my friend.\"\n\nSo a company like Disney, the largest single site employer in the United States, in one of the most diverse regions in America, who actively hires people from all over the world, and all walks of life, is legally prohibited from offering guidelines to their extremely diverse employee base about how to get along with, and tolerate, each others' many differences. \n\nAnd it doesn't just apply to Disney but all Florida Corporations. Orlando Health has recently been running an ad promoting their cancer treatment services, featuring a trans woman doctor, while making no mention of the doctor's orientation. They had several doctors they could have featured, but they chose this one to represent them in this ad. It seems like Orlando Health, whose hospital is right up the street from Pulse, and was the place who treated the Pulse victims that night, is sending a message to the state government about which side of the line they are on. \n\nI also recently noticed on the Publix website that they have \"gender-neutral\" restrooms. In the store they call them \"Family\" restrooms, but on their website, they are using the \"gender-neutral\" term, which is more triggering to conservatives. Perhaps Publix, a huge employee owned Florida corporation with a very diverse workforce, is sending a similar message to the the state government. \n\nCorporations generally don't like being told what to do by politicians. They see themselves in the opposite position, and DeSantis has stepped out of line, and major Florida corporations are starting to push back.",

Even if he doesn't lose, the lawsuit will be an ongoing source of bad news for DeSantis and will give reporters the opportunity to ask questions he'd rather not have to deal with\u2014like the\u00a0newly\u00a0uncovered\u00a0ethical issues\u00a0surrounding one of the people DeSantis appointed to the Reedy Creek board. Ending the fight would also save taxpayers from having to foot the legal bills for DeSantis' defense, which is nice.\n\nStill, getting out of this mess is probably not as simple as asking Disney to drop the lawsuit and move on. Does DeSantis intend to ask the state Legislature to undo the governor's control over the Reedy Creek board? If not, then why should Disney back down?\n\nShort of that, it would be useful for reporters to ask DeSantis whether he would take similar actions against other businesses whose executives criticize his policies. Disney obviously has the power to fight back, but others might not be able to do so. Is DeSantis willing to admit he was wrong to retaliate against Disney? The answer would be instructive for voters weighing his candidacy for higher office.\n\nUltimately, though, DeSantis' attempt to \"move on\" from the fight with Disney reveals how unserious the whole thing was. If this were a principled stand against corporatism, as DeSantis has claimed, it would be worth seeing the fight through to the finish. That was never the case, however, and it looks like DeSantis simply wants to end this political stunt before it blows up in his face.",

What I think you are looking at are extremes and irrelevancies: while an Ivy League education may be out of range for most, only once has were I went to college made any difference as to whether or not I got a job (the interviewer had a bad experience with the school I went to and ended the interview as soon as she saw where I went without considering whether or not I was qualified; the company went out of business shortly there after because it was that poorly run); meanwhile, the fact someone makes $10 more than me takes away nothing from me since the economy is not a zero-sum game.\n\nMeanwhile a growing number of schools are moving to a financing model where, instead of tuition and loans, you agree to pay a percentage of your income for a number of years, making education more affordable and more likely to result in stable, quality employment.",

                "A great many words written on the debt created by education and a university degree, and the lack of opportunities that follow, leading to less of the good life.\n\nThe problem is many young adults the world over pursue a degree before they even have a use for it, because they're 'steered' into that path by well meaning but clueless teachers, parents and the media. Not all degrees guarantee you workforce security or a decent wage but young adults are not told this, or are not told just how hard they're making it for themselves if they select the wrong degree (History for example). Many of the classmates I graduated with only stated looking at careers once they'd graduated at 21... smh. Some career options are just not suited to a university degree at all.\n\nTo get the best out of a degree or any education, you need to pick the career / trade first, ***then*** the education but this never happens. You wouldn't go out to buy 4\" paint brush and then complain when you get back home that you can't write your shopping list on a piece of A4 with it would you? But this is what happens with our education.\n\nIt's not the ultra wealthy that's keeping the proletariat poor, it's poor choices in education and careers to begin with. Colleges and schools don't care about poor choices as get they their fees regardless, which is why they're silent about this and students only realize the mistake made after the fact. **A free market rewards those that give it what it wants. If you have the right skills to offer then you will get the rewards with some hard work and a bit of luck.** The system does work IMHO, the issue is, many students & people are just clueless about picking good careers / figuring out where market demand is to begin with and / or expect their career choices to last for ever. They don't. They never did. It's just a shame no one explains this.\n\nIf you're in a declining industry or have an unwanted degree then you have to move. Many options here. Start at the bottom again and work up, or cross train at your own cost. No new degree required, just plenty of experienced friends to advise you on what's really needed.",

It\u2019s a giant opinion topic beyond things we can universally agree on like inflation. \n\nFor example; what if instead of going to a massive private or state affiliated university everyone went to community college for two years, ensured their credits would transfer to a larger school, and at the end of two years transferred\u2026.what would the cost of education look like then? What would the cost of education look like if\u2026.you attended a state university instead of a private or state affiliated private university? I\u2019ll tell you what the cost would look like\u2026..you\u2019d get a big name college degree for a fraction of the cost every idiot who wants the big name college experience pays. Hell, there are trade union apprenticeships and trade schools available as well\u2026aside from the trade programs offered at community colleges. So keeping this in mind; is it impossible or difficult to get an advanced degree?? Not really; he\u2019ll you could also join the military or the peace corps and get money for school, or work a job at McDonalds or other places with a scholarship fund towards education or sign up for a state promise program where your education is covered by the state you live in for certain degrees as long as you agree to stay working in that state for a few years.",

                "The Gadsden Flag, known for the Snake in the grass with the words \"don't tread on me\" is a symbol of a persons ability to defend themself. Despite what various political groups will tell you, it is not a symbol that is representing one single group; it is not a symbol of the left, right, center, or upside down. No one group owns it; it's a symbol of every citizen in the US and out of the US\n\nThe basic symbol is the snake in the grass; it minds its business and has no intention to harm anyone unless you step on it (tread) it will then bite as a form of defense to preserve its own life. The snake is typically symbolism for an armed citizen of the US. having a firearm, and having the capacity to do harm, but being responsible enough to keep to ones self unless attacked or \"treaded on\" by other people; or the government.\n\nThis point of \"treading\" is multipurpose, as it can mean taking control of you or your rights via government and policies, or physically treading with forms of assault. Regardless the flag just means you wont let them control you without fighting back.\n\nThe problem is usually the fact that this flag get's intermingled with others that DO have political agendas attached to them. The Gadsden Flag is at its simplest, just a demonstration that you will not let someone walk over you, regardless of who it is. You will defend yourself and do what's necessary to preserve yours or your loved ones life. Not to say that this flag doesn't have a certain connotation to it; it's vary big in the gun community due to the more direct impact self defense has on a person owning their own firearm. But you do not need to own a firearm in order to relate or agree with the Gadsden flags themes\n\nhaving a police officer have that mug has a bit of a ironic feel considering the flag is used to demonstrate ones ability to defend themselves, and don't need police to defend them. These people often see the police and government that control them as the vary thing that would be \"treading on them\"\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/to4e9gnu1lfb1.png?width=1450&format=png&auto=webp&s=1322375a053c4b9447b61785e5d1a8698ccd25bb",

                "At this point the Gadsen flag and \"Don't Tread on Me\" have been captured by the right.  They use it as an identifier more than they actually follow the principles that it originally endorsed.  There is a significant persecution complex going on where racists and bigots feel oppressed from speaking their bigotry, and where the religious feel oppressed because they can't enforce their religious opinions and rules as laws for the entire country.

Blue states have throttled their housing supply, leading to dramatic price increases and spurring millions of families to relocate to red states in the Sun Belt.\"\n\nThese trends have intensified in the past few years, as conservative legislatures have passed a raft of laws restricting abortion access and targeting LGBTQ Americans and as housing shortages have spread, Lowrey continues.

While the job itself isn't that difficult, I work for 12+ hours per day and have barely any free time and no days off. Also, the town I'm working at is really small so I don't have anything to do in that little free time that I have. The boss and his family are amazing (which is the reason I want to reject them as politely as possible), but when I look at the good and bad stuff about the job the choice is clear.\n\nAnother thing I should mention here is that a few months ago, before getting this job, I sent a job request to a hotel that I really want to work at because they pay well, give me free time and aren't a private location so there aren't any annoying \"boss's friends\". Recently I got a call from this hotel and they told me to send a job request this december for the next year because they want me to work there but they couldn't squeeze me in this year.

After I paid, ewan ko, lutang siguro ako or gusto ko na lang makauwi na, I left na agad. Nasa parking na ako when I heard the cashier girl calling me, \"Ma'am, naiwan nyo yung tinapay nyo!\" The poor girl had left her post and rushed after me to give me the breads I had paid for but forgot to bring. She didn't have to do that, she could have just set the breads aside and waited for me to go back for them, but she didn't. And I was much grateful to her. I offered her a monetary tip pero she didn't accept it.",

This is not always because they're riding their D's though, it is most of the time the foreigners are the ones requiring more service as they're not fully aware of the norms in here (like where is this item, how is this item, how to, where to, etc...). Most of the time, we don't need that attention though, as we just need to buy the item we need, and get out as soon as we can.\n\nThere are of course cases of white worship, and cases of just plain bad customer service.

                "In my experience, Filipinos usually look down on service workers also so maybe thats why they aren't very nice to Filipinos.

                "There's a lot going on when it comes to being a service worker. Mainly nasa character ng tao yan pero may several factors din na kahit mabait/helpful yung tao, magiging pangit pa rin yung customer service na ma ibigay nila. \n\nimo some of these are:\n- training before ilagay sa customer facing position. Pag di ka nabigyan ng proper training edi puchu puchu lang din gagawin mo sa customer kasi wala naman na set na standard\n- processes ng isang business/industry (example refund situation: if may refund sila magkakaroon pa sila ng process na icater yung customer, if wala pwedeng utusan sila ng management na magsend nalang ng spiel kaya it will turn out rude dahil di na nila hawak yung pagserve sa customer)\n- salary (minsan may ibang mindset na hindi naman ganun kataas binabayad sa kanila to deal with some types of customers. ito rin mas malaking dahilan kaya mas mukhang matulungin ang mga ofws, para sa foreign countries/employers barya lang ang sahod natin, pero sa atin malaki na kaya todo magsatisfy ng customer, win win situation ito lalo na sa foreign company)\n\nTsaka OP yung sinabi mo na goodmorning sir/maam, its just a basic training na igreet mo customers mo, natrain sila kung paano maghandle ng mga bagay bagay, pero pag sila ay nag go for the extra mile sa pagserve sayo, dun mo malalaman kung ano ba talaga ang good customer service. \n\nAlso I work as a tech support for a foreign company, hindi na necessary ang sir/maam, mas gusto nila na tawagin sila with their given name. Narealize ko na mas narereach out mo ang customer pag kinakausap mo sila with their given name. Not sure why na embed na sa utak ng mga pilipino na mas maayos matawag ng maam/sir, sense of entitlement i guess? (Yes alam ko for respect din pero ang daming ways para ipakita ang respect hindi lang sa maam/sir) Tsaka ang nangyayari yung mga gumagamit ng maam/sir in customer service ay nilalagay lang nila sarili nila in a lower class despite trabaho naman na nila yun so in other words mas mataas pa nga dapat tingin nila sa sarili nila dahil trained and knowledgeable sila sa ginagawa nila. Ang need ay ilevel ang sarili with customers at hindi maging mas mababa ang tingin ng customers sa customer service employee dahil may times na aabusuhin ito ng ibang customer dahil once na greet sila ng maam/sir ay iisipin nila na mas mataas na sila.",
                "Totally agree. My cousins from the US pointed it out (mind you they look like your typical Pinoys so one can't say na mabait sa kanila because they look like foreigners), they really liked the fact na sinasabi ng cashier yung amount na binigay mo ex.

Also, they were surprised at how we would ask security guards for directions sa mall without any hesitation, can't say the same for other us states but sa New York daw kasi your bff is google maps and you're on your own talaga.",

I think the only difference I see is usually businesses allow us to run tabs and basically pay at the end because we're assumed to be rich and good for the bill while many make Filipinos pay as they go. Honestly, they shouldn't allow white people to run a bill because many there are indeed broke and might try to skip the bill (coming from a white person again).

It\u2019s just a normal shirt converse t shirt.

They started talking about how awesome AMLO is and he's ending with all the corruption and helping the workers and ending with the corrupt elites. \n\n.\n\nAnd then they started talking very patriotically about Mexico, Mexican identity, and Mexican immigrants, saying that this country would be nothing without the Mexicans and stuff like that. \n\n.\n\nAnd then US politics came up, and wow, these guys love trump. It was like 8 guys and all turned out to be trump supporters, they were saying we need to support Trump this november (yes, they said **this** november), and all these indictements against him are bullshit, and Democrats are ruining this country. The only specific issues they mentioned were crime, regulations (i work for a propane company), and homelessness, they werent saying how sad it is that theres homeless people but saying they hate the homeless drug addicts in our city (it is a big problem here to be fair).  And everything else was the same arguments that they used for AMLO, Trump is for the little guy and against the corrupt elites. They didnt say anything about the border or immigration when talking about Trump, and they also never mentioned Biden.\n\n.\n\n\nI obviously wasnt surprised that theres hispanic Trump supporters, i was surprised that these hispanic trump supporters just a few minutes ago were talking so positively about mexican immigrants and supporting AMLO who is part of Mexicos far left. Its that combination that threw me off. I wouldnt be surprised if we one day find ourselves in that dark future where the GOP truly becomes the party of the multi-racial working class",

So maybe your coworkers could be more sensitive, but they have a hard time assimilating how someone could be homeless in the land of plenty, especially when they're making it in the US despite their background.\n\nAlso, AMLO and Trump are both populists.

Not because you agree per se, but because you love her?",
                "Old married lady here.\n\nIt's not realistic to expect to have spectacular sex on your wedding night. You're both probably going to be exhausted. On my wedding night, we spent 40 minutes getting all of the pins out of my hair. All we both really wanted to do when the wedding was over was take off our uncomfortable clothes, shower, eat food (because we'd barely had time to eat all day) and crash. Sex was not even a thought until the next morning. This scenario is, from what I have heard from my family and friends, very very normal. \n\nThat said, what is wrong with you that you can't forego sex for a month? First of all, it's rude to insist on sex when your partner doesn't want to, regardless of whether you agree with their reason. Second, life is gonna throw all kinds of situations at you that will create gaps in your sex life. What happens when she gives birth? Or you injure your back? Or one or both of you has to take a medication that affects your libido? You aren't entitled to sex just because there's a woman in your bed. If I were her, I would see your objection as a massive red flag.\n\nShe is asking you to make a small sacrifice because she thinks it will be fun and spicy for her. Why aren't you willing to do that? Even if you are exhausted on your wedding night, you can push the sex to the next morning and it'll still be spicy for her. A month is nothing. Do you really want to spend the month leading up to your wedding having sex that she doesn't want?",

                "So this is the thing. Anyone can revoke sex at any time. It isn\u2019t something you are entitled to just because she\u2019s your fianc\u00e9. If she doesn\u2019t want to have sex for a month then she doesn\u2019t want to have sex for a month and you can be an adult and can control yourself. \nAll you can do is politely tell her that you\u2019d prefer to have sex. If she shuts that down. Then that is her choice\n\nNot to be rude but you sound immature. 4weeks without sex \u2026..you\u2019ll survive. Focus on making your bride to be happy. If that makes her happy then who cares \n\nIf she ever gets pregnant you\u2019ll have to stop sex for weeks after while she\u2019s healing. So grow up and realize that no one owes you sex. You can use your hand for 4weeks.",

It was never to have fun, to play, to try new things. It was just a way for him to get an orgasm. Maybe she\u2019s trying to build tension to maybe bring some spice back into the bedroom? \n\nMaybe your questions should be \u201chow is she so ok with going a whole month without sex when I feel like I can\u2019t? Is there something I\u2019m not doing to make her want it more?\u201d But of course not. It\u2019s just about how you couldn\u2019t possibly go a single month without sex. Grow up for real.",
                "The wife asked for the same thing.  I agreed because it\u2019s not that big of a deal.  And\u2026 it didn\u2019t work out because the idea of it turned her on enough that she kept giving in because she was too horny.",
                "It sounds like you will need to work on your self-soothing methods if sex is your biggest stress reliever. Each member of a couple, especially if you\u2019re planning to get married, should be able to handle their emotions on their own without the aid of their partner. Not because you\u2019re not supposed to help your partner (you should of course!), but in situations where your partner cannot help you (travel, illness, trauma, etc.) you will need to be able to be a functional human being.\n\nAnyways, I can\u2019t say what your fianc\u00e9e is thinking but I will tell you that when I was dating my ex, whenever he would get upset over me turning down sex it made me want to have sex with him less. It got to the point I stopped fucking him entirely because he was always trying to push or guilt me into things I didn\u2019t want to do. When I started dating someone new and they showed they clearly respected my boundaries and consent, it made me more comfortable having more sex.",

I am not at all saying her reasoning makes sense to me but you guys are about to get married and y\u2019all are on different pages about sex already and it kind of sounds like you think you are entitled to sex? Enthusiastic Consent still matters married, engaged or just met. If she truly feels this way then you could be running into obligation sex which is no way to start a marriage. Y\u2019all need to talk this out with a professional.",
                "Oof lucky lady marrying someone who just can't cope with a month without sex lmaooo",
                "Look, people need to figure out what does and doesn't work for them but some of you guys are incredibly pessimistic about how this will work out if you go through with it. My husband and I literallh had sex for the first time on our wedding night *and* limited the stuff we did for a few weeks before the wedding. It was like 1 AM and we were exhausted. We still had great sex and remember it as incredibly meaningful. Sure, the first round didn't exactly last for an hour but that's why second rounds are a thing.\n\nAlso the idea that since she wants this, this is 'what married life is going to be like' is ridiculous. Who knows, maybe it will! But the fact that someone is willing to forego sex for a month to build up tension is not a red flag than they're going to withhold sex from now on. \n\nI get why you're not so into the idea, but the way you're talking about it is far more condescending than warranted. Having some build-up beforehand can definitely make it feel extra special and exciting and if for her that's the case, is that really such a problem? It's just a month? Sure, it might be coming out of old-fashioned notions or idealistic expectations, but if its meaningful to her you should at the very least be willing to take her request seriously.",
                "I want to first fully agree with you that fucking on a wedding night is generally nowhere as ideal as people want to think it is. You are 1000% spot on. Also, it sets up some really risky expectations for both of you, especially when weddings are already stressful enough. The last thing I would want to have to worry about is whether or not our wedding night lives up to a month of experimental celibacy. That just seems like a recipe for frustration and resentment and disappointment, none of which anyone would want to feel on their wedding night.\n\nI really don\u2019t want to rag on your fianc\u00e9 here because the sentiment is sweet even if it\u2019s misguided. However, this idea feels like \u201cI read something in a magazine, and it sounded cool, but I haven\u2019t actually applied real thinking behind what this would look like in reality\u201c.\n\nSo, in your shoes, I would have a very adult conversation with her and say \u201cwhile I find this sentiment to be sweet, this is not going to work for me. I want to be able to feel intimate and connected with you in the weeks leading up to what will be a very stressful and chaotic situation, even under the best of circumstances. Being able to sustain our intimacy through that is important to me, especially because, realistically, we might be exhausted at the end of our wedding day, and I can\u2019t imagine anything less romantic or less sexy, then forcing ourselves to have sex when it\u2019s quite possible neither of us is really going to be in the mood for it.\u201c\n\nI might also add something like this: \u201cthey were going to be times in our life together where sex may not be as frequent as either of us would like because of life circumstances: health, work, kids, whatever. I hope we can deal with those dry spells with compassion and understanding. But knowing those unpredictable bouts of celibacy are out there in the future, I don\u2019t want to start the lead up to our married life by agreeing to be celibate for a reason that I personally don\u2019t believe in. I think it\u2019s such a bad precedent for how we approach sex in our relationship.\u201c\n\nAll of this feels very reasonable to for you to say. And hopefully, your fianc\u00e9 isn\u2019t so wed to this idea that it\u2019s going to cause a blowup, but if it is\u2026 and I don\u2019t think it will\u2026 better that it happens before the wedding then after , you know what I\u2019m saying?",

Instead you've decided that it's stupid and childish and that you can't deal with not fucking for the purpose of \"stress relief\" for just a month.\n\nIdk, this post just gives off red flags to me. On the one hand, it's perfectly fine to not be into the idea. But on the other hand, the way you talk about it makes it seem like you haven't even tried to understand why this is something she wants and like you're selfishly putting your preference for sex over masturbation above something that is important to her for a very special event in both your lives. Especially with how busy you are preparing for the wedding, a month is going to go by so fast.

My wife was as well, as she spent a lot of time doing set up stuff.  \n\n\nAnyways, my point is, when we went back to our room after the reception, we had some amazing sex. Seriously some of the best we've ever had. We were both so horny for each other and it had that extra special meaning to it too. So don't go into this thinking you won't get a special night. You will.   \n\n\nAlso, I found out later on that my wife (who is almost always open for sex) was so tired she actually wanted to just go to bed and she knew I was too but was very pleasantly surprised at me making the first move despite how tired we both were and knew the other was too.

And if they do have sex it's going to last 10 seconds due to not having sex for a month leading up to it and possibly being tired after the wedding meaning disappointment on her part because she's got this idea that the month refraining from sex is going to make the night amazing. Thats a lot of pressure to put on her soon to be husband",

You're exhausted after such a long day. We ended up taking a 3 day break from sex after our wedding---night before, night of, day after because I was so tired and sore from my dress and all the work thay went into it.\n\n So personally, I don't see the point in stopping prior to the wedding since you're most likely not doing it on your wedding night, but if your fiance does then I don't see the harm in respecting what they want. It doesn't seem like a red flag that they're requesting it imo",

Maybe it's because I'm an older dude and because I've had to travel a lot and have had several month long interruptions in sex with a long term partner, but it isn't all that hard.  \n\n\nSure, making love to your girlfriend of wife is better than masturbating, but it's not a huge deal overall. If your needs are so strong that 30 days is a crisis, you're going to have some trouble during other times in your life. Take it as training. Develop your willpower brother. You'll be better off for it. When you have kids or your wife is pregnant (sometimes you can, but not all pregnancies are the same), this time of control will help you be prepared and stay level.  \n\n\nHowever, I agree the unilateral stopping is strange. You did not specify but you both seem young, if so, I recommend more communication and an understanding that there are more important things in a relationship than keeping sex going at all costs. \n\nShe may be even more stressed than yourself, some women shut down completely under a lot of stress. She may be expressing that in a strange way, who knows. Talk about it but be kind to her. Maybe women really enjoy this time of their lives and have weird wishes and expectations about it. Play along, she may repay your patience and understanding down then line.\n\nYou could also be a trickster. If you are fit and young maybe you can unilaterally sleep naked all month and slowly oil yourself, to moisturize of course, before sleep hahahaha. This is what I would have done, maybe even work out in front of her and talk about the importance of stoicism and the need to retain your manly energy in order to become a greater man and warrior.

Then likely another 20% increase right as we are heading to the election. And I won't be alone. Nothing Labor is doing will stop that happening. Absolutely nothing. \n\nAnd we won't be alone. A third of Australians will be going to the polls in a couple of years after even further financial stress, homelessness, having to move into share housing, delaying families, adult kids unable to launch. This is the next two years now that Labor has decided to do nothing for renters. They will be decimated.",

Bihar is making progress, Delhi has topped the metro rail network whereas Kolkata had stayed the same for so many years until a few years ago at least. The bus network is so pathetic. Private buses have taken over completely leaving no room for state buses which means more corruption. Kolkata is making no progress or its very slow but at this rate, the cities in India that were deemed to be once upon a time underdeveloped cities of India, will make some good amount of progress and break the barriers while Kolkata will stay the same and we'll still boast about Howrah bridge and us introducing the first metro rail.",

Perhaps because on some level it makes us feel superior.\n\nWhen a conservative says 'I am pro life'. Rather than considering the complex ethical, philosophical and scientific basis for their belief. The difficult questions about when life starts, and when human rights begin. People often jump to the knee jerk assumption that they are mysoginists or religious zealots purely driven by a will to control women.\n\nWhenever a liberal says 'we should strive to be anti racist in policy making''. The knee jerk reaction is to assume they are anti-western, 'woke' or other derisive terms. Rather than assuming the more charitable reading that they are just looking at historical injustices that are still engrained in some areas of policy.\n\nEven when people express a clear and logical argument for their beliefs. The charge is often levied that they are just 'dog whistling' to mask their secret communist/fascist beliefs.\n\nWhy do we allow this thinking to drive a wedge between people?\n\nWhy don't we start as a baseline that, unless they have directly expressed otherwise, we steel man arguments rather than straw man them.\n\nIf we truly believe in our causes, surely that shouldn't be a frightening prospect.

I know that a concept of what is considered polite in Poland and England is a bit different. I did tell this to my Scottish (in Poland) husband and he said it is rubbish and not something people would really do. But ... this was England not Scotland plus my hubby lives in Poland for over a decade now and we got him corrupted so ... \n\nThe story is: Polish guy living in England got in \"trouble\" with his English girlfriend. The issue was that when they were eating something he said to her \"Pass me the salt, please.\" That would a prefectly fine sentence in Poland and considered polite. She told him that it was rude as it was a direct request. It made him sound passive-agressive. Apparently he should have asked \"Could you pass me the salt?\". Questions are more polite than requests even if those are followed by \"please\". \n\nCould you polite people be so kind and express you expert opinion on this? \n\nIf you don't mind, I would be very thankful for your insight.\n\nEdit: Wow! So many answers ! Thanks a lot guys, you are very helpful! I get from this that while generally ok, it is better to fraze such things as questions. I will remember this for the future. \n\nFor those questioning if that really happened, I have no option to validate it. I was told a story that made me curious. I  did not mean anything wrong by it.

This can be a challenge for people who are learning English as a second language, as their native language may have a different way of expressing requests.\n\nFor example, in Dari, it is common to say \"we go to town\" instead of \"could you take me to town?\". This can be confusing for English speakers, who may interpret it as a command rather than a request.\n\nTo make a request in English, you can use the phrase \"could you\" before the verb. For example, you could say \"could you take me to town?\" or \"I'm wondering whether you could take me to town?\". These phrases are more polite than simply saying \"take me to town\", and they are more likely to be understood by English speakers.",
                "I don't think its rude. My partner and I (both English) would probaby phrase it, \"Pass me the salt. Now.\". Direct and assertive. But yeah, when interacting with strangers we ask using the expected overtly frilly nonesense.",

Adding please does make it more polite, but at the end of the day its still an order. Most people wouldn't be bothered by it, but some are.\n\n\"Could you pass me the salt?\" Is a question. That makes it a request, which the other person can decline. A \"please\" can be added, but even without it asking if someone *could* do something is more polite than telling them to do it. \n\nFor the sake of grammar \"Please could you pass me the salt?\", \"Could you please pass me the salt?\" And \"Could you pass me the salt, please?\" are all correct, though the latter is a bit more informal.",

While it's normally not going to be a problem, you will absolutely run into people getting their backs up about requests being phrased this way when tensions are already high (e.g. at work or during a disagreement).\n\nBy the way, the reason for this is fairly straightforward to explain: \"Pass the salt\" uses the imperative mood, i.e. the sentence is a command, which implies you have some authority over the other person.",

                "Linguistic politeness is actually an area of linguistic pragmatics. I only have very casual knowledge of this area of study, but to simplify, English speakers use mostly conventionally indirect strategies when making requests, and the more distant the relationship between the interlocutors, the more indirect the request is. In some other languages (like Polish) requests become more direct as the relationship becomes closer. This means different layers of politeness with let\u2019s say, casual acquaintances or colleagues compared to family members and close friends. That\u2019s why the English think of themselves as polite and many other nationalities as not, but it\u2019s normally not that the foreigners are rude, they just use their native language politeness strategies when communicating in a foreign language, which sounds crude to English ears.",

I'm just letting some fresh air in.\"\n\nThis is considered much more polite than the following:\n\n- \"Nigel, close the window, please.\"\n- \"No, Mavis, I'm letting some fresh air in.\".\n\nIn the first example, the exchange comes across like both parties are embarrassed to intrude upon other, meaning that the disagreement (over closing the window) is downplayed almost to nothing; no *explicit* instruction is issued, and no *explicit* refusal is returned. However, in the second example, the same dispute comes across as much more blunt and hostile, as if there is about to be a loud argument over whether or not the window ought to be closed. This is socially unacceptable - especially in company. \n\nTo us Brits, the second scenario may as well sound like this:\n\n- \"Nigel, close that window NOW!\"\n- \"Fuck you, Mavis! I'm letting some fresh air in!\"\n\nAs you can imagine, the addition of the word \"please\" to the end of Mavis' instruction does not make it sound any more polite. This is similar to how \"Pass the salt, please.\" might sound a little like \"Pass the salt NOW.\", even if that's not how you intended it.\n\nWe Brits are a funny lot, and we hate nothing more in polite conversation than confrontation. We go to any lengths to avoid it at the dinner table. I hope you understand our pathological politeness a little better now. :D",

My husband didn't just walk past him, or even just said \"No, sorry\", no, my man held a (what felt like) five minute monologue on why he didn't have money on him and that he was very sorry about it and what not. \n\nI had never seen someone use so many words before to simply say (essentially) \"no\". Our English teachers had always taught us, that it was considered impolite in England to just say yes or no but rather that you had to say things like \"Yes, I do\", \"No, I don't\" (stuff like that, rather than just a one-worded answer). But it was in that moment that I realized, I'd always be considered rude in that country.

                "We cannot make the transition from a non-meritocracy where things like race and gender matter a great deal to a utopian meritocracy where they don't matter at all without making intentional efforts to rectify imbalances created by the legacy system. \n\n>This is what MLK was fighting against: \"...Not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.\" \n\nThere it is. The only MLK quote conservatives know.",
                "I think there are two ways to justify this.\n\nThe first is to consider that by putting someone into a position that has not previously been filled by a person who is of the same group, you signal to other people in that group that it is possible for them to achieve. Seeing the example of someone like them succeeding will motivate people to get involved in government and to improve their skills. \n\nAnd if all the candidates are pretty equally competent, then the candidate who can also instill in the public a sense that the country is moving past its racist heritage is a bonus.\n\nTo me, if I consider all the people who could benefit from seeing positive role models, that outnumbers the number of white guys who will be disappointed that they're not seeing as many white guys as they're used to. I'm a white guy, and it doesn't bother me to see jobs taken by folks who aren't white guys.\n\n---\n\nThe more esoteric argument is a matter of time horizon perspective.\n\nImagine there's a room full of all the people who held a given government role in the past 250 years. You'd have likely something like 95% white men.\n\nIf you looked at each point in history and gathered all of the qualified candidates for that role, society was not showing people who weren't white men that they could get that role for most of history, so we had relatively few people pursuing the skills that would make them qualified. As time went on, more people pursued those positions, but they still predominantly went to white men.\n\nIf you compare the total pool of qualified candidates over 250 years to the actual people who help the office, you would see that there is a skew.\n\nNow imagine we hop forward another 250 years, and look at all the people who hold the position, and compare that with all the people who are qualified.\n\nWhat's more important? Making the fairest choice in the moment, or considering the long now and making a choice that in the wholeness of history is fairest? If we look at the next 250 years and there are no white men, is that biased? If we expand our view to see ALL 500 YEARS, and the pool ends up about half men, half women, and made up of diverse races, does that mean that there wasn't bias?\n\nHow wide of a time horizon do we want to consider when we're judging a culture?",

That wasn't at all how he thought that would be achieved and in fact he later went back a bit on the content of that speech, stating that it was perhaps a bit overambitious. \n\nPoint being: Yes, The goal is to be in a society where one isn't judged for the colour of their skin, but that's not the Society we are in now and we are not close to getting their either. We can't solve this issue by ignoring it, we have to actively engage with it. Explore the problems, the interests and opinions of the minorities that are being suppressed by the system right now. Making sure that someone from that minority gets a place at the high table can be a way to ensure that the minority voices don't go unheard, it can also be a way to restore trust in the system. Normalising people of colour in important positions is an important step. I can't say if this is necessarily the right way to do it, this is just to explain how I can see it be rationalised.\n\nAnother thing to note here is that the whole \"chosing based on merits\" thing runs into a bit of an issue with systemic racism too. As the system and socioeconomic circumstances make it significantly harder for minority to develop and show their merits and the still deeply ingrained prejudice in society can often overshadow their merits too. Basically, If you have two people, one white and one black, the black person is statistically significantly more likely to grow up in poverty, to attend a lower quality school, to be discouraged from aiming for academic achievement, will face increased scrutiny in many situations and will have to put in extra effort to overcome these disadvantages and to overcome the prejudices present in society. \n\nIt's these sort of things that measures like Affirmative action are intended to offset. Affirmative action alone won't solve racism, it's a flawed solution for an extremely complex and wide reaching problem that can only be solved by similarly complex and wide reaching changes. But that's the basic motivation behind it: Black people face disadvantages outside their control, so let's artificially offset these disadvantages to bring black people up to statistical equality. \n\nAnd once you have that, you open up more avenues to escape poverty, you normalise black people in high positions, you enable them more avenues to bring attention to the unique challenges faced by their community, and so on.\n\nIt's a good idea in theory. In practice, for every such measure, there are several factors that work to avoid the larger societal changes and measures to lift up disadvantaged communities are often extremely limited and lack the necessary long term committent. So overall, progress is extremely slow.\n\nI always liken the situation in the US to overlapping band-aids. Each band-aid is only a temporary measure to somewhat mitigate the injury. But for it to heal it needs a proper bandage and applying that may require ripping off the band-aids first, even if that's very painful for a bit. Doing something like Affirmative action without the necessary societal changes to address the underlying cause is just adding another band-aid on the festering infected wound that is the US history of white supremacy and slavery.",

Always love when I make a post that gets enough people mad that it creates waves of drama.\n\nMight as well clarify my points here since it got very lost in the sea of people offering \"so what you're saying is...\" misinterpretations:\n\nJust because the British settlers were the \"first\" ones there (which isn't even technically true; it was originally a French colony, but w/e) doesn't mean that it's appropriate to try and label them as \"indigenous\" to the islands. That word has a far more nuanced meaning that cannot be wholly divorced from its historical and cultural context. Critically, when discussing the Americas, the word has always been used to differentiate the pre-Columbian populations from those who came over from the \"old world\". In fact it's through that context that the term \"indigenous people\" even came about in the 1600s. It is then incredibly inappropriate to claim that term for the settlers who were part of that same imperialist colonial project of which the indigenous people were victims. There are innumerable academic, historic, and official documents which explicitly state that there are no \"native\" or \"indigenous\" people of the Falkland islands, including the British Falkland government itself.\n\nEdit: huh, when I went to bed last night this comment was in the positives, but then I guess the British took over the thread while Americans slept and were just a unhappy here as they were there. They're even using the same arguments of \"anyone who was there first just be considered both native and indigenous, regardless of all other factors\" despite that never having been the definitions of those words in this context. You will never find a single source identifying the British settlers on the Falklands as \"indigenous\" because aside from the redditors who are now super pissed at me, no one would be so obtuse as to claim that that word applies here.",

                "He is not particularly bright, so I doubt he has the mental capacity to strategize on a global scale. He is not even able to run Twitter with any degree of success. He is so deep in Dunning-Kruger land that it is almost embarrassing to watch.",
                "because he's a dipshit whose highest aspiration seems to be a mildly successful standup comedian.",
                "Because his money is not real. Tesla is probably worth 1/5 of its current evaluation (at best) and he is aware of that. This is why he used his Tesla stock to get a loan to buy Twitter. If I am not mistaken he now has the second biggest private debt in the world. Just think about it, in his eyes Twitter is more valuable than Tesla. This is one of the few things I agree with Musk on.",
                "He's not smart, he's not even the richest anymore (from what I've read), and he's an overgrown toddler who pays people to pretend to like him and throws a tantrum with poop emojis if they won't play along lol.\nHe shouldn't have power over literally ANYTHING.\nBut, America gives power to evil, stupid people...so, give it time. \ud83d\ude1c",
                "But he is manipulating world events, thru his communications satellite network. For instance, he refuses to let Ukraine use it, thus favoring Russia. And that's just one thing he's doing that we know about",
                "I don't agree with others comments here , he is manipulating world politics like all rich do: It's just normal rich person bullshit. From his obscenely low tax rate, to getting away with shit like the boring company and we can go on forever about the environmental impact he gets away with. It's all relatively mundane for a rich person and kinda expected. \n\nWith Musk's wealth you expect much more manipulation and change. The fact is Musk isn't smart or brave enough to do such evil, he has fallen upwards his entire life and his success is thanks to everyone else under him contributing and directing him in life. Even Twitter he was pushed to buy by sycophants including his ex wife and the only reason he is going out of his way to control it is for he is addicted to it and after being forced to buy it, sunk cost fallacy. Sure, he suppresses whistle blowers and highlights alt right garbage on the platform but that's all relatively mundane for the world's richest man when he was forced to buy the platform. Evil yes, but very unimaginative and underachieving for the influence and power he could posses with his fuck you money. Look at Zuckerberg for how evil you can be just with social media.\n\nElon doesn't realize the influence he could really have on global politics and when he does try beyond standard evil rich person destroying the environment and not paying taxes, he fails miserably: He is still trying to prove he is right about the vaccine. His support of DeSantis didn't help at all. He didn't even vote during the midterms when he said people should vote Republican. \n\nHe's at best just another right wing misinfo machine, sure with a bigger outreach than all, but it's still pretty tame to how much damage he could do if he had above average intelligence and twitter didn't destroy his attention span.",
                "Your premise is wrong. Notice during the World Cup whose ring he was kissing... I mean, I didn't notice exactly. I think it was some sheikh or something. But he's the richest man in the world *on paper*. Oil sheiks and dictators don't have to submit their W2's to Forbes magazine or disclose their shares. I think the richest man in the world might be Putin. \n\nBut I agree, the way to influence policy is to buy politicians, fund think tanks, and hothouse talking heads like Ben Shapiro. That's well within his grasp, I think.",
                "Actually Musk has dropped to second richest behind Bernard Arnault **because** of his dumb shit with Twitter and having to sell off so many Tesla shares to keep the platform afloat, which tanked Tesla's stock value by half. **That** is why he does not have his finger on the pulse of world politics...because the man can barely manage to do something as simple as run an *already fully established* social media site on his own.  \n\n\n**Every one** of Musk's companies outside of Twitter have always been run by people other than him. Hell, Tesla wasn't even his company to begin with. It was established by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning in 2003 and then Elon came in, bought up most of the shares, and said 'okay this is mine now' and took over. Then he got bored of it, handed it to a board of directors, and went to find something else to get him attention. Just like SpaceX and Starlink. Just handed them off to other people to take care of once he was no longer in the news for it. Twitter's absolute crash in popularity and brand value since he's acquired it is proof that he is *not* a business genius like his diehard fans think he is and *cannot* manage things when left his to own devices. He is **not** some sort of business savant, he is just a very rich man who has no moral reservations about taking credit for others work.",
                "Once you get into the billions, your economic power is a little less cut and dry than simply your net worth. Whilst on paper musk is the richest person on the planet, realistically speaking he could never get anything close to the 250 billion or so dollars he 'has' in a liquid asset.\n\nFor example, sombody like Muhammed bin salman is in another league to musk entirely when it comes to economic power.",
                "What are you talking about? \n\nElon can't stand up to peer review scrutiny, he would never be able to manipulate a politician.",
                "He\u2019s masturbating his ego in public and he\u2019s very addicted to it.",
                "In one word? Insecurity. I listened to a podcast that extensively covered the Twitter acquisition and it provides a great insight into Elon's genius.\n\nHe's surrounded by yes men and by that I don't mean employees that don't wanna lose their job; Its fellow tech billionaires that kind of worship him. These dudes are exactly like the bluechecks that pump him up. While we're seeing backlash in the public for his controversial moves, he's really praised in these circles.\n\nThe entire acquisition effort began because his ex-wife( actress Talulah Riley) hated that Twitter took down a transphobic tweet. To impress her, Elon decided to acquire Twitter. His moves are mostly impulsive, to impress people in his circles.\n\nThat being said, he also knows they are vultures. They're only in it for the money. Public adoration though? That's like a drug. He was always edgy but understood the right wing resurgence and took the opportunity to be as loud as possible.",
                "Kompromat - he's not only a Lolita express flyer, but probably beholden to Russian intelligence. \n\nHis pattern of behavior is consistent with other known and suspected assets of the Kremlin - especially with the blatant alt-right re-orientation of Twitter, which he probably purchased under pressure of blackmail. \n\nThe guy flashes his dick to flight attendants - it's very likely he's fallen for various honeypots in the past, of a nature too vulgar to let come out.",
                "I'm pretty sure he thinks jerking around on twitter is manipulating world politics.\n\nThink of all the major events that twitter has been instrumental in. Over the last 17 years it became embedded in social and political life all over the world. It played a major part in everything from the Arab Spring to the rise of modern western fascism.\n\nIntelligent, subtle manipulation of twitter could be incredibly influential.\n\nBut Muskrat is neither intelligent nor subtle. Especially when it comes to understanding how humans work. But he thinks he's a genius who knows everything. So he thinks he's playing 5-dimensional chess, when all he's doing is flipping the game board and lighting it on fire.\n\nWhich I guess is a kind of influence, in its own way. We won't have Twitter to use for the next Arab Spring or similar movements. But he seems happy to let \"X\" become the guarded haven of fascists. That's going to shape how the world works in the future.",
                "Twitter was a place where we could find out the public\u2019s opinions on things somewhat fairly and safely. Now we don\u2019t have that anymore. \n\nIt\u2019s working just as planned.",
                "I mostly think musk is an idiot....but tanking Twitter would be a smart way to ratfuck politics....it was one of the few places people got info/communicated. Like it could be a powerful tool for unionizing.",
                "He is though. He stopped Ukraine from attacking Russia's troops at least once. That's what we know, so there are probably more instances.\n\nNo one man should have the power he currently has. Period.",
                "Wait, what are you talking about? Isn\u2019t he manipulating world politics by buying Twitter, the world\u2019s leading social media platform on world politics?",

                "The one the he has always wanted was to be seen a \u201ccool guy\u201d by other \u201ccool guys.\u201d\n\nEverything he does makes sense when you look at it like this.",
                "He has so much wealth and power but the mentality of a 13 year old trust fund baby.\n\nThat being said, he *is* using his influence on behalf of right-wing causes, ranging from reinstating the artist formerly known as Kanye West to his platform to using Starlink as a leverage tool against Ukraine in its struggle for sovereignty.",

                "He is don\u2019t you get it? He\u2019s using Twitter to spread misinformation he wants and alienate the truth from a majority of the users on his platform to influence events of the century.",
                "I think you miss how critical Twitter was for disseminating news about what the last fascist administration was up to in their attempts to take over the many institutions that make up the government. \n\nNow it's a site for pedophile Nazis to share memes. \n\nIn the 2024 Election it will be a firehose of fascist disinformation, and if they win that one it's all over. \n\nI'd say that is the power to manipulate world politics.",
                "It seems to be a combination of autism and affluenza. He's a man who's convinced himself that any random impulse or hyperfixation that crosses his mind is actually a stroke of business genius, and has enough money that there are virtually no barriers between his thoughts and actions.",

Just that is already an evil supervillain operation, with incredible technical and geopolitical implications. And he's all day on xitter being dull, racist and moronic.

It\u2019s the unofficial people who don\u2019t want their wealth to be made public and are quite happy not appearing on the Forbes rich list that actually run the world.\n\nThe house of Saud or \u201cthe Saudi Clan\u201d has a net worth of 1.4 trillion.\n\nIt\u2019s the Saudi\u2019s that essentially bought Twitter. So you could say that Elon is very much their puppet.",

                ">You\u2019d think he would be running world politics or buying countries\n\nMusk isn't doing either of these things because these things cannot be done. It doesn't matter how rich you are. \"Running world politics\" actually made me snort Coke Zero out of my nose. *Nobody* \"runs\" world politics. Nobody \"owns\" countries. People *influence* world politics, sure; and people try to *influence* politicians (seldom with any guarantee of success).\n\nBut the idea that these things are \"run\" or \"bought\" by single actors is a cartoonish idea that, sadly, is often used to manipulate people like you into voting for the sort of candidates who promise to *change* this. Of course, the con job is that there is nothing to change: there is no cabal of global elites who control everything; no Freemasons or Rothschilds; corporations, powerful and influential as they are, do not \"own\" the governments of states in any sense, popular as this idea is among a general public that often hasn't studied basic civics, much less international politics.\n\nNobody \"runs\" world politics because world politics is far too complex a game for any single actor to hold a monopoly of power over. Managing a local mayoral election often proves too complex for even the most well-funded and politically powerful candidate to predict or to navigate with anything approaching certainty. But you're talking about *the world*: an arena of 195-odd state actors equipped with militaries, weapons of war, and millions (if not billions) of unpredictable citizens. World politics is too complex for events to be predicted even *approximately* \\-- absolutely no one is capable of controlling it, least of all because (even if someone *were* capable of doing so) there would then come millions of actors vying for the right to do so: and this in and of itself would prove too complex a process to ever be reduced to \"x runs the world.\"\n\nA state is defined as an entity that possesses a monopoly of violence over a given territory and a given number of people who live within that territory. If the state no longer has a *monopoly* on violence or control, it ceases to be a state. By definition, no state on earth has ceded its power to a single rich person, or even to a cabal of very rich people -- states are very powerful and the people who rise to power within the state tend not to give that power away without a fight, not even for money. Why would they? For one thing, power is far more valuable than money: power is the thing itself. Money is often just a means to power. But for another thing: a powerful dictator commands all the resources of the state and can enrich himself at will. He doesn't need outside funding. A leader who isn't a dictator needs to stand for elections, and electorates tend to notice when that leader is 100% bought and paid for.\n\nSo, no: Musk couldn't run world politics or buy a country, not even with all his wealth. The fact that he and Bezos and Gates and Branson and any number of other billionaires occupy their time with silly shit like throwing themselves into space and running social media companies into the ground should put the lie to the fact that this is even *possible:* running the world would, you'd think, be a pretty time-consuming activity. Between managing their own money, splashing that money around, publicity stunts, and constant self-promotion, what billionaire could find the time -- if such a thing were even possible?\n\nBut it isn't. You've been convinced that it's possible because this has become the lazy consensus talking point that online spaces -- always favoring the simple, attention-grabbing narrative over the complex truth -- have converged around.

One which requires routine service visits.\n\nWe picked up a new customer this year, female mid-30s. I am the business owner, a male in my late 30s. Every time I went to her property for a service visit she was way too friendly and flirty. She repeatedly invited me over to her place. Kept telling me that she is lonely, isn't married, needs friends, would really like it if I come over on my personal time, etc. Two times when she knew I was stopping out she wore questionable clothing, way too revealing.\n\nI was always polite and courteous and we provided her with excellent service. Though I never took her up on her offers. I don't mix business with pleasure.\n\nAnyhow, at the the second to last service visit she again asked me to come over on a weekend to have a drink with her. I told her while I enjoy talking to her while at her property, I believe that it is inappropriate for me to pursue a relationship of any sort with a customer. She started acting upset and cut the conversation off quickly.\n\nUp to that point she was thoroughly satisfied with our service. After getting rejected, she starting emailing us frequently with random complaints about the service. The complaints were so far fetched if someone heard them they would think she is insane.\n\nAbout a week after that she terminated services and posted a negative review online. She said we offer terrible service.\n\nHow does one even respond to this type of false complaint? She is just angry that I rejected her advances, but decided to take it out on my business. Should I threaten her with legal action? Bring up the truth of what happened?\n\nI fear if I reply to the review what happened honestly  customers will think I am some playboy trying to bang his customers or some type of weirdo that thinks all of his female customers want to smash.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

            "selftext": "Action movie productions involving the military or spies often have ex-special forces people advising them on how the people these movies/shows are depicting are supposed to behave (see e.g. Sicario, Black Hawk Down, Zero Dark Thirty, American Sniper), so that at least it\u2019s not so far from reality that it disrupts the suspension of disbelief.\n\nMarvel screenwriters really need consultants on how world politics works, because right now it\u2019s hard to watch. Lots of the mistakes are so rudimentary that the lines are either written by 5-year-olds or with 5-year-olds as the target audience. At the end of FATWS, Cap gave that cringe speech chastising members of the GRC, and said something like \u201cyou control all the banks, so can\u2019t you do XYZ\u201d to the lady who I suppose is maybe the head of the World Bank or something similar. Well no, nobody just controls all the banks in the world, not even as a figure of speech of exaggeration. It\u2019d be so much better if the language was toned down just a bit to \u201cyou\u2019re the head of the World Bank, I\u2019m sure you can do more to lend to countries struggling with refugees.\u201d\n\nSame with the skrull council scene in Secret Invasion a few weeks ago. One of the guys there said \u201cI\u2019m the commander of NATO, I can mobilize a million soldiers in a week\u201d or something. That means he\u2019s either replaced NATO\u2019s Secretary General (Stoltenberg\u2019s role), or SACEUR (Supreme Allied Commander Europe), neither of whom can just unilaterally mobilize other countries\u2019 soldiers. Again, it\u2019s not even something that\u2019s plausible as a figure of speech.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a glaring issue before because \u201creal world\u201d politics rarely entered the MCU; even CAWS only involved fictional entities like SHIELD and the world security council. In Iron Man, POTUS and VP were more symbols than real people. It\u2019s very different now and the lack of real understanding of just basic IR among the writers shows.\n\nEDIT: just wanted to globally respond to comments along the lines of \u201cthis is a different universe\u201d \u201cit\u2019s gotta be different with aliens and supers\u201d. Like yes to an extent that is very true. I\u2019m not picking a bone with how SHIELD, the World Security Council, SABER, or the Global Repatriation Council exist. But if the show\u2019s going to tell us about NATO, then that should bear some resemblance to the NATO we know, or else that reference doesn\u2019t mean anything at all. Or when the show references global finance (e.g. \u201ccontrol all the banks\u201d), at least have some resemblance of how real world global finance works, please. If we as the audience lose all reference points to reality, then we won\u2019t be able to follow the show when it attempts to reference reality. It\u2019s that simple.",

                "Lefty women are funny because, inspite of all their talk of toxic masculinity and insisting most men only date unrealistically pretty women, they themselves have unrealistic standards when it comes to dating.  They usually have a laundry list of desires that translate into an extreme minority of men - recurring elements usually being that they must be at least 6 feet tall (anything less is \"short\"), must make six figures, own a car, a house, and be fit.  Anything less is \"settling\" for them.\n\nThey go and date these men almost exclusively -- and because they only ever date these kinds of men, they assume most men are like this.  They assume most men make six figures, that most men are fit and tall, which goes to show you how completely detached they are from men entirely -- as if they don't even register all the men they see who aren't those things.\n\nAnd of course, because so many women want this kind of man, those guys - who make up maybe 1% of the dating pool - don't have a lot of competition.  This, in turn, likely results in too many of these kinds of guys being extremely shallow.  So, when women are dating these men to the exclusion of all others, it comes as no surprise they would project the failings of those men on all others.\n\nAnd yet, when faced with the prospect of dating a guy who is only 5'9, makes $20,000 a year, is still paying the lease on his car, and lives in an apartment, they balk like you're asking them to marry Count Orlok from Nosferatu.  These women are actually confused - CONFUSED - about why a woman would date anyone who is \"lesser\".  They are so shallow that the idea of loving a man for reasons other than his height, wealth, and fitness is absolutely alien to them.\n\nMost men, by contrast, are happy to date a woman who makes him feel fulfilled.  Someone who loves him, who he can make himself vulnerable around without being ridiculed for it, someone who can make him feel appreciated.  Those men never get respect, because unfortunately, too few of them are over 6 feet tall and making six figures annually -- and many who are likely end up with someone who doesn't really love them and end up becoming cold and bitter as a result.\n\nShallow women seek shallow men, and then wonder why those men are shallow.",

Who decided, again--and how--that everyone is now socially or morally required to wear a mask when they aren't feeling well (pandemic or no)?\n\nNever mind the point you are trying to make with *this* post, which is that telling people that mask mandates are somehow still de facto in place if you are sick does *not* have a \"political advocacy\" to it. Given that everything to do with telling people they should or should not wear masks for the last three years has been nothing *but* political, the facepalm is from everyone here thinking otherwise. We do not live in Japan, where it is a strong social norm, but the US, where it is not whatsoever. Nothing has changed, I promise you, despite whatever *you* may have inferred from the pandemic. Mods are often idiots, and I have no opinion on this guy's decision, but come on, people, this isn't rocket science.

For example near me is a four lane section that says \"Slower Traffic Keep Right\" but if you are going the posted speed limit you are not technically slower and if you ride along in the left lane you won't get stopped unless you are impeding traffic flow by going slower then the posted limit.  \n\nHowever the idiot drivers interpret this sign as \"speeders go in the left, law abiding drivers keep to the right\" and so inevitably you will go to the left lane to get around a slower vehicle and ZOOM up comes some idiot doing 20 over the posted limit on your rear end and they start honking and waving and going nuts because they can't get around you and maintain their speeding.  \n\nThen also in the same state a little farther away from me is another four lane section of highway where the signs say \"Left Lane Passing Only\" and \"Keep Right\", so of course the speeders zoom in and out of the left and right lanes bobbing and weaving to maintain their speed well over the posted limit.\n\nIn my state the speeds are more then sufficient, with most major highways now being 60mph, and expressways being 65mph, and interstate is 70mph, secondary roads are still 55mph.  Why people feel they need to do 80mph in a 60mph zone is beyond me but hey its your funeral when you crash so there's that.\n\nAn example of these laws is when i was driving in the left lane for a while, got behind traffic moving slow in the right because of a slow heavily loaded truck, i moved to the left and just stayed there for a while because again the signs said \"Slower Traffic Keep Right\", after a couple miles some guy zooms up on on my doing like 75mph in the 65 zone, goes right honks and gives me the finger and then after hes around me goes left again, then i see flashing lights behind me, figure great a cop with a complex about the left lane, i go right and on to the shoulder but he flies right past me in the left lane and stops the other guy.

Or do you mean something else?",

Original answer linked - Please upvote the original questions and answers.\n***\n\nQuestion | Answer | Link\n---------|----------|----------|\nI\u2019m sorry for your suffering|hehe, i know you are joking, but i didnt suffer till election night. There i realised that in 8 years, so little changed  in the way politics are treated in the USA, and now im just sad for you. And for the rest of the world too.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/l28uu6/i_watched_12000_hours_of_united_states_politic/gk41du7/)\nWhat did u find out|so many topics, but the core idea is that the marketing of reality that the USA is very very very good at, is destroying your social fabric. What the country has done to herself in that regard was the perfect \"culture\" for someone like Donald Trump to emerge.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/l28uu6/i_watched_12000_hours_of_united_states_politic/gk3ymvd/)\nWhy are you so interested in American politics?|Even if im apolitical ( i think a party that has all the answers doesnt existe), i think i would be considered on the left side in the USA. I made i trip in the bible belt in 2011, and one year later i felt that there was no representation of the people in what you call social platforms and mainstream media (this include FOX NEWS). So i tried to see it by myself instead of just being in a particular sub or tv channel.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/l28uu6/i_watched_12000_hours_of_united_states_politic/gk3ytpd/)\nWhat news sources did you use to study the right side of the spectrum?|I tried to watch everything i could, i cant name them all. But it was thedonald, conservatives newspaper, local TV, right side youtubers, gag or chan, groupe discussion.  My regret is not being able to includ radios stations.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/l28uu6/i_watched_12000_hours_of_united_states_politic/gk3yv9a/)\nWhy did you do it?|Five reasons i guess.  Because i saw all the empty homes in 2011 when i traveled to USA. I was, how the fuck the richest country in the world can let that happens.  I like your country (maybe its not your country) the creativity is incredible.  Ive read this book: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\\_Hero\\_with\\_a\\_Thousand\\_Faces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hero_with_a_Thousand_Faces) and since so much stuff produced in the USA is inspired by this, i though it must have an impact in real life.  When  i studied i find out  that bad or sad things generate or create more discussion than wholesome and happy stuff, i was interessed in the country with the biggest tube of information will handle it.  I wanted to stop in 2016, but i wanted to understand why Hillary Clinton lost, And Donald Trump won.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/l28uu6/i_watched_12000_hours_of_united_states_politic/gk3yz55/)\nHow were you even able to count the hours spent?|5 hours a day limit, more or less 300 day a year from beggining of 2012 to the end of 2020. Have a nice day or night.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/l28uu6/i_watched_12000_hours_of_united_states_politic/gk410ey/)\nWhat\u2019s the lost embarrassing thing you\u2019ve ever masturbated to?|the lost embarassing thing? my ex-girlfriend|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/l28uu6/i_watched_12000_hours_of_united_states_politic/gk45ep6/)\nWhy? Avarge human life is 650 000 hours (birth to death) minus sleep about 400 000 hours and you used 12 000 of it to watch US politics...|You are right! But im curious...Are you from the USA? if yes, are you aware on how influencial the country is?  If you are in Europe ( i can only talk for western Europe), but understand whats happening in the USA, you can anticipate whats gonna happen in your coutry two  to five years later.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/l28uu6/i_watched_12000_hours_of_united_states_politic/gk43m5a/)\nWhen did you think the civil tension actually started??was it back in obama's years? trump's election???what do you think it happened?|There is too much to talk, there is not a precise date. I even think that what we see now pick problems from every decade since the creation of the country.  for the 2000's, i think its deregulations, war, 2008, everything related to jobs, facebook, tweeter, corruption, reality tv syndrome, and more. The 24h news medias played a big part for me. ( i cant explain how the 2018 school shootings,  what would be a national trauma in europe for years, just feel like old news in the US)  My very impopular theory is that around 2013 something was wery wery wrong and became the sauce to tie everything.  The virtual platforms becoming the new public space (wich i think is wrong), there was the perception that if you say it loudly enough, you can change everything you think is a problem. But then ideology was the problem, republicans were, old people were, religion too. If only they could just die. Remember the candidates in 2008 and 2012, The veteran with faith and the business man with faith. It didnt work. So what do you do when nobody can represent you?  By the way both parties failed to find a response for what happened after Obama.  Democrats pushed for Hillary Clinton, who was doomed since the time she was the first lady, but didnt realise it. Please, keep in mind that the only active politicians i like are women.  And republicans....i mean, come on, a former democrat became a republican president.  Worst, a man who doesnt care about politics. They shoot themself in the foot  in 2016.  But for me...reading that people have to take 2 or 3 jobs to survive would and billionaires get billions a month is enough to make people crazy. Im not an idealist, i know that a society, sadly, grows on inequality, but this much?|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/l28uu6/i_watched_12000_hours_of_united_states_politic/gk43pr2/)\nWhat are some of the biggest differences between politics in the US and European countries?|the good vs evil thrope is on another level in the US.  I cant talk for every coutry... i know more about west Europe.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/l28uu6/i_watched_12000_hours_of_united_states_politic/gk440fq/)\nCan you help me study for my AP Government Exam? Lord knows I dont have the free time to do it on my own.|i need money. If you are willing to pay...|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/l28uu6/i_watched_12000_hours_of_united_states_politic/gk44hi7/)\nWhere are you from|Italy and Switzerland.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/l28uu6/i_watched_12000_hours_of_united_states_politic/gk484wd/)\nCongrats!  You have watched 12,000 more hours than I have, and I live here.|How do you do that? like the first hour i arrived in the US i was exposed to politics.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/l28uu6/i_watched_12000_hours_of_united_states_politic/gk4amrn/)\nThat's a lot of time and based on your other comments you seem to be a very keen observer. May I ask what country you're from?|Thank you very much, some of my friends think that if you dont have a master or more you are not able to make an observation. So your comment made my day.

            "selftext": "Hello again. Once again coming to this community to write about a high-profile case that happened in Brazil. This time, a barbaric case, as seen in the title. Sorry about my english for any mistake.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**BACKGROUND**\n\nAs the title says, a 10-year-old girl, who has been raped by her 33-year-old uncle by four years at least, ended up getting pregnant. The case came to the attention of the police last Saturday (8), but only this weekend, it came to public knowledge.\n\nThe girl was admitted to a hospital in the city of S\u00e3o Mateus, north of Esp\u00edrito Santo, last week.\n\nShe felt pain in her abdomen. A blood test showed that she was pregnant. The girl said she was raped by her own uncle.\n\nThe police investigated the case and in less than ten days surveyed. The child's uncle was indicted for rape of vulnerable and threatened.\n\nJustice decreed the arrest, but the 33-year-old man is on the run. This week, the Civil Police teams followed a lead that he would be in Bahia, went there, but could not find him.\n\nThe family scheduled the abortion procedure in Esp\u00edrito Santo, for this weekend. However, he ended up dealing with problems.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**FAMILY NEEDED TO HAVE ABORTION PROCESS IN ANOTHER STATE**\n\nIn cases of rape, Brazilian law allows abortion. However, the child was denied the request by Cassiano Ant\u00f4nio University Hospital, in Esp\u00edrito Santo. The procedure was authorized by the court.\n\nThe impediment to the procedure would be the advancement of pregnancy. The girl was 22 weeks pregnant, more than five months, and not three as included.\n\nAfter the denial, the girl traveled to another state accompanied by a social worker. The destination location, where she will perform the procedure, was kept confidential. However, more problems happened.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**PROCEDURE AND GIRL ID SECRECY BROKEN BY A ULTRA-RIGHT POLITICAL ACTIVIST**\n\nA political activist named Sara Winter disclosed on Saturday night (15) the location and address of the hospital where a 10-year-old child would have the abortion procedure since Sunday (16).\n\nConservative, supporter of far-right policies (advocate of agendas that call for the closure of the country's legislative powers, for example) and religious, Sara Winter broke the silence so that her supporters would prevent the procedure from being carried out, since Sara is totally against any abortion practice.\n\nThe location of the procedure chosen was Pernambuco, known in Esp\u00edrito Santo.\n\nThis disclosure is a violation of Article 17 of the Statute of Children and Adolescents, which ensures the preservation of the child's identity, as well as a violation of Article 286 of the Brazilian Penal Code, which prohibits publicly inciting the practice of crime.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**PROCEDURE**\n\nA group of at least 50 people was present at the site from the early hours of the day. At the request of the activist, they tried to prevent a child from entering the hospital. The police acted on the spot and got the child to enter the hospital.\n\nStill, a child was greeted with cries of \"murderer\", for performing the abortion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**FUTURE OF CASE**\n\nA search for the offender (the 33-year-old uncle) was carried out by the local police in the interior of Bahia, where his parents reside. However, the police found nothing and the perpetrator is considered a fugitive from justice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\nUPDATE:\nScenes of tonight in Pernambuco.  That's a clearly hospital invasion tentative caused by that group.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/carolinatre/status/1295109904915718146?s=19\n\nUPDATE 2 - 08/16\nI made another post to update this case. The uncle was found and arrested by police this morning in Minas Gerais.\n\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/TrueCrime/comments/ic1bxo/update_uncle_who_raped_10yearold_niece_for_four/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share\n\nSOURCES:\n\n [https://g1.globo.com/jornal-nacional/noticia/2020/08/15/menina-de-dez-anos-engravida-apos-ser-estuprada-no-espirito-santo.ghtml](https://g1.globo.com/jornal-nacional/noticia/2020/08/15/menina-de-dez-anos-engravida-apos-ser-estuprada-no-espirito-santo.ghtml) \n\n [https://oglobo.globo.com/sociedade/menina-de-10-anos-precisou-sair-do-es-para-fazer-aborto-1-24589403](https://oglobo.globo.com/sociedade/menina-de-10-anos-precisou-sair-do-es-para-fazer-aborto-1-24589403) \n\n [https://www.folhape.com.br/noticias/brasil/grupo-tenta-impedir-procedimento-em-menina-de-10-anos-gravida-apos/151074/](https://www.folhape.com.br/noticias/brasil/grupo-tenta-impedir-procedimento-em-menina-de-10-anos-gravida-apos/151074/) \n\n [https://www.uol.com.br/universa/noticias/redacao/2020/08/16/sara-winter-divulga-endereco.htm](https://www.uol.com.br/universa/noticias/redacao/2020/08/16/sara-winter-divulga-endereco.htm)",

            "selftext": " \n\nWith the news of the last twab, i\u2019m seeing a lot of concern about our beloved armor and weapon. People are annoyed because their hard-earned high-stat armor will become irrelevant in a few season. So, i\u2019m coming with some ideas :\n\n1 \u2013 Make Banshee Great Again\n\nAs of now, Banshee is just a slighty enhanced vendor. We aren\u2019t seeing anything of his gunsmith ability. So, I propose this :  \n\n\\- When we get a random-rolled weapon, his perk are added to the \u00ab Discovered Perk Pool \u00bb of this weapon. When we go to Banshee, we got a new possiblity : in exchange of mats and shards, we can replace a weapon\u2019s perk with another one we previously discovered. Same for the Masterwork : I propose the possibility to modify the masterwork like we did with Y1 weapons.\n\nWith this, people will continue to pursue the perk they want, and will be able to experiment new possibilities, instead of farming again and again the same strike for weeks.\n\n\\- For the armor, the added possibility to relocate stat point, and, with the use of enhancement core to add more point to a stat, until the max armor stat point is reached.\n\nWith this, it will be way easier to minmax, but player will still pursue higher-stat armor, so that they use less ressources in the enhancement of it.\n\n2 \u2013 Making the Mercury Forge relevant\n\nSome of you may not know this, but Mercury got a cool feature tied to the original Saint \u2013 14 quest, where we builded the various Mercury Forge Weapon, to then go to Saint\u2019s grave into the Infinite Forest, ending with the Perfect Paradox. But, aside from that, the Forge is useless. I propose this :\n\nAlong with the previous idea of \u00ab Discovered Perk Pool \u00bb, I propose a new mechanics to the Mercury Forge : the possibility to fully craft a weapon. We choose the weapon in our collection, then we build it how we want it, using the Discovered Perk Pool. With this, player will still pursue random \u2013 rolled weapon, to gain more and more perks.\n\n3 \u2013 More control for the loot\n\nSome people are searching for days, even weeks, for either a specific piece of armor or weapon. I got this with the Iron Banner : when I want armor i get weapon, when I want weapon I get armor. So, I propose two things :  \n\n\\- The creation of 3 new consumable : one to allow all random \u2013 roll to be weapon for a set duration, one to allow all random \u2013 roll to be armor for a set duration, one last to reset this to a neutral stat where you can get anything, like now.\n\n\\- The added possibility to buy only armor or weapons to a vendor.\n\nFeel free to comment my ideas !",

                "IMO loot should be acquired by playing the game, not collecting materials and sitting in front of a vendor for an hour. It is already a chore to start every Destiny play session with a 20 minute visit to the tower to get bounties, clear out the postmaster, and reduce my inventory to just the minimum gun options for what I plan to play. Everyone acts like getting a 'bad roll' of a gun means the gun is unusable, which is just not true. Finding a gun you like should be half the fun, then you actively pursue a better roll so you can masterwork and frame it on the wall of you player inventory. I personally want the devs to reduce the total amount of materials I have to collect. I play Destiny to use space magic, not to play inventory manager 2020: quarantine edition.",

                "Gear sunseting should mean less layers to weapon RNG. Lets take WoW as an example. Gear is sunset every expansion. Drops for gear are 99% RNG.

                " I like it, but this could be a double edged sword. Remove farming for a god roll weapon, and you lose an incentive to continue playing. People complain there\u2019s nothing to do, and they leave.\n\nI think it would work with some balancing. First, this is a very powerful mechanic and needs to involve some important decisions. I suggest a new exotic currency, the golden age weapon schematic fragment. These can drop from any enemy, any place. Think strange coins from D1, but a fair bit rarer. A god roll weapon can be as powerful as an exotic, so make the process of creating almost as rare. This keeps farming in the game, but now you can do it anywhere you like.\n\nBecause this can be abused, I suggest that a limit of 2 weapon creations per week for an account be implemented. Guns should also have a perk limit. You can\u2019t have 4 god perks in each category. Also, every perk applied to the gun has a slight drawback (e.g. outlaw removes some reload speed); this should keep naturally occurring god rolls still a desirable and viable option. Exotic weapon specific perks are unable to be used.\n\nTo use these perks, they must be unlocked. When you take apart a weapon, you make that corresponding perk available for unlock in a new perk tab under the collections screen. Perks cost legendary shards and gunsmith materials to unlock, probably around 50 - 100 legendary shards and 200 - 250 gunsmith materials. \n\nAnd finally, to make this a worth while, there is a second new tab in collections, the custom weapons tab. Once you create a weapon, you keep that preset and are able to re-acquire it multiple times, until that preset is deleted. Each gun is titled with its name followed by \u201ccustom-00\u201d. To keep server space from being overrun, each account is only given 30 slots.",

                "No changes to any system can make me agree with sunsetting armour and weapons. They can\u2019t make any content fun or compelling enough to play because they\u2019ve functionally given up; so they need to artificially drive up player engagement by forcing us to spend all that time grinding new weapons and armour just to *get back to where we were*. \n\nWe\u2019ve already seen this season, that numerical changes to gun stats is enough to flip the pvp meta on its head. How hard is it for them to understand that having a huge weapon pool with almost all of them worth farming is better then being shoehorned into using what they want us to use. It blows my mind."

A lot of us are working in fields that really aren't terribly relevant to politics -- theoretical computer science is cool, and I'm sure theoretical computer scientists on average have a better grip of politics than the average merkin, but a degree in theoretical CS doesn't confer a whole lot of perceived authority on political issues outside of maybe software patents, which have yet to influence a single election. Similar for physics, mathematics, chemistry. Climatology is a tiny field by comparison. I'd be surprised to hear there were more than 100 climatology PhDs / year in the whole country.

It was difficult for them to retain credibility and admit defeat in the public's eye, so they found it easier to refute heliocentric evidence on a theological basis instead of truly considering the new data and arguments.\n\n**TL;DR: Scientists can be advocates, but it is nearly impossible for an advocate to be a scientist.**",

My impression is that it takes certain character traits to be a successful politician, both in the US and other western countries. This might be a positive stereotype, but most engineers I know have a sense of honesty, integrity and open-mindedness I rarely find in other people. Someone like that in any public office would be eaten up by interest groups and lobbyists, or at least meet more obstacles than someone of more \"persuasive\" character. I think political debate and course of action should ideally be rooted in logic, solid information, knowledge and insight. But that's not how the current public political landscape in the US works. It's about having the best rhetoric and the biggest shit-bucket to throw at your opponent.\n\n\nApart from promoting science to the public, I think it's a good idea for scientists to focus on how to improve their communication to a layman audience. A lot of people even have trouble understanding what **'inconclusive'** means. Maybe the media is to blame for this expectation of yes/no answers, I don't know. I vaguely remember a good example of this kind of communication error from earlier this year. Some scientists in Italy didn't get their *'inconclusive'* earthquake report across to neither the politicians nor the media, so both parties interpreted it as a *'it's guaranteed that an earthquake will not happen'*. And then an earthquake struck in L'Aquila, and the scientists know face manslaughter charges.\n\nTL;DR Promoting science to the public is always a good idea, but that's not the same as encouraging scientists into public office.

When she doesn't take her meds for her bipolar disorder, she really goes off the deep end. She's already been hospitalized three times this year. The last time, her therapist called protective services on her and somehow, her parents now have partial custody of her 20 month old child. \n\nAnother thing, I haven't spoken to her for about 2 weeks now and I'm starting to get worried. She always either answers my texts and calls or she'll initiate conversation but now nothing. Last conversation we had was a little disturbing. She claimed her mother has been hiding her meds from her and that's how she got hospitalized the last time. \n\nI have to take what she tells me with a grain of salt because she has lied to me about stuff in the past such as being married to her son's father. That was such a huge issue because he passed away last year and her peers wondered why she didn't qualify for widow benefits. Turns out, they were never married. \n\nPoint is, there are pros and cons to Britney being under conservatorship but yeah, I don't understand how most people who seem worse off, are not in the same position as her and yes, I can see how all this could just be a ruse to have complete control over her money. \n\nOn the other hand, what would have happened to Britney had no one stepped in? Would she have ended up yet another Hollywood fatality? Would money still have been an issue for the family? Don't forget, celebs sadly are worth more dead than alive. Perfect example, Michael Jackson. He was millions and millions of dollars in debt and now his estate is said to be worth around $825 million (and counting!) \n\nUgh maybe we shouldn't even comment because most of us are not psychiatrists nor know the full details but it does make you wonder. She's been under this since 2008 and that's a long time! You'd think they would have gradually given her more independence over the years but it seems like that hasn't happened....",

The problem is that once you start going down the road of moral grey areas for privacy, even if the person/company going down that road honestly believes they are doing what\u2019s right for your privacy, you can\u2019t go back. So if Apple reaches a point where they realize they made a mistake in all this, it will be too late.

Even with open source systems, while they are auditable, like how many are actually going through all those lines of code?\n\nApple very clearly misunderstood how much the tech community trusts them to \"do the right thing\" especially when governments can try to strong arm them into doing the wrong thing. But, you do have to admit that Apple's track record so far about privacy has been pretty great, exactly because of instances like this.\n\nAgain, just saying it's complicated. If you have absolutely no trust that Apple will protect your privacy and you care about that, this isn't the platform for you.

            "selftext": "My kitchen table group is sort of a rotation of 6 people. There's one guy who is really defensive and will accept almost any terms to preserve his board state and his life total, so I end up winning a lot of games by finding key moments to convince him to leave my (much bigger) threats alone if I leave his alone.  \n\nRecently I had monogreen and a board full of creatures including [[Vigor]]. Bad Deals guy had monowhite lifegain and was right after me in the turn order. My attacks for turn included a little 3/3 at him which he elected to block with a 6/6. The other players pointed out that he would be buffing my guy to a 9/9, and he said he didn't care. He didn't want to take 3 damage. Now, if that doesn't scream board wipe, I don't know what does. I'm trying get [[Craterhoof Behemoth]] etc. rolling next turn, so I really dont want to see that.  \n\nAs it happens, he had a big lifelink flier that was synergizing with his life gain board beautifully until it got permanently stolen by the Izzet player. He was definitely sad about that, so I offered to get it back for him if he agreed not to board wipe or attack me next turn. He agreed as long as I also didn't attack him on my next turn. I dropped [[Homeward Path]], the deal was kept, I wiped out another player with a Craterhoof effect, drew a metric ton of cards through [[Toski, Bearer of Secrets]] and made scores of treasures with [[Old Gnawbone]]. I was able to fog, etc. through mono-white's ensuing turn and then easily win with all of those treasures and cards.  \n\nMy concern is that the other two players probably feel cheated, as if monowhite guy and I were colluding and he gave me an assist. Should I avoid suckering him into bad deals, or is that just part of the game? Should they have tried to talk him out of it with counteroffers? I'm not sure how to feel. It kind of seems like a grimy win.  \n\nEdit: Thanks for the replies. To clarify, this guy is not new or inexperienced. He's been playing just as long as I have with roughly the same frequency.",

It is, as you say, not a good deal. It should probably be mentioned to him that he's throwing away games by making these deals, but it's also worth noting that at any time your opponents could've made him aware that the deal is bad.\n\nYour goal is to make your deal seem as appealing as possible. It's the job of your opponents to point out the flaws in the deal, and it's up to the recipient to figure out the truth. That's the game of politics. You did nothing wrong.",

                "\"sistemul e rigged oarecum s\u0103 se schimbe greu.\"\n\nDa, fix asta e ideea intr-o democratie. Spre deosebire de dictaturi, unde deciziile nu trebuie explicate si justificate, in democratie e nevoie sa convingi segmente din clasa conducatoare si populatie ca ideea ta e buna, trebuie sa justifici deciziile public si ai o serie de institutii si legi care sunt gandite more or less sa iti puna bete in roate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDesi pare contraproductiv, sistemul, desi evolueaza incet, are o evolutie pozitiva constanta. Cu cat e mai departe in evolutie, cu atat ea prinde viteza si sistemul devine mai rezistent la perturbari (gen crize economice, pandemii, razboaie,etc.).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSa luam de exemplu o dictatura luminata. Sa ne imaginam ca Ciolos preia cumva puterea in Romania si instaureaza o dictatura. Si sa zicem ca o face din pura dorinta de a schimba tara in bine. Cel mai probabil nu o sa ii iasa, pt ca indiferent de cat de bune sunt intentiile, daca nu ai pe cineva langa tine care sa te contrazica si sa te faca sa iti explici actiunile, o sa gresesti inevitabil. Cam pe principiul pleaca ai tai de acasa si o iei razna.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nO alta chestie care mi se pare interesanta, cea mai buna idee intr-o societate unde democratia e inca tanara si nu exista institutii puternice care sa actioneze ca checks and balances o reprezinta coalitiile largi. Pentru ca fortele care formeaza coalitiile alea largi actioneaza intr-o mai mica sau mai mare masura ca si checks and balances unele pt altele.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSi ca sa inchei, suntem cam pe unde trebuie sa fim. E normal sa evoluam lent. Polonia si Ungaria, care au dat-o in regimuri autoritare, s-au miscat mai repede ca noi fix pt ca au dat-o in regimuri autoritare. Si e un cal pierzator pe termen lung, vor pierde cursa si deja incepe sa fie vizibil asta.",

Eventually, you spring the trap on dad and reveal that you two were actually in love the whole time.

Just do it harder.\n\nSpend the next ten or so years accumulating accolades through any means necessary, so that when you finally decide to retire you can say \"i am one of the best\". \n\nOnce you stop working full time, keep coming to work, and bring your wife. Make life bad for all the new guys working at your company. \n\nWhen the guys at work are tired of you, call maybe three of your old buddies and say \"we will have a match to end our careers\". Make sure the match is terrible, so as to further make life bad for everyone.\n\nIn one of your last acts as a god at your company, have a heart attack but defeat it and say \"i have won mother nature\".\n\nCongrats, you have successfully politicized your way through life, HHH style.",

Et c'est l\u00e0 je pense qu'il ne faut pas se tromper dans l'\u00e9valuation : le fait que ce soit pire ailleurs ou que les \u00e9trangers voient notre politique comme plut\u00f4t fiable/efficace/sereine (je globalise les avis que j'ai pu lire en r\u00e9ponse) ne doit pas diminuer le fait que dans notre contexte, on ne peut pas se satisfaire de ce qu'on voit chez nous. \n\nOn a la chance d'avoir beaucoup d'acquis sociaux mais ils demeurent tr\u00e8s fragiles face au d\u00e9tricotage qui leurs sont impos\u00e9s depuis de nombreuses ann\u00e9es.

Malheureusement j'ai plut\u00f4t le sentiment qu'on s'inspire de ce qui se fait mal ailleurs et que le mot d'ordre quasi g\u00e9n\u00e9ral est de nous marteler qu'on est plus privil\u00e9gi\u00e9s que dans d'autres pays et que la \"logique\" serait de supprimer au maximum les aides comme c'est le cas ailleurs \"parce que y a pas d'argent magique\" (sauf pour les potes et les cabinets de conseil).",

They can't speak Hungarian, some of them barely even speaks English. They are a RUSSIAN company BASED in Hungary.\n\nThey came here since taxes for companies are one of the lowest in the region and since our prime minister is the lapdog of Putin (only a bit better than Lukashenko) Russian companies will not get investigated or harassed for not paying taxes after the employees unlike in other Eu countries.\n\nThe main reason they came here together with Sberbank, so they can move money freely withtin the European union. Wargaming (a Russian game developer, what a surprise also based in Hungary)  already got charges filed against it by the EU countries for money laundering and financing shady deals inside of the EU for the Russian government. \n\nNo politics: Yeah we already saw how that works.  When a Chinese player spams glory to the CCCP that is fine.

What they should have done is to embrace the negativity and flip it over to double down on their own statement of none political things, plus this is a game and we do not promote war etc... but! it's more difficult right? so, no no, we have players with more than 10 years playing they can survive this...\n\nAre my words ignoring the Ukrainians suffering and all affected Russian people that are innocent from their own government's actions? ABSOLUTELY NOT!... I wish this conflict never happened in the first place, with or without Gaijing's muteness... I just can't do anything to help anyone no matter how much I'd love to.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, Gaijing could have released a pack of special vehicles, to promote donations to help Ukrainians families during this conflict... just like the Overwatch Mercy's pink skin that was added to help and promote the breast cancer... but again, taking actions to really take steps against war instead of muting themselves is too much work for them...",

Japan is closer to Russia and the US than it is to South Asia (India, Sri Lanka, Singapore, etc.) It makes a little more sense when you consider the company's named Gaijin and there are probably weebs making these decisions that are totally oblivious to the difference between South Asia and East Asia.\nThere's also the fact that they refuse to comment negatively on the invasion of Ukraine, I understand that they don't want to lose their Russian player base but the fact that they operate outside the US/UK shows that they don't have to follow ethics guidelines. You can say that companies like EA and Epic with their lootboxes and microtransactions are pretty unethical but the fact that they condemn the invasion atleast shows some sympathy.\nI think putting the Ukrainian flag on a tank is fine, putting a Russian flag on a tank is fine but the white Z of the invasion force is not ok at all."

Dar hei...Romanul stie doar de cele 3 lucrari din Tg Jiu in materie de sculpturi ale lui Brancusi + a mai aflat de una cand a aparut Cumintenia Pamantului in presa acum 4ish ani..... GG cu cultura.\n\nO fi Ionita un prost, dar ma deranjeaza mult mai mult informatia truncheata.\n\nRevenind asupra culturii.... nu sustin ca lucrarile expuse in primaria sect 1 constituie arta culta (personal, consider ca tematica si modul de expunere utilizat este o re-re-re-regurgitare a imaginii de fertilitate a femeii cu un mix de tribalism/ elemente de putere sau de fragilitate, dupa caz in fc de lucrari) dar pt o societate afundata in kitsch.... e bine ca se mai expune si altceva in afara de icoane, reclame, [corporate art](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4IFP1PgyyU&ab_channel=CarrefourRomania)... gandite sa nu treazeasca nimic ci doar sa fie safe si usor de digerat.\n\nRomanul de rand nu ar putea sa tolereze un peisaj renascentist (care incearca sa prezinte o imagine foarte similara realitatii, fara prea mult exprimare plastica (deformari, etc)) daca ar include o femeie nud deja ~e rusine maica~.....Nasterea lui Venus (o lucrare pudica atat pt vremea respectiva dar si dupa standardul de acum) ar provoca exclamatia clasica de ~ i se vede \u021b\u00e2\u021ba, bre~ + ~ cine plm e Venus?~\n\nTrecand si asupra titlului .....Faptul ca nea Simion a simtit nevoia sa aminteasca numele original al lucrarii (Coloana sacrificiului infinit....cica...nu este nimic probat in acest sens) nu face decat sa reafirme intentia lui Simion de a trunchea si de a contorsiona orice in favoarea discursului sau. Numele unei lucrari este casi-irelevant (Mona Lisa este numita si Gioconda si Madonna ....si niciunul dintre acestea nu este numele original al lucrarii ci doar nume date de oameni pe parcursul timpului), valoarea lucrarii nu este data de nume pt ca o persoana cu cuget liber si capacitatea de analiza + care a vazut o mana de lucrari de arta la viata lui poate sa isi formeze singur o opinie care poate fi apropiata de adevar, fara a stii semnificatia/cine a facut lucrarea respectiva/numele lucrarii ...sau macar sa provoace inceputul unui proces mai amplu de cercetare pt a intelege opera........ \n\nSchimbarea numelui oferei nu este dacat o tentativa ieftina de a provoca spectatorul sa ~digere~ lucrarea intr-o anumita maniera si, in consecinta, sa se alinieze gandirii ieftine a lui nea Simion..... Nenea nu poate accepta ca unii pot sa mance singuri si nu doar din lingurita lui jegoasa....\n\nPersonal, cred ca toata chestia cu ~sacrificiu~ asociata Colonaei a aparut avand in vedere cine a comisionat lucrarea (o grupare de femei care dorea sa comemoreze sacrificiul soldatilor pe front) dar trairea artistului nu este insuflata de comanda unui tert, acesta produce ceea ce simte.... presupun ca de aici a aparut notiunea de ~infinit~. Daca este sa analizam, Coloana Infinitului nici macar nu este o creatie originala pt Brancusi, ci doar o reiteratie/ dezvoltare a unei idei pe care a avut-o cu 10-20 de ani inainte de a realiza Coloana din Tg Jiu.\n\nAcelasi comision a inclus si Masa Tacerii. Daca nea Simion era mai perspicace lua aceasta lucrare ca exemplu ( si schimba tweet-ul in ceva despre credinta si nu suferinta) pt postare pt ca Brancusi a mai avut lucrari de inspiratie religioasa + Masa Tacerii urla a simbolistica biblica (masa = cina cea de taina. 12 scaune (apostoli) in jurul mesei (Iisus)). Masa Tacerii provine din acelasi comision ca si Coloana....Asta de ce nu are conotanie de suferinta, domnule Simon? Doar coloana are pt ca vrei tu, bre? Putem accepta ca Brancusi producea ceea ce  simtea, fara sa aiba o simbolistica legata de comisionar?\n\nTLDR - Am argumentat de ce Simion este un prost care nu face altceva decat sa truncheze si sa contorsioneze arta pt a sustine discursul sau de kkt.",

                ">people do not necessarily behave or believe how they present themselves. Online, and in person or on media there may be people who withhold on giving a full more controversial opinion in order to make their stances more palatable. \n\nThis has always been the case. The Internet has actually made public discourse more anonymous than ever before, allowing people to give the most controversial, least palatable opinions they have. Of course people still stifle themselves a little bit, but probably did so much more back when speaking publicly but anonymously was almost impossible. It's important to note that controversial opinions aren't necessarily immoral or incorrect ones. For example, racial equality used to be politically incorrect.\n\n>Infiltrate to provide strawman ammunition for other groups or attempt to rat on other groups.\n\nYes, sock-puppeting is a new risk. It's a different issue than people hiding their unpalatable beliefs, though. There are official and unofficial laws and rules against trolling, doxing, impersonating, etc. which attempt to mitigate the real-life impact of such behaviors.\n\n>Can a dialogue be controlled for the common person entirely through this?\n\nYes, but that was always the case. It's true that individuals, private organizations, and even governments are astroturfing and sock-puppeting to push narratives on the Internet. But before the Internet, dialogue was still opaque and controlled. The media, the government, and the clergy decided what people heard and said. Remember this \"this is extremely dangerous to our democracy\" video? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZggCipbiHwE\n\nThe Internet just democratized speech. It's comparable to the printing press. Before the printing press, the church and government controlled all information; after the printing press, anyone could write a book, publish their ideas, and let the free market of ideas run with them. This led to great scientific and cultural advancements, but also huge religious and political upheavals and terrible wars. I think we can't take the good without the bad.\n\nThere are still authoritarian governments (North Korea, China, Russia, etc.) where free speech is sacrificed and policed, ostensibly for the sake of national unity. Everything people do online (or in person) is monitored. Publications must be approved. You can go to jail for criticizing or even politely disagreeing with the government's decisions, which they tend to label as \"spreading misinformation\". Since this is a free country, I'm free to say that I think there can be benefits to that sort of system, but I don't they're worth the drawbacks.",
                "So you're asking what the impact of this is? People maintain polite views around folks and then vote how they really feel. There are also lots of \"dog whistles\" for people to get really fucking upset over.\n\nThat's about it I think"

My dad 50 has put up with this his whole life. \n\nWhen I asked him about it he just says that is the way his brother is and always has been. \n\nMy mom basically banned him from our house when I was growing up so I only saw him at family events. At weddings where he would say the groom looked like a f**, or that the bride looked pregnant. Thanksgiving where he would tell offensive jokes at the table. Or a birthday party where he said the food tasted like shit. \n\nI M27 recently bought a house with my girlfriend 23.  It is small and needs work but we can afford it with a lot of help from our families and the bank.\n\nWe had a housewarming this weekend and had a BBQ. It was the first time we could host a big group as I only had a bachelor apartment and my girlfriend lived with her dad.  \n\nMy dad invited my uncle, I did not. \n\nMy uncle shows up and starts being himself. He starts calling my home a shit hole and asks my girlfriend why she is with a loser like me. \n\nI ask him to come out in the front yard to talk for a second and I read him the riot act.  I do not give a shit that other people have coddled him his whole life. If he cannot be civil then he is welcome to GTFO. \n\nI was not quiet. I'm pretty sure everyone in my back yard could hear me telling him to behave like a fucking civilized adult. \n\nHe left, but spent the rest of the day texting everyone there including his mom, my grandmother, and saying that it's not his fault that I overreacted to his behaviour. It put a damper on the party. His family are kind of on his side. But my mom's family and my friends are backing me. \n\n AITA?",

It subsequently ended up in TwoHotTakes*\n\n[**AITA? My daughter doesn\u2019t want me in her life because of our differences in political opinions**](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/13do1aa/aita_my_daughter_doesnt_want_me_in_her_life/) \\- 10 May 2023\n\nThings haven\u2019t been the same since an incident several years ago and my other daughter told me to ask on Reddit.\n\nI (M65) have two daughters, Alicia (35) and Mary (32). I am divorced from their mother since the girls were in middle school and have been with my current partner Janice for 15 years but we are not married. My girls were living with me full time since they were in high school until they each moved out.\n\nI\u2019ll get right to it, my girl\u2019s have opposing political views from Janice and I. This came to a head several years ago, things had been strained for a while and finally blew up. The girls were over for Christmas and Mary said some things that upset Janice and Mary walked out. Alicia stayed but it was awkward the rest of the day. Janice and I decided not to let Mary visit anymore but I still saw her regularly on my own or with Alicia.\n\nA year or so after that I took Alicia out for breakfast on her birthday. We had decided not to talk about politics anymore because we don\u2019t get along. Well there was something upsetting on the TV and the restaurant was empty except for us and another couple and I made a comment about it, and Alicia just started ranting. She wouldn\u2019t stop even when I told her to because she said I was the one who brought it up. The man at the other table agreed with me and started getting upset, saying what Alicia was saying was stupid and that she should shut up. I agreed with him. Yet another day ruined I guess so I just walked out. I told her happy birthday before I left.\n\nShe was very upset that I \u201cabandoned\u201d her with a stranger that was upset with her, but all she had to do was stop talking and that never would have happened. She said she felt unsafe and that I shouldn\u2019t have just left her there, and maybe I shouldn\u2019t have, but she also needs to take responsibility for her part in this.\n\nNow she barely speaks to me and I only see her on special occasions like birthdays or Father\u2019s Day. And never at either of our houses. She moved and hasn\u2019t told me where, it is somewhere local though. I see Mary more often but she doesn\u2019t want to get involved with me and Alicia\u2019s issues. AITA for not taking total responsibility for what happened?\n\n*Notable comments from OOP*\n\n>I don\u2019t think it was the right place to have a heated discussion. Other people around us have the right to a quiet meal in a public space. If she wanted to have that discussion we could have done it privately. She was disturbing others that\u2019s why I wanted her to stop.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I made one comment in passing, I didn\u2019t keep talking about it. She could have just made one comment back and left it at that but she kept going even after I asked her to stop.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I\u2019m not racist and I think people should have bodily autonomy. For instance, no one should be forced to get any vaccine they don\u2019t want to.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I kept it vague on purpose because the specifics of who believes what don\u2019t really matter here.\n\n\u00a0\n\n*OOP's daughter 'Alicia' posts two days later.

Those aren\u2019t our real names, thankfully.\n\nThere are screenshots of two conversations with him in my profile. One from the day of this incident in 2018, and one Facebook messenger conversation from 2020. I have more and may post them but for now that should be enough. Yes I made a throwaway for this, I don\u2019t want it attached to my main.\n\nMy friend actually saw the post first and told me about it, and I considered for a while whether or not I should respond. It also took me a minute to find the conversations. I did want to address some things because even though the post was lacking details, most of the comments I was able to read were spot on, and this was very validating for me.\n\n\u2022 As most of you guessed, yes, he is a Republican Trump supporter and I am progressive. And yes, we are in the US.\n\n\u2022 This was pre Covid, he came out as an anti-vaxxer during the pandemic.\n\n\u2022 Janice is horrible lol. On the outside she seems sorta ok but she\u2019s all about manipulation and control. If you aren\u2019t wholly grateful for every little thing she does she employs guilt trips. She\u2019s definitely the \u201crespect your elders\u201d type. There\u2019s more to the story there but I\u2019m not going into it.\n\n\u2022 We used to all have family dinners at their house once or twice a month. The atmosphere had been strained for a while because dad and Janice didn\u2019t want Mary and I to comment about politics. They were allowed to say anything they wanted but we weren\u2019t allowed to respond. We were told it was DISRESPECTFUL to disagree with them in their own home. I thought it was very hypocritical and it pissed me off. When I lived with them I never really stated my opinions much out loud because I wanted to keep the peace. Because I had to live there. As I got older and moved out I stopped being quiet about it and I think it shocked them. I was tired of listening to racist misogynistic nonsense and not saying anything about it. I was civil about it, I didn\u2019t name call or make it personal. Them on the other hand is a different story. Apparently I\u2019m a \u201cliberal extremist\u201d according to my dad who said that to my face. Because I believe in civil rights and equal rights for everyone. Ok.\n\n\u2022 That day at Christmas my sister and I were talking about climate change amongst ourselves and they butted into the conversation and it exploded from there. We weren\u2019t talking to them, at all, and they started being passive aggressive and accusing us of thinking they were stupid, which neither of us said. My sister had apparently had enough of it all and walked out. She was never invited over again. I continued to visit but I too was eventually told I wasn\u2019t going to be invited again.\n\n\u2022 The topic on tv in the caf\u00e9 was about whichever mass shooting or police shooting had just unfolded at the time, I don\u2019t remember specifically. I also don\u2019t remember the exact wording of my dad\u2019s comment, but it was something about guns and/or minorities. My comments in response were about gun control and statistically the demographic of most mass shooters (white men, sorry not sorry), and he as a white man took offense to that. So did the other boomer white man at the table next to us. I didn\u2019t care, I wouldn\u2019t have started it but I was SICK of him getting in his little comments and thinking I wouldn\u2019t say anything back because we agreed not to talk about things like that.\n\n\u2022 After my dad\u2019s initial snide comment and I started listing statistics, my dad told me to stop talking. I said \u201cwhy? I\u2019m not ashamed of anything I\u2019m saying\u201d. Neither of us were being loud by the way, it was a private conversation at a normal speaking volume. At that point the other man sitting with his wife said loudly \u201cwell I\u2019d like her to shut up!\u201d And started saying things about how what I was saying was stupid. I sat there in shock and just as I was about to collect myself and tell him to fuck off my dad turned around to him and said \u201cyou know what sir, I agree with you\u201d which put me into shock again. I literally could not believe that just happened. My dad then stood up, muttered happy birthday at me, and walked out. The man continued to spout angry nonsense in my direction while his wife tried to calm him down, and I tried to think about how fast I could get to the police station next door if he tried something. I sat there for a few minutes in shock and his wife came over to me and started apologizing profusely. I eventually left too and tried not to cry on my way home.\n\n\u2022 Not that it matters a whole bunch, but we drove there separately and had paid for our food already. So he didn\u2019t leave me without a way home and didn\u2019t stick me with the bill.\n\n\u2022 Ever since I started speaking up about my opinions my dad has been very patronizing and condescending. It\u2019s funny though because even then at first when we\u2019d debate something we would be civil and I could get him to listen to me. I even got him to indirectly admit that he\u2019s pro choice once during a conversation. He doesn\u2019t identify as that but when we spoke logically and reasonably about it he admitted that at least in some situations abortion should be allowed. I said congratulations that makes you pro choice, and he didn\u2019t have anything to say to that lol I think it\u2019s the buzz words and the faux news that\u2019s really tripped him up and it\u2019s unfortunate.\n\n\u2022 He and Janice live very much in their own little fantasy land and don\u2019t like being reminded that it isn\u2019t real. They\u2019ve stopped going to family events partly because of this and partly because of Janice\u2019s medical condition. AND I think partly because no one likes her.\n\nI already turned off messages and I don\u2019t really want to be responding to a bunch of comments, I might turn them off altogether at some point if that\u2019s an option but we\u2019ll see how this goes. This has already gotten waaayyyy more attention than I\u2019m comfy with, but I didn\u2019t want to leave everyone hanging. There were some really insightful comments that gleaned a lot of truth without knowing the full situation so I wanted to give some closure. And also to say thanks, this has helped me a lot. As for what I\u2019m going to do about it in real life, probably nothing, because I\u2019m pretty much done trying to do anything but keep up a surface level relationship. Once in a while he tells my sister he misses me, as if he doesn\u2019t understand what happened. We\u2019ve had so many conversations about this that if he doesn\u2019t get it by now he never will, and I\u2019m done trying. If you\u2019re wondering why I don\u2019t just cut him out completely, I\u2019m not really sure myself. I guess I just don\u2019t have it in me right now.\n\n**Reminder - I am not the original poster. Also please remember the no-brigading rule**",

They sit down and think of a punchline and when making the connections that'll make that punchline work they don't \"make connections\" with the logic of the movie, they instead sever them \"this part makes my joke unfunny, lose it!\"\n\nThey maybe doing this for the fun of it, but they seem to have a genuine contempt for films and their viewers *(My viewerships are a bunch of facebook moms, gamer-word-spouting 12 year olds and Teenage-Becky's anyway, they won't notice shit!)*\n\nI tried watching them since 2012 over the course of a few times and they just are so unfunny and obtuse about their writing/movie watching, I don't think I've ever really made it through a full video out a massive eye roll that rips my optic nerves out of my eyesockets and all over my keyboard but I'm so pissed off I can still google \"Cinema Sins sucks\". But the most annoying thing about their \"comedic minds\" is them backpedaling on any form of criticism on their jokes, that we're taking the movie too seriously when their whole premise is to take a movie seriously.\n\nI legit think Rich Evans could be given 5 hours a week to make a \"CinemaSins\" video and you'd actually get something funnier and way more honest.",

                "I love the MCU overall, but their main problem is absolutely boilerplate storytelling and difficulty separating films on a tonal basis. GoTG 1&2, Homecoming, Winter Soldier, Ragnarok, Black Panther, Civil War, Avengers, Iron Man and Endgame succeed because they place greater emphasis on character, narrative or tone. Many of the other films are decent but bland and overdone (Black Widow, Thors, Ant-Man) or focus on telling the same thing again and again. Like how many characters are reformed spies? Assassins? Trained killers from children? Goofy slackers? Sure, it's fun in the moment and enjoyable as a cultural event for a couple weeks, but it's frustrating that the largest franchise seems to think big theatrical swings consist of overloading on characters, adding nonsensical \"dramatic\" sequences or including Marvel legacy characters. The shows are a large step in the right direction for comic-booky variety and distinction, but 30 projects in, shouldn't we be a lot better off?",

Dave Chappelle comedy specials typically don't have enough ratings to even feature an audience score. Hell, his 2 most recent ones before S&S aren't even on Rotten Tomatoes. Why worry about a fucking RT audience score? I never pay attention to those anyway because of dumb bombarding shit like this.\n\nEDIT: Okay so his other comedy specials *are* on RT, just under a TV show that shares his name (NOT The Dave Chappelle Show). It says it has a 90% audience score, but when you look at the individual specials, it's got 0 engagement / ratings. So I don't know what gives there. Those specials reviewed well for critics though.

                "I mean, look at European countries, they're still debating which country is truly Western.\n\nIn Slavoj Zizek's \"What Does Europe Want?\", many Western European nationalists consider themselves as part of the West and not Eastern Europe due to its Slavic and Cold War past.\n\nSlovenian nationalists say they're part of the West because they're the richest ex-Yugoslavian country.\n\nCroatian nationalists say they're part of the West for its large Catholic population which Bosnia & Herzegovina and Albania don't have due to its large Muslim population and they consider Islam as barbaric.\n\nAustrian nationalists would not consider Slovenia and Croatia part of the West due to its identity being Slavic and on the basis, they're still Slavs.\n\nNorthern Italian nationalists won't consider those from Southern Italy as part of the West due to its lineage being descended from the Moors.\n\nGerman nationalists, especially in the North won't consider Austria as part of the West because of Austria's history with the Austrian-Hungarian Empire and they tried to start their own Germany during the Third Reich and failed.\n\nFrench nationalists won't consider Germany part of the West because of the Nazis.\n\nAnd British nationalists consider the U.K. as the real progenitor of the West and the rest of the countries are just part of the Eastern Bloc. Also, they won't consider Irish people as part of the West due to Eugenics and Racist Laws they earlier had when they colonized Ireland.\n\n[https://youtu.be/3jBy6S-6FpE?t=604](https://youtu.be/3jBy6S-6FpE?t=604)\n\nThis is from the video I'm quoting Zizek's book\n\nNote: The rest below is not part of Zizek's book but it's just a thought.\n\nAnd you have American nationalists who consider themselves as the West because they don't consider the U.K. conservatives and Canadian conservatives as real conservatives because of their support for a public healthcare system and open and mixed tolerance for environmental, LGBTQ+, and abortion rights. They will only consider conservatives from the Eastern Bloc as part of the West due to its high Catholic and Evangelical population, lack of support for liberal movements and rights, harsh rhetoric towards immigration from the Middle East, dependence on fossil fuels, democratic backsliding, Holocaust revisionism which made Benjamin Netanyahu's condemnation for these laws emblematic as the worst person you never know who made a good point and their fetishization of these country's women being seen as traditional despite they earlier didn't see these Nazbol countries as part of the West due to its historic affiliation to the USSR. It's just that right now with these countries openness for social conservatism, they're being fetishized as right-wing utopias despite not being in the average national for life expectancy, income, and residence due to these countries' over-reliance on fossil fuels making them unbearable to live in, especially in Poland.\n\nAnd then you have Texan nationalists who consider themselves as real Americans because they value right-wing libertarianism, no income taxes, and strict views on immigration. I mean, Allen West, the chairman of the Texas GOP has been floating the idea of Texas seceding from the country when their last-ditch effort to overthrow the election results in the four states of Georgia, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania that flipped to Biden by a slim margin in the 2020 US Presidential election didn't go in their favor in the conservative majority Supreme Court which three of the six conservative judges handpicked by Trump turned down their case when Ken Paxton, the Texas state AG basically lacked the legal standing to make the case heard. Despite this, the Texas GOP's case for secession may have hit a roadblock due to the recent winter storm that put Texas to a complete blackout due to its heavy reliance on privatization and lack of federal oversight might curtail that pipedream. Also the recent culture wars and sort of negative attention of the GOP ignoring the crisis to focus on rolling back voting rights, education, state history, trans rights, and abortion rights to name a few may impact the state's politics in future elections. But I digress.\n\nAnd then you have those on the far-right like Norwegian white supremacist terrorist Andres Behring Brevik who view Japan as a model for the West due to its opposition for multiculturalism, lack of left-wing political groups and alternatives, homogenized ethnic populations, commitment to tradition, and sometimes for those for the Japanese alt-right; glorification fo the past and strict immigration laws despite Japan is very much in itself contrary to the far-right's vision for a right-wing utopia due to its commitment for public healthcare and safety system that the far-right would hate especially for how Japan has handled covid, support for labor unions, environmentalism, and some growing acceptance for LGBTQ people and immigration, and most importantly, some neoliberal policies that they might dislike. I mean, Hayao Miyazaki's films are usually critiques of capitalism, colonialism, imperialism, fascism and then be supportive of environmentalism, social mobility, labor unions, feminism, and equality.\n\nAs you can see, defining what is and what is not the West is a clusterfuck by epic proportions. They even say Marxism is against Western civilization despite being a Western ideology created by a bunch of left-wing Hegelians who loved and critiqued Hegel."

I'm disabled and in a great deal of pain and just want a distraction without any political message one way or another. When I could not find one, I started searching online asking for suggestions - to see if anyone else out there was asking the same thing. \n\nI came across your post and thought, finally... Expecting to see respectful suggestions - while there may have been a few - the comments to your very non-offensive simple question absolutely shocked me - not only is it difficult to find Movie entertainment that does not have some political lesson or point of view one way or another, it appears as though even the question is politically incorrect!\n\nIt does not appear as if your question was answered here to your satisfaction, but I don't want to make any assumptions - God forbid I say the wrong thing here - oops I'm sorry, I just used the G word I'm sure I offended someone. \n\nI'm not an extremely political person and have views that fall to the left and to the right and somewhere in between - but when someone is ill or in pain... Or even for other reasons, it's not too much to ask or to seek out an option for entertainment that does not make some sort of statement or support one political agenda or another - it's not too much to ask or search out and hour or two of quality storytelling... \n\nIt's very sad reading some of these answers - I would have been better off just choosing a movie to watch or living with the frustration of not being able to find something as innocuous as a good story ... Now I am not just frustrated - I'm actually angry on some level. I am not an elderly person - I am not an unaware person - and evidently just for asking this question many people may consider me privileged, even though they know nothing about me or my background -I'm just so shocked and saddened that I had to reply here. And my frustration, anger and a touch of sadness is not because I cannot find a movie, it is the comments to a simple question / opinion / view that has just blown my mind. Moving on... I guess I will have to look for a movie that has both women and men - as well as neutral gender beings - black, white, brown, Muslim, Catholic, atheists, agnostics, wiccan, That supports both abortion and right to choose - that makes sure everyone who is not black or brown apologizes for their privilege - I will make sure that every movie I watch has a disclaimer that anyone watching the movie that is white or that is a male entity is privileged and perhaps The preamble to the entire movie or story should have disclaimers of every kind - but at the same time, if I'm privileged enough to be able to watch a movie at all, if I'm privileged enough to have eyes and to have ears and to have hands and to have a device of any kind to watch a movie on, perhaps I am too privileged to give myself permission to watch any movie at all",

It felt weird watching the teaser and see Sturridge characterized as Dream with normal human eyes. I mean, his eyes is so iconic its even mentioned a few times in the comics.\n\nI havent seen the other Endless... I dont really know if I should.\n\nAlso for those who want to scream 'Racist' or Incel:\n\n1. I come from a mestizo Venezuela  family. Literally my mom is dark skinned. My granpa (basically my father, my bio dad just wasnt there) was black, my uncle (also like a real father) is also black. I grew up and was raised by them.\n\n2. Generally speaking I am bothered when producers, directors o casting directors change so much the appearence or personality of an iconic or well defined character. In any medium. But I still wait and give a chance for the characters grow on me. Like Dr. Manhattan in the HBO The Watchmen. I thought the actor nailed it.\n\nSo I'm dissapointed in this characterization for sure. And not solely for Death's actress because to be honest and I know this sounds silly, but Dream without his full dark void eyes annoys me more than Death or any other character.

(cue always has been meme)\n\nWhat you probably are annoyed with is the spectacle of party politics under faux \"democracy\" (dictatorship of capital). It has a way of being extremely annoying and intense, while also not producing anything meaningful whatsoever.\n\nThe reason I say this is not to be annoying and pedantic about wording, it's because you can't realistically ban politics, you can only try to ban *explicit* politics. People who want to push a viewpoint are still going to find a way to push it, they'll just have to be a little more subtle. Consider the example you gave about Nigerian Movies. It paints a picture of the entirety of Nigerian cinema not understanding basic things like how medical care works. Is that \"not political\"? It makes Nigeria look bad while coming across as an innocent description of someone's experience and could affirm already racist beliefs on this disproportionately western imperialist website.\n\nI appreciate that what you're trying to do here is difficult, it just bothers me when people think that politics can be summed up as party slap fights in capitalist countries and that they are free of any agenda as long as they remove that kind of content. As if we can just live in bubbles of enjoyment where systems and ideologies that cause suffering are not real, rather than a more realistic approach, which is to take an ideological stand and direct entertainment-related energies into backing up those ideologies. Which is what people already do unconsciously, when they're not being explicitly \"political\"... I am just asking people to be more conscious about what they're already doing.

Truthfully, I hate Romney, but I truly loathe Obama for all of the negativity that has been brought on this country in so many ways. Neither party is good, but sometimes you are forced to vote for the lesser of two evils. And not voting is not a solution. If you feel that of the two candidates, one of them would not harm the country nearly as much as the other, it is your responsibility to vote for who you think is better suited for the job. Thats part of being an American. Thousands of people have died in the pursuit of the right to vote. Don't throw it away so quickly just because you don't like the candidates.

                "Now look, I don't like a lot of what Ben Shapiro says, but I have listened to a lot of what he's said because I like to stay informed, and I was curious about this post's phrasing on the first thing. I went to the source and found the single reference they cited. Its an hour-long podcast of his. He goes over the fact that Alfie Evans has a degenerative brain disease, and his parents want to take him from the Great Brittain hospital that he is in to an Italian one that can has experimental treatment that could help him, but the hospital is declining that and had shut off Alfie's life support, reportedly against his parents' will (should be noted that Alfie is a new-born baby). Nothing about not letting someone who is terminally ill (with say cancer or some other incurable and painful disease) deciding to end their life sooner, rather than later, with euthanasia. He even goes on to say that there is no question between someone dying painfully, and instead choosing to let them die more peacefully with euthanasia. Like I said, I don't agree with a lot of what he says, but to falsely circulate this stuff into the circle-jerk to defame the opposing party is what the other guys do, and isn't any less pathetic when you do it.",

I understand the satire, but I think some explanation is required to avoid unnecessary slandering of a man with opinions and to open the minds to civil conversations. \n\n1: In the case of the terminally ill person, that would encourage the people around you to agree the the death of an innocent person.  Most of the time it would be doctors doing the procedures.  I know several current and future doctors that are prepared to quit their jobs if assisted suicide becomes a thing because Docs become docs not to take but to save lives.  Forcing another to kill you, even when you want to die, is not okay.\n\n2: The Death penalty is in response to incredibly violent activities that have resulted in mass destruction of lives.  I agree that the death penalty needs to be reformed, but some people should not be allowed to stay in society, prison or other.  There are cases of it going wrong or being used on the wrong people, but that just means that there needs to be reform and regulations, not outright abolishment.  \n\nTL:DR: Summarizing these two beliefs into yes and no statements and then calling it a facepalm is **good satire and funny**, but explanations are required to avoid slandering of the guy speaking.

To that end, we have added an additional text section below the rules clarifying what we will remove and what we will not remove under the banner of **Overt Political Content**. We're also including them below since you're already here.\n\n**OVERT POLITICAL CONTENT INCLUDES:**\n\n* Tweets, pictures, or videos of politicians being politicians.\n* Posts of any type regurgitating talking points of politicians.\n* Posts that specifically attack a political party\n* Political violence or the advocacy of political violence\n* Talk of overthrowing or subverting governments or governmental processes\n\n**OVERT POLITICAL CONTENT DOES NOT INCLUDE:**\n\n* Regular citizens being obviously stupid about politics or civics\n* People wearing political clothing while being stupid\n* People wearing obviously stupid political clothing\n* People being stupid while protesting\n\nSimply put, we want the focus to be on the stupid, not on the politics.\n\nWe feel that this clarification will make it easier to understand what we're trying to achieve here. For overt political content, we invite you to post it over at r/politicalfacepalm!\n\nIf you have questions or feedback let us know in the comments below!",

In response the USA set up blockades that prevented pretty much any imports / exports from getting in or out of japan. After the Japanese government and US government failed to find a solution the Japanese  felt they were left with little choice but to attack the US naval base in an attempt to break the blockade and this ended up drawing both countries in to the war.\n\nIt always came across to me that the USA forced the hand of the Japanese into such desperate action so as to get support from the American population to join the war as at the time there was little support for joining due to many still adjusting to life after ww1.

True equality is IMPOSSIBLE.  However sharing in the profits of ones work is very very very much possible, and much better for the economy as a whole. \n\nConsidering a standard person produces $1.30 in economic value, compared to a wealthy person who only contributes about $0.30 cents or so.  It's because they have so much wealth they can't spend it in normal ways.  Thus turning them into horde dragons negatively impacting the economy for every dollar they make they give back $0.30 in return.  \n\nWealthy people don't create jobs.  Wealthy people don't create innovation.  ALL they do is prey on those who do.  \n\nGreat example is the Ipod.  Everyone thinks Steve Jobs invented the Ipod, but he didn't.

Fascists will gleefully consume each other to radicalize their movement even further towards the end goal of domination.  \nPeople make a critical mistake when dealing with fascists. They assume they must have a standard political goal, benefit certain constitutes or achieve specific political ends.\n\nPower is the goal of fascists. Power above all else over others.  \nThat is why in media they project that:   \n\"**Everyone** ***else*** **wants to control** ***your life*** **and thus they're the** ***enemy***.\"\n\nIsolation is always the goal of fascists. Make people afraid to live their lives freely.  \nMake people alone. Make people scared. Make people boxed and easily manipulated by their propaganda. All abuser tactics to be aware of also.\n\nIt's projection all the way down. Our freedoms are their enemy. They just project their true feelings about usurping power onto the people they hate most. There is very little nuance in their propaganda. Everything revolves around the same shtick:  \n\"Person A, is in a conspiracy with group B to take all your freedoms away because they're against our *traditional values*, we must stop them or else they will eradicate our culture and way of life!\"  \n\n\nIt's exactly what they want to do and it is the perfect development of a defense against their way of thinking. Fascists are abusive by nature and use [DARVO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARVO) extensively.\n\n>Deny, Attack, and Reverse Victim and Offender\n\nWell practiced abusers and especially successful fascists use this very effectively to shift the narrative every time they are called out. It's never *their fault* because they're actually the **victim**.\n\nFascists morph into anything that can usurp power. That's why the narrative suits them so well to distance themselves from other fascists. Anyone that fails at taking power from others weren't ***real*** alt-right people *aka* fascists. And so they can be like \"see they weren't **really** right wing, they claimed to be **X!**\"  \n\n\nThe last thing a fascist wants, is to be definable. It's why hitler by necessity has to be **\"far-left\"**\n\nDefine fascists by what they do, rather than who they associate with because they'll never claim to be associated with a failed fascist until after they've won control over enough media to change them back into a celebrated hero.",

How is it her fault if she got raped? How is it the woman's fault that there are so many sick fucking dudes out there and access to pornography and the dark web is so easy these days.

And they don't give a damn about the kid once it's born. What a child takes in during his early life is so crucial to his development and into the adult they will one day become. \n\nAs a 36 year old male myself,  I can tell you that NO MAN can ever understand what a woman goes through during a pregnancy. Imagine asking her to endure a pregnancy that she was forced to have beyond her will because of some sick disgusting dirt bag of man who raped her. She didn't make that decision. Maybe she didn't want to have kids and wanted to live her own life. It would be different if she made a decision to have unprotected sex without considering the consequences but for fucks sake, if a woman is raped it shouldn't even be an argument! \n\nIt is a difficult situation I will admit and let me say for the record that I am not a supporter of abortion itself. Taking precautions and using protection are very important and even then you should be prepared for the fact that protection CAN fail. I also believe that the majority of people never want to have to go through making that decision because it is a life at stake.

Pregnancy alone doesn\u2019t constitute a life-threatening disease, though. There needs to be complications with the pregnancy. \n\nRape is the muddiest area of this conversation to me. Of course a rape victim is already going through enough and shouldn\u2019t be forced to raise the child of the person who raped her. But if we give an exception for rape, then there will be a significant increase in false rape allegations in order to fulfill abortion requirements. I\u2019m really torn up on that and just defer to rape victims can get abortions with minimal verification. If that\u2019s the loophole people exploit to get abortions in a pro-life state, that\u2019s not the worst thing in the world. \n\nThe reason I\u2019m pro life is half personal and half logical. Before I was born, my mom\u2019s doctor misdiagnosed with downsyndrome and told my mom \u201cif you wanna abort you have to do it now.\u201d My mom\u2019s was strict pro choice and was offended by the suggestion, but I live a pretty scary reality where if my mom was more suggestible then I would not be here. I often wonder how many people aren\u2019t alive because a misguided decision from their mother, or even worse, a decision for convenience sake. \n\nThe way I see it, life begins the second you\u2019re aware of it. A fetus is not a clump of cells, it\u2019s a developing human life, and we all know it. The second a pregnancy is confirmed, there is a baby in there, and aborting it is akin to killing it. This doesn\u2019t mean life starts at contraception. Think of it like schroedinger\u2019s baby. The second you\u2019re done having sex, schroedinger\u2019s fetus is made, and it\u2019s neither alive or dead til the pregnancy is confirmed. This gives moral leeway to birth control and plan B as preventative measures for pregnancy. \n\nNote: I am stuck in my ways and won\u2019t be changing my views here, just hoping to give some perspective from a pro-lifer that isn\u2019t a religious nut so y\u2019all can better understand the logic of the other side.",
