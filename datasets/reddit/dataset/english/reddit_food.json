I usually just vomit for an entire day and it\u2019s miserable.  Lots of people I met said they don\u2019t do this so I now actively try to vomit less after my body was done expelling everything in my body.  The breathing thing is the only thing that worked.

            "selftext": "Edit: ON his birthday, really should have spell checked before posting. \n\nI (18f) have been dating my boyfriend, John (20m) for a little under a year. We have a pretty toxic free relationship but there\u2019s quite a bit of tension when it comes to me being vegetarian. I\u2019ve been vegetarian since 11 and I have very strict morals around it. The one thing John has a problem with is me refusing to spend my money on meat. Ever since I started making my own money, I swore to myself that I would never spend a cent of it on meat. On our dates, we usually spilt the bill and sometimes he pays for it all. I told him if he orders something meat-free, I\u2019d happily pay for both of us but he never does. When he pays for my food, it\u2019s when I\u2019ve spend money on the activity. Normally concerts and festivals. That\u2019s me paying \u20ac120+ on tickets and him spending maybe \u20ac50 on food\n\nHis birthday was a few days ago and we went out for dinner at his favourite fancy restaurant. He got the most expensive steak they had along with a side salad and a bottle of wine. When we finished our food, I asked the waiter to spilt the bill and John looked at me shocked. He asked if I was joking and I said no. Then he told me he thought I was going to pay since it was his birthday and he didn\u2019t budget for the meal. I asked him why he thought I\u2019d pay since I\u2019ve been very clear about my rule but he couldn\u2019t give me a reason other than it being his birthday.\n\nI told him I\u2019d pay for the wine and the side salad, but he\u2019d need to pay for the steak. He was furious with me and stormed off to the bathroom. I paid for my meal, the wine and the salad and waited for him to come back. He didn\u2019t. After waiting for 20 minutes, I left.\n\nI found him sitting on a bench near where we parked the car. I asked him why he left and reminded him he needed to pay. He looked shocked when I said that and asked me if I didn\u2019t pay. I told him I\u2019d paid for everything but the meat and he lost it. He started yelling at me, telling me I was selfish, that I needed to grow up. I stayed calm and told him he needed to go back and pay. He scoffed and walked away. I ended up driving home without him.\n\nNow he\u2019s saying it\u2019s my fault that he can\u2019t show his face in his favourite restaurant since he dined and ditched. It\u2019s a pretty small restaurant so he\u2019d 100% be recognised and kicked out.\n\nSo, aita?\n\nEDIT: To the people commenting about me not \u201ctreating\u201d him on his birthday, yes, I did. I even dipped into my savings for his present.\n\nEDIT 2: I did not \u201ctake him out\u201d for dinner. He was the one that suggested it.",

As far as I can describe it, it\u2019s like slurping a big ball of fleshy snot out of a fishy ass shell.\n\nEdit: \nI just wanted to mention the fact that, some of you are being negative, and in a way uncivil, I\u2019m open to reading your opinions about seafood and this post in general, but don\u2019t waste your time writing stuff like, oh his post history, 5 year old, chicken nuggets.\n\nYeah I have addressed a few comments like that, but I won\u2019t from now on, it\u2019s pointless explaining myself, if your offended, then your gonna be offended. I can\u2019t change that. But don\u2019t forget, there is no reason to be offended, bc this is literally someone\u2019s opinion about food.\n\nEdit 2: hoooly shit, I just woke up, Thank you guys for your comments, awards, upvotes and downvotes!

Probably because I made a new throwaway and received a lot of attention I messaged reddit and the issue was quickly resolved. So that is why the last post was removed(it's back now). I'm not sure what the rules on updates are here\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nA lot of people wanted an update I wanted to see my roommate in a more positive light. I tend to try to see the best in people but reading the replies and his recent actions have opened my eyes. I never took him too seriously because he's a pretty harmless little guy in my perspective. There is a big difference in how he lashes out at me compared to his gf. He's gotten big tough with me in text form but only mildly upset when I see him in person. I have taken a step back and looked at anything I could have done to provoke him(not excusing his behavior) And while I don't believe I am in the wrong for being hospital and hosting a guest. If a 75 year old man we're staying with us. I would treat him the same as I have treated his gf.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nI do realize that he is not from the south. I was told by others in school that women outside the south don't enjoy being called \"ma'am.\" however, I've never seen a lady get angry if I did call her ma'am up here. I call women of all ages \"dear\" or \"darling\" and I could see how that could be seen as flirtatious even though it's just part of how I speak. Now that he knows I have seen him in his \"true form\" he doesn't even try to act the way he did before. I sent his gf screenshots of the texts he's sent and told her the things he's said. I'm not sure if she is leaving or staying but I've let her know and told her to let me know if she needs any help. I don't plan on moving any time soon as I enjoy having room for a grill and smoker and a garage. He told me he's looking for new places to live and will potentially go back to his parents. I make enough working at a restaurant to afford the rent alone. I would like more going into savings but I'm not worried financially for the time being.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nI am flattered and overwhelmed by all the positive replies. Bout a hundred of you told me to thank my mom so I sure will. I grew up working in hospitality with my mom and siblings. My dad is the one that instilled respect into me. He never felt emasculated even when my mom's business ended up making more than he does. They just save their money from their jobs and go on vacation a lot. Thank you for all the kindness and offers for adoption/jobs/relationships/friendships lol. A lot of people wanting gumbo & chicken recipes. Too much to type out but I use curry powder in a lot of things to give it some good flavor(that's how my mom does it). White pepper is essential for that good good fried chicken flavor\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(original post)\n\nI(21m) am from the south. I grew up in New Orleans and Texas. My mom runs a catering business and the majority of clients were either at home in Louisiana or in Texas. I add this to say that I grew up cooking and helping my mom cook for the business. I was frying chicken and catfish when I could reach the stove and making gumbo and buttermilk biscuits at a very young. I'm currently in culinary school right now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've lived in a rented house on the east coast with my roommate(22m) for a year and a half. He's not a friend or anything. We just linked up because we both needed roommates in the area. He's good to live with and we watch shows and movies together. We hang out and go out for drinks sometimes. I always make friends easy because of being from the south and doing customer service related things since I was a kid. I know how to talk and charm and listen to folk despite being naturally more in the introverted spectrum. My roommate has been seeing his girlfriend(20m) for like 6 months. I've met her before and seen her in passing. Roommate and his gf had a 2 week break from school things. She still lives at her parents so she decided to stay here the whole two weeks.  I was just doing things as I would normally do. It got weird at first when I was about to go mow the lawn and the roommate stopped me and said he wanted to mow(I usually always mow.) A couple of days later I was outside washing my car. I asked both of them if they wanted me to do theirs. She looked like she was going to agree but he looked at her angrily so they declined.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI cook pretty frequently at home as well and usually let my roommate have some. So any time I'd make some I would say that they could have some and this would get him pissed. Weeks prior when she was here and we were all talking. She mentioned this specific kind of cheesecake that she really likes. So I made and sent out a group text that everyone could have it. My roommate got upset. I don't see anything as overstepping a boundary as this is how I treat him and all guests. The other day he told me how annoying it was to hear his gf talk about \"how good your roommate can fresh baked bread is.\" I'm not trying to make him look bad or anything. This is simply how i was raised. If I bake two loaves of bread I'm gonna leave it out for the house to eat.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT- The cheesecake is just common courtesy type thing to me. When his parents come over i make pound cake because they like it. If a guest is coming you get/make what they like. Nothing odd about picking up their favorite chips or making some tea when guests arrive. Just how I was raised\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT- Wow this has blown up. Just want to say we generally have a good roommate relationship. We're not best friends but it's friendly enough. The only change has been when his gf is here. So lol no I am not looking to for new roommates/to be adopted/or to move but thanks. Here is some more things that upset him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI went to the grocery store and asked if anyone needed anything\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was frying chicken and offered the first/best pieces out the oil to them\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI changed the oil to my own car\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI used a smoker in the backyard to make brisket\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI grill and smoke in the backyard and needed a piece of wood cut into a certain way to hold something up. I cut and nailed some wood together in the garage.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFeels like I can't even exist while she is here\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFINAL EDIT- I tend to see the good and best in people. So I was not seeing him as being very insecure and was trying to look at this in a more positive light. But he just texted me and said that I  greet his gf in too kind of a way and it's annoying that I say \"be safe\" when she leaves the house(I say this to him and everyone when they they tell me they are going somewhere). He sent me a long text detailing it's bad that I look her in the eyes when she is talking to me??? Maybe it is time for a new roommate\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

As long as we've known him, this friend has kept to a very strict diet, which has almost always led to us eating over at his place, but he is an excellent cook so I've never minded. We have not, however, seen him since both of our children were infants.\n\nFor dinner, we were served salmon with quinoa and arugula. My son is very mild for a 5-year-old - he throws tantrums very rarely and is the opposite of a picky eater, but I could tell from how he was acting that he was not vibing with this meal. He was picking at his plate, shuffling food, and while he did try the salmon, he didn't seem to like it. I asked him if he was happy with his dinner and he said no, he wasn't. \n\nI basically said, \"Haha, kids, right?\" and asked if there was anything else for my son to eat. My wife's friend said that his daughter just eats whatever he makes, so he doesn't keep \"kid food\" around the house. \n\nMy wife said it was fine, our son would be fine. While he is a mild kid, he definitely gets hangry and this was the beginning of our night, so we anticipated being there for an additional hour or two. I said that our son needed to eat so he'd have energy to play and apologized, saying I'd be gone for just a few minutes, picking something up for our kid. My wife's friend seemed irked, but said he'd try and keep my plate warm.\n\nI was gone for about 30 minutes, came back with a Happy Meal - ordered extra fries in case his daughter wanted any, which she was not allowed to have. By the time I was back, dinner was winding down. My son ate his meal, we had dessert, and he went off to play with his friend.\n\nIt was definitely a hiccup in the night, but things went fine. We had a good time, but my wife was definitely cold with me. When we got home (3 hours after dinner), she told me that I was an ass at dinner for no reason. I pointed out that if I hadn't gotten our son dinner, he would've been a monster the entire way home, to which she replied that we would've left earlier. I said I was just looking to solve the problem as it happened and that if her friend had been more accomodating, we wouldn't have been in the situation in the first place.\n\nShe got offended on his behalf and we decided to just go to bed because we clearly were not getting anywhere. It's been two days since, things are still stilted between us, and I'm not sure where I went wrong.\n\nAITA for leaving dinner to get my son food, even though dinner was served?",

I've got about 1000 followers, it's just a hobby for me but I have made friends with some other bloggers and we like to go out and get pics together and try new restaurants. I prefer doing this with my foodie girls because my boyfriend HATES it, and will go out of his way to take a big bite of food or mess up his plate with his fork before I can snap any pics, and he rolls his eyes when I take pics of my own food so I pretty much stopped bothering when we went out together.\n\nMoney has been tight lately because of some medical bills, so I haven't been able to go out to eat with my foodie girls and the infrequent date with my boyfriend is the only chance I get to eat out. I had to sit him down and have a \"Look, just let me enjoy things,\" conversation with him and told him I was gonna take pics of my own food when we went out and could he please just not be immature about it. And since we alternate who pays for dates, I told him I would appreciate it if he could spare the 30 seconds for me to snap a pic of the appetizer + his meal on nights that I was paying, and I got a sort of half-hearted \"do whatever you want\" confirmation.\n\nSunday was my turn to pay, and he let me take a pic of the appetizer with minimal fussing. But then when the entrees came out, I went to snap a pic of his and he messed it up with his fork. Then he reached over and stirred up MY pasta to also ruin the photo of my own meal! I was so pissed off by that that I refused to pay his half at the end of the meal, which pissed him off because he said he wouldn't have ordered a cocktail if he knew that I was gonna skip my turn. He says I owe him one because I don't get to just decide not to pay according to our agreement after we've already ordered.",

            "selftext": "I posted this before in a different sub but I figured it would be appreciated here and I have more things to add\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOriginal post-\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI posted this in another forum but received a lot of comments telling me to post it here as well.\n\nI(26f) live in a rented house with a single mother(30f) and her son(6m). I had another person living with me but they moved out and the mother moved in. I don't mind living with her and her kid. It's fine and we kind of do our own thing. I spend a lot of time at my boyfriend's place or working. Our work schedules collide so we really don't interact much but when we do it's fine. No issue there.\n\nI want to start with saying that she clearly struggles financially but I don't think it's an excuse. I don't make lots of money either.\n\nHowever I've noticed that my food would go missing or portions would be taken from it. I assumed it was her kid so I asked her if she'd stop him from eating my food. I was calm about it and she just said she would. It didn't really upset me when it first started. It started getting annoying when I'd get home from work and expect to have a meal's worth of leftovers in the fridge only to see it picked through or just gone. I kept bringing it up and she started getting annoyed with me bringing it up.\n\nJust from observing them I realized that neither of them ever eat vegetables. And judging by the food that would get picked through and the food that would be untouched. Anything with green in it was avoided. Orange chicken would be gone but chicken and broccoli would be untouched. So I started putting vegetables in EVERYTHING. I find vegetables to be delicious. And anything green or not a potato does not get eaten. So I could mix some bell peppers into the food and it would be fine. I make a big portion of vegetables pretty frequently anyway so I just started putting it in everything I eat. If I had leftover mashed potatoes i'd pour green beans in and mix it up. If I had leftover cheesy/bacon fries I'd pour broccoli all over it and mix it in.\n\nUsually my homemade stuff has vegetables in it but I started making sure everything did. I made a pot of mac n cheese(the kid's favorite thing) and poured in roasted brussel sprouts. Which is actually delicious to me and I'm eating more vegetables so it's a win win. She had been seeming annoyed but we were all home when I made the pot of mac n cheese. She was in the living room and saw me get out the brussel sprouts and was like \"what are you going to do with that?\" and I poured them in. She said I was being greedy and annoying. I just said \"I like brussel sprouts\" and that was it. She said \"we need food\" and I told her to go get some. Or stop buying only prepackaged things and your money will go further.\n\nI think she sees this as some big act of revenge but I just simply want to be able to eat my food.\n\nAlso want to add that the sharing is not the issue. It's expecting to have food there and it's not. So often I'd be working a long day and get home expecting to have a meal's worth of food and it all be gone. Or I wake up in a rush and had my food ready to eat in the morning only to find it gone. So now I have to skip breakfast. If she would simply text sometimes \"hey is it okay if we eat \\*food item\\*\" I would know and know to make other plans. I would stop for food or know I have to whip something up when I get home. Also I think eating the LAST of someone else's food is crazy and rude. If someone makes a big pot of something and you ask for a serving, sure. But if someone made something and there is one serving left and you eat it without permission that is evil as hell.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUPDATE\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I have been steadfast with putting vegetables in everything. I've put vegetables in things I've never even thought of. This has carried on and the mom calls me a jerk but will not verbalize that she is eating my food. She just sees me making a lasagna and adding celery and bellpeppers in the layers of fumes off to the side. The only thing I can't add vegetables to is snacks like chips or if I bake brownies or cookies. However this is easily remedied by putting baked goods in a tupperware and keeping them in my room. Same with chips. As I have previously stated the sharing is not the issue. Recently the kid knocked on my door and asked if he would have a bag of microwave popcorn. I said yes and gave him one. All of this would be way less annoying if she'd just text \"hey can I have some of this\" and waited for my response before just helping herself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI do feel for the mom because she clearly struggles with cooking and trying new foods. She is older than me and winces at the thought of biting into anything green. And it is spreading to her kid but it's no excuse. A few days ago I was making taco meat out of ground beef and like usual she was looking without looking. She was off to the side watching my every move but trying her to look normal. I made a dish the day before that involved saut\u00e9ed mushrooms and cut up peppers. So when the meat was almost ready I opened the fridge and she freaked when she saw me holding the mushrooms. She said \"(son's name) hates mushrooms!\" and I just poured them in the pan and mixed along with the cut up peppers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis caused her to react in a way I'd never seen from her before. She was yelling and stomping around the kitchen while the kid just watched. Felt bad for the kid to have to see his mom like that. People were worried about her tampering with my food. I don't think she's the kind to do that but if she did I would report that right away. She was flipping out but she didn't snatch my food or knock anything over. She was opening and slamming cabinets and it was all very silly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen she started going off about how she is going to get the authorities involved. I just told her \"sure\" and that she needs to relax. She seemed genuinely upset and stressed and I told her that I understand being a single mom is hard but she needs to use her government assistance more responsibly. She'll come home with cold mac n cheese, sushi, and chicken from the grocery store prepared foods and blow all if it on that. I suggested food pantries and buying ingredients that last a while like potatoes. She said I was being condescending and I always have food to eat.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is to address the \"just make a portion of your food and set it aside for her and the kid.\" I do NOT make enough money to regularly feed two other people. If every now and then she asked for some of my leftovers, sure. But this is a consistent thing that was happening. It's not simple as giving her leftovers that I \"won't eat anyway.\" If I make a pot of something I expect live off of that for the next few days. If it is eaten then MY money is messed up and I have to go shopping again and budget for more food. Wastes my time and money",

Two college kids who fell in love and decided to build a life together. I recently gave birth to a beautiful baby girl (14 weeks old) who's my entire world. I've suffered through 3 miscarriages and experienced several complications during pregnancy. I was on bed rest for 3 months and had to go through over 20 hours of labor before the doctors performed an emergency C-section. But our daughter was born healthy and happy and all that pain was worth it. \n\n\nI had gained about 30 pounds during my pregnancy. I was 5'7 121 pounds prior. After giving birth I gained another 10 pounds since I have been breastfeeding and my body has been craving calorie dense foods. Not junk food. Just 70% minimum cacao chocolate, stuff like plantain chips, meats, dairy, nuts, et cetera. The doctor told me that I should listen to my body's needs and feed myself whatever I feel like I need. \n\n\nMy husband has been helpful. He was happy when he learned the gender. Took care of me and accommodated all my needs during my bed rest. Post partum, however, he started to make up excuses to not help with the baby. He hasn't been as affectionate with our daughter as I had hoped he would be. \n\nHe made a few negative comments about my weight here and there. Like \"You're a bit chubby\", \"Today's a good day to work out and shed some pounds\". I was an extremely active woman who worked out 4-5x a week and indulged in dangerous and adventurous activities. But now I'm completely exhausted, I can barely get out of bed, I've collapsed 5 times, and I'm stressed out and at the same time I have to take care of our baby and the household. \n\nThe other day, my husband had already gone to work and I went to the kitchen and found all my food gone. Every single bag, box, package. Everything. I called him crying to inquire where all my food is and he told me that he threw everything out because I needed to start losing weight. I hung up on him and called my best friend so she could bring me some food that I needed from the store. \n\nAfterwards my husband came home and when he saw the food that she had brought, he threw everything outside and smashed everything with his foot. I was furious with him and I was screaming and yelling at him for being a selfish POS and he called me a \"f*cking cow\" while throwing some of the crushed packages at me and ended with punching a hole in the door. I called my brother who picked me and my baby up and I'm now staying at his place. His mother, sister, and even my own mother are all defending him and that I have to lose weight and apologize to him for my postpartum breakdown. \n\nI guess I'm just not sure if this is good grounds to file for divorce or should I listen to my mother? Is this how all men are wired?\n\n[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/15garrd/update_my_29f_husband_31m_threw_away_all_my_food/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=2)  **Aug 2, 2023**\n\nUPDATE: Thank you guys for the comments on my previous post. However, even though I really wanted to follow everyone's advice about weight, eating, and divorcing, my mother still got in my head and because I've always obeyed her I listened and went back to my husband. \n\nHe did say that he was sorry for calling my \"a f*cking cow\" but he said he was only being honest and said, and I quote \"Isn't honesty the most important foundation of a happy and healthy relationship?\". And I thought he was right. \n\nSo I started cutting back on my food and eating low calorie foods but problems almost immediately arose. My energy levels dropped and my milk supply diminished quickly. I must have collapsed at least 4 during that period and 3 days ago, at night, the baby was crying non-stop and my husband got angry and yelled at me to make her stop. I told him that I wasn't producing enough milk due to lack of food and he literally said \"Cows eat grass and produce gallons of milk. What are you, a meat cow?\". \n\n\nThat's when I decided to take my daughter while I was shushing her and letting her breastfeed whatever drops of milk I had there and once my husband fell asleep, I left the house and came to my best friend who welcomed me in and told me I can stay here as long as I need to. I didn't go to my brother because I didn't trust him anymore since he also told me that I should work things out with my husband. \n\n\nI already filed for divorce and cut off contact with his family and my own mother. My best friend and her fiance have been helping me a lot by taking care of my baby while I was resting and my best friend would bring whatever I needed from the store. My milk supply has returned to normal and I haven't collapsed once. I've probably had more rest for these 3 days than I've had in a month. \n\n\nI am going to attempt to get full custody and supervised visits from the father, but my best friend's fiance said that it might be difficult to do without evidence. And I do have at least some evidence because we of course have cameras outside our house and they recorded everything. It may not be enough but.. fingers crossed. But the reddit advice has helped me a lot and I appreciate all the help.\n\n**THIS IS A REPOST SUB - I AM NOT THE OOP**",

I guess my daughter was still hungry after eating all the food I packed (she just had a ADHD med change and I guess it peaked her appetite) and she went inside and ended up eating a bunch of food and my SIL lost it because it was \"all they had\" (they were having a pool party so everyone was outside and didn't see her take the food). Told my daughter to get outside. So I immediately leave work and come to investigate and find my SIL inside with her head in her hands. I ask what happened and she wouldn't even look at me. I start prying for an answer because my daughter is visibly upset and practically ran to the car when I got there. She snaps and says \"go ask you kid how much she fucking ate Chrissy, AFTER I told her not to touch what little food I had. Go!\" So I told her no, you tell me, you're the fucking adult. Well, she literally dumped out an entire full size packing box of empty containers. Cracker packs, like 4 fruit containers (strawberries, blueberries, raspberries and watermelon), pudding cups, bags of chips and an empty sandwich meat bag. It was a lot and I'm not saying it wasn't. But then she goes \"want to see what I have left to feed my fucking family?\" Opens her fridge and it was basically bare. Now, in no way am I condoning it because that was absolutely a lot of food but I still think it's fucked up that she made my daughter feel like shit about it. I told her my kid wouldn't be going back there at all and she said \"good. Your kid just knowingly took at least 3 fucking days worth of food from my kids mouths so I'd rather not see her anyways.\" My mom says I'm an AH because I knew my kid has a big appetite and didn't pack more food for her, which apparently makes this my fault and says that I should offer to buy them groceries, which I won't do. I guess she went grocery shopping for them following this.",

            "selftext": "Posted this on r/AmITheAsshole and people were telling me this sub would love it, so here it is. As the title says, my roommates are vegetarian, and they still always eat my food. Our lease is almost up and I\u2019m moving out in a couple weeks anyway. \n\nA couple weeks ago, I got some cheese bread from a pizza place and only had a few pieces. I left the rest in the fridge so I could have it when I got home from work the next day. Next day I get home, grab the box of cheese bread and open it, they left me ONE piece. Mind you, I ate only a few pieces the previous day so I had about more than half remaining.\n\nI asked if they ate it and they admitted to it because they were \u201cdrunk\u201d. They always just eat my food if it can fit their vegetarian diet, and they never ask me. Just a few months ago, I bought 10 boxes of Mac & Cheese cause they were on sale 10 for $10. They ate 8 boxes and I only had 2. That was supposed to be a last resort option for me for when I didn\u2019t have enough money or didn\u2019t feel like making food. AND, they never once offered me any of my food when they made it. \n\nSo today, I just went and got some pizza, bread & wings. I already know they\u2019re gonna eat the pizza and just take the meat off, however, I ended up getting stuffed cheese bread & I asked if they could put pepperoni inside of it. The restaurant agreed. \n\nSo now, I\u2019m just waiting until my roommates get home, eat my shit without telling me just so I can enjoy the satisfaction of telling them that they ate meat. \n\nDon\u2019t eat my food if you\u2019re not gonna ask. Fuck around=find out\n\nEDIT: for those blowing up my DM\u2019s wanting an update, they did end up eating the bread but it was while I was sleeping, so I had no chance to confront them. I\u2019m currently on my way to work. Will update more tonight at about 9PM EST.",

Not refrigerating food promptly (from the store or as leftovers)\n\n3. Allowing pets on counters and not cleaning them before cooking\n\n4. Using severely expired food - EDIT: lots of people are talking about expiration dates, which is not what I meant at all. Those can be guidelines. Use the milk 5 days past the use by date if it smells fine. The issue I've seen multiple times is people using expired/rancid/visibly or odor-ly wrong food. Like YEARS past the stamped date and also clearly gone bad.\n\n5. Using dirty utensils (either they put it in their mouth and back in or are not careful about cleaning kitchen scissors, etc).\n\nIt's a horror show of contamination and germs in many home kitchens.",

His gf is currently pregnant with him in 4 months.\n\nMy brother asked to bring his girlfriend for dinner in order to catch up and I said sure, why not. However the moment she entered my house she started complaining about the smell of the steak I was making and said just the smell alone makes her nauseous and she can't eat this. I tried to suggest an alternative, but she was dead set on Chinese food and ended up sending my brother to the nearest mall in order to get her some. I thought that would be the end of it, but after going to the bathroom and coming back, I caught her throwing my unfinished steak into the garbage. I asked her what the hell she was doing and said the smell was so strong she thought she'd end up throwing up on the floor and she needed to get rid of it and then started spraying a perfume from her purse in my kitchen. I was beyond furious at this point and sent her back to the living room and after my brother came back from the mall, I kicked both of them out with their Chinese food.\n\nMy brother tried to convince me to let them back and that I could make something else for the two of us and his gf was pretty much sobbing at this point, but I was dead set on kicking them both out. However my parents ended up being mad at me for apparently causing so much distress to my brother's pregnant gf. I told them that she literally threw away our dinner, but they said that I shouldn't have yelled at her or kicked them out as she's still just a teenager who's now getting influenced by her pregnancy hormones and that my outburst also caused problems in their relationship as she ended up sending my brother to sleep on the couch that night (even tho he literally defended her as well against me, so I have no clue how this is my fault).\n\nAITA for apparently not having enough tact to deal with a pregnant teenager ?\n\nEdit: Spelling.",

My brother (21M) and his girlfriend (19F) still live with our parents as they can't afford a place of their own. His gf is currently pregnant with my brother in 4 months.\n\nMy brother asked to bring his girlfriend for dinner in order to catch and I said sure, why not. However the moment she entered my house she started complaining about the smell of the steak I was making and said just the smell alone makes her nauseous and she can't eat this. I tried to suggest an alternative, but she was dead set on Chinese food and ended up sending my brother to the nearest mall in order to get her some. I thought that would be the end of it, but after going to the bathroom and coming back, I caught her throwing my unfinished steak into the garbage. I asked her what the hell she was doing and said the smell was so strong she thought she'd end up throwing up on the floor and she needed to get rid of it and then started spraying a perfume from her purse in my kitchen. I was beyond furious at this point and sent her back to the living room and after my brother came back from the mall, I kicked both of them out with their Chinese food.\n\nMy brother tried to convince me to let them back and that I could make something else for the two of us and his gf was pretty much sobbing at this point, but I was dead set on kicking them both out. However my parents ended up being mad at me for apparently causing so much distress to my brother's pregnant gf. I told them that she literally threw away our dinner, but they said that I shouldn't have yelled at her or kicked them out as she's still just a teenager who's now getting influenced by her pregnancy hormones and that my outburst also caused problems in their relationship as she ended up sending my brother to sleep on the couch that night (even tho he literally defended her as well against me, so I have no clue how this is my fault). \n\nAITA for apparently not having enough tact to deal with a pregnant teenager ?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I'm not surprised by her immaturity, and her snap decision to throw out perfectly good food. Clearly, she has some growing up to do. I can also surmise that part of her stupid decision has a lot to do with being pregnant also. I believe the term is pregnancy brain. It's basically your brain being overly taxed because there is simply a lot more that the brain is being asked to do because of the pregnancy. I consider myself a pretty intelligent lady, but even I made some pretty goofy choices that I never would have made if it weren't for being pregnant. I've never been that dotty before or since.

There are things that make me nauseous and made me nauseous when I was pregnant. Not once did I throw someone elses food away, nor did I send my hubby out to get something else. I just comprised and ate something else that was offered. For the smell, I went outside until the smell left the house. I get nauseous with Chinese food, hubby and the kids like it, so I deal with it so they can still have things they like. Then there was another power move she did by making her bf who stuck up for her sleep on the couch. It wasn't his fault, it was her fault. I would have been upset too if someone threw someone else's food away like that. She's just more mad that she didn't get her way. And sounds like your parents got mad cause they were hoping to have some quiet time with them gone for a while. Sad that they take it out on you.",

If the smell was that bad, she could have excused herself outside.  But she threw away your steak (I'm sorry... food is F-ING EXPENSIVE these days) and sprayed all her perfume all over?  No way.  She owes you to replace your steak, and I would not let her back in my house until it was done.\n\nPregnancy hormones make the food things and the nausea happen.

She could have at least ask for you to pack it away and put in the fridge for later so the smell wasn't to strong. She choose to be an asshole on purpose by chucking it out. If she didn't like it she could have sat outside or went home. \n\nI am guessing this is the first grandkid. So your parents and brother are treating her like a queen so she thought she could do what ever she wants. She seems to think she is entitled to be right and do whatever and play the pregnancy card.

Your best bet would have been to speak to your brother and advise that'd be best for them to go.

You were willing to accommodate. You've picked up steaks for everyone ffs, who doesn't like steak. She even turned down your other food, but you were fine with her bringing in her own. She binned your food without even asking if you were done. I'd be raging too.

Your brother going to get her Chinese food is a really nice thing for him to do. \n\nThat being said, she had no right to just throw away your food like that. She could have stepped outside or opened a window or anything or maybe just say \"you know what, I'm not feeling steaks tonight, the smell is making me sick, let's call it a noght and reschedule\". Your brother saying \"you could make something else\" is ignoring the issues that she wasted YOUR food that you were preparing. \n\nI'd say it could have been handled better by all parties, but  she was out of line throwing your food away so NTA.",

            "selftext": "I say this with a lot of hesitation but my SIL, her husband and their child are all severely obese. Both SIL and her husband are over 300lbs and their daughter, 12, is easily pushing 200. The type of people to buy a smoker and giant chest freezer for $3k+ but fail to pay their mortgage/land tax and ask the family to help them out and when they are called out on it, it's met with a \"making sure my family is fed is my top priority\". Not saying it shouldn't be a priority but when you're feeding 3 people enough food for 10 people a day, it's absolutely an issue. \n\nLast year we extended the invite to them twice and both times they ate food so quickly that a lot of people didn't even know there was food available. I vividly remember them putting 3 hamburgers, 4 hotdogs and damn near half a container of pasta salad on their plates and still going up for seconds and thirds. I wish I were kidding but I'm not. The next time around, I bought more food and they ended up taking all the leftovers without even asking and without anyone's knowledge until after the fact, when my kids wanted more food and everything was taken (dish and all) and they had been the only ones who left.\n\nSo this year I didn't invite them. I can't afford to feed them and quite frankly, I don't want to feed them. I don't want to have a beach day and have to run out to the store midway through to get my kids something to eat when I know I packed and cooked plenty to last a day. So I invited everyone but them. The day went great. We weren't hungry after for once. SIL caught wind, which I expected, and she immediately said \"we would have fucking liked a family meal too\" so I simply said \"I can't afford to feed you\". She asked what I meant and as nicely as possible, I explained what I did above. Now I'm being called every name in the book for fat shaming and embarrassing her.",

I have explained it to him many times: \"Steve, do not give her anything, she is only allowed to have cat food.\" I have had to do this literally every time he has been in my house with food. Nevertheless, Steve persists.\n\nI come home yesterday and Steve and my husband are throwing darts in the garage. Then they go out and come back with some fast food, including a meal for me. I turn my back for one moment to get some plates, and when I turn back around I see Steve offering my cat a piece of GARLIC BREAD. I yell at him to STOP IT already, grab his whole meal and dump it in the trash. He calls me a bitch and reaches for my meal, I grab it away and yell at him to get the hell away from my cat until he's learned some manners. They go back out to the garage and I overhear my husband trying to reason with him a bit but he's not having it, and he storms out. Steve is pissed, husband is understanding where I'm at with him always trying to feed the cat, but also annoyed and says I had no right to throw out his meal. I really don't want to see Steve in my house at all any time soon, but at the very least I don't want him here with any food until he learns to keep it to himself.",

Like, literally every time I see this kid he's wolfing down food. You wouldn't think it because he's super lank, but I guess he's at that age where it's normal, I've been there. \n\nAt dinner last night we had a nice meat loaf and some mac and cheese. I gave everyone big servings, and the other two kids were happy with it, but naturally Erik wanted more. I told him he should probably just save room for dessert and he did. But he still wanted to eat another serving of dinner after dessert. I wanted to save some food for our dinner tomorrow, so I told him he couldn't have anymore. \n\nBut my wife (26f) went over my head and told Erik he could have more if he wanted, and he went on to eat so much he almost instantly fell asleep on the couch, where my other nephews were playing video games.\n\nIt was overall a really good day but I was miffed that my wife went over my head over the food thing, and when we went to bed I told her I felt like what we'd served was reasonable. She argued that since Erik is a guest he can have as much food as he wants, and she can always buy more (she usually stocks the kitchen). She thinks I'm being a jerk for thinking I can control how much we do or don't serve and that it's weird I would have told Erik he can't have another serving without at least checking with her first.\n\nI haven't been able to stop thinking about it since. Was I being the asshole? I think I was in the right, why not save some dinner. Erik already had a lot of food as it is.",

(I have read a lot of the YTA comments, most of them said we are both TA) And she was definitely being dramatic over the fainting comment. We have worked past this issue now and on good terms again!\n\nMy(29M) and my wife (29F) both value our independence. We make around the same money. We keep our finances separate and we each pay half of the rent.We are currently traveling together in a walkable city and we are living in a hotel. We don\u2019t qualify for the free breakfast. So we basically have to buy food from nearby restaurants because the hotel's restaurants are super expensive. I have to admit that money is tight, we can only travel on a careful budget.\n\nThis morning I got up early and went and got a nice but small breakfast burrito for myself. My wife woke up and claimed she\u2019s hungry and wanted to walk to a nearby place to get some food for herself. (Even when we are at home, we almost never eat breakfast together) The problem is that she demanded I give her a chunk of my breakfast burrito so she could walk outside and get some food for herself. I told her that I had paid for my breakfast and it\u2019s already fairly small so I can\u2019t let her have some, otherwise it wouldn't be enough for me. She said she needed to eat something in the morning so she doesn\u2019t \u201cfaint\u201d during the walk to get her own food, which I completely don\u2019t understand since she only needs to walk a few blocks to find food. I told her I\u2019ll give her a chunk of my burrito if she is going to let me have a chunk of her food once she gets it. She called me petty and just walked out. And she had been giving me a passive-aggressive attitude since then.So Reddit, AITA?",

            "selftext": "My husband (27m) and I (26f) were married eight months ago. We had a BIG wedding with lots of food and drinks and people. I knew we would likely have leftovers, so had arranged for them to be donated to the soup kitchen we sometimes work with, however, my mom went behind my back and took most of it with her. I didn't really know what happened to the food.\n\nUntil now.\n\nMy sister Callie (30f) got married over the long weekend.  She didn't want to mess with any of the planning and- knowing how my mom was during my wedding- decided to let our mom take over the whole thing.\n\nAll we had to do was show up where we were told and party.\n\nThe ceremony was beautiful, but it was when the buffet was revealed that I noticed something odd.\n\nThe food looked eerily familiar. Like, identical to what I had for my wedding except for a little more dried out and sad.\n\nI found an opening and went to ask my mom about it where she happily told me she \"saved a fortune\" by unfreezing the food from my wedding to serve to the guests now. I was horrified and immediately voiced my concerns about safety. She got upset and said I was acting like a snob and should be happy the food wasn't going to waste. I argued that it was never going to be wasted, but she wouldn't hear it.\n\nI didn't want to make a scene, but was worried about people getting sick so snuck off to see my sister. She was horribly embarrassed- mentioned that mom said something about saving money but didn't question it because she didn't want to foot the bill like I had. She told me not to eat the food and thanked me for the warning.\n\nFrom there, my husband and I discretely started telling some guests to be weary of the food and the rest of the night was fine.\n\nMy mom caught some flack for being cheap, but I've also been catching heat. Some of our relatives have been saying that I intentionally made my family look bad and that the food was fine as it was frozen and then defrosted for the wedding. They say no one would have known if I didn't make a stink over it. I don't know if I did anything wrong, I could use some help and would like to know if I should apologize. AITA?\n\nEDIT: I'm getting a lot of repeat questions, so I figured I'd post here:\n\n1. My wedding had about 200 guests. My husband has a large family and we intentionally planned for more people to come and knew that a lot wouldn't for one reason or another so knew we'd likely have leftovers and wanted to be smart about it. \n2. My sister and her husband have been together for about 10 years. They recently decided to get married for tax reasons and wanted to do a courthouse wedding, but my mom BEGGED her to let her do an \"event\". So, she had a small wedding with only 50 people. My sister HATES planning and people, so she let my mom do everything\n3. Have ya'll ever heard of garage freezers? They're super common where I'm from.",

He asked me to make our contribution to the potluck and to please make something from my country. \n\nNo problem. I like cooking and I asked my mom to help. We had fun. My sister also pitched in. I made lots so that there was food for us for tonight and food for the potluck tomorrow. We made two batches. One was about as spicy as buffalo wings, the other was much hotter. \n\nMy husband came home and we all sat down to eat. My husband can keep up with my dad when it comes to spicy food. It's hilarious watching a Swede from Minnesota sweating in the middle of winter just from a little spice. \n\nMy dad wanted seconds and he went to get some but he served himself from the less spicy crock pot. \n\nHe asked me why I made white people food for dinner. My husband understood the question and asked about it. I answered honestly that I have had bad experiences with people eating food that I took to share. So I always made two versions. One is fully as authentic as I can make it.  The other version is white people food. It is tasty and exotic but definitely a trade off. For example I will use chicken instead of goat for the protein. And I will use 1/4 - 1/6 the amount of spice. \n\nMy sister laughed and said I was being racist by assuming they wouldn't be able to handle my cooking. I said that she had never taken ethnic food to trade in school or at work. She grew up here and has never considered herself anything but American. \n\nI think I'm being considerate and not racist making two versions.",

            "selftext": "**I am not the Original Poster. Original post by** u/veggieevengeance **in** r/entitledparents\n\n*Reminder - Do not comment on linked posts*\n\nmood spoilers: >!tension, confrontation, stress!<\n\n---\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[**I put vegetables in all my food so my roommate's kid won't eat them. The mom is UPSET**](https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/14nhvmf/i_put_vegetables_in_all_my_food_so_my_roommates/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) - Sat, July 01, 2023\n\nI(26f) live in a rented house with a single mother(30f) and her son(6m). I had another person living with me but they moved out and the mother moved in. I don't mind living with her and her kid. It's fine and we kind of do our own thing. I spend a lot of time at my boyfriend's place or working. Our work schedules collide so we really don't interact much but when we do it's fine. No issue there.\n\nI want to start with saying that she clearly struggles financially but I don't think it's an excuse. I don't make lots of money either.\n\nHowever I've noticed that my food would go missing or portions would be taken from it. I assumed it was her kid so I asked her if she'd stop him from eating my food. I was calm about it and she just said she would. It didn't really upset me when it first started. It started getting annoying when I'd get home from work and expect to have a meal's worth of leftovers in the fridge only to see it picked through or just gone. I kept bringing it up and she started getting annoyed with me bringing it up.\n\nJust from observing them I realized that neither of them ever eat vegetables. And judging by the food that would get picked through and the food that would be untouched. Anything with green in it was avoided. Orange chicken would be gone but chicken and broccoli would be untouched. So I started putting vegetables in EVERYTHING. I find vegetables to be delicious. And anything green or not a potato does not get eaten. So I could mix some bell peppers into the food and it would be fine. I make a big portion of vegetables pretty frequently anyway so I just started putting it in everything I eat. If I had leftover mashed potatoes i'd pour green beans in and mix it up. If I had leftover cheesy/bacon fries I'd pour broccoli all over it and mix it in.\n\nUsually my homemade stuff has vegetables in it but I started making sure everything did. I made a pot of mac n cheese(the kid's favorite thing) and poured in roasted brussel sprouts. Which is actually delicious to me and I'm eating more vegetables so it's a win win. She had been seeming annoyed but we were all home when I made the pot of mac n cheese. She was in the living room and saw me get out the brussel sprouts and was like \"what are you going to do with that?\" and I poured them in. She said I was being greedy and annoying. I just said \"I like brussel sprouts\" and that was it. She said \"we need food\" and I told her to go get some. Or stop buying only prepackaged things and your money will go further.\n\nI think she sees this as some big act of revenge but I just simply want to be able to eat my food.\n\nAlso want to add that the sharing is not the issue. It's expecting to have food there and it's not. So often I'd be working a long day and get home expecting to have a meal's worth of food and it all be gone. Or I wake up in a rush and had my food ready to eat in the morning only to find it gone. So now I have to skip breakfast. If she would simply text sometimes \"hey is it okay if we eat *food item*\" I would know and know to make other plans. I would stop for food or know I have to whip something up when I get home. Also I think eating the LAST of someone else's food is crazy and rude. If someone makes a big pot of something and you ask for a serving, sure. But if someone made something and there is one serving left and you eat it without permission that is evil as hell.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[UPDATE](https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/150kobh/i_put_vegetables_in_all_my_food_to_stop_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) in** r/pettyrevenge - Sat, July 15, 2023\n\nSo I have been steadfast with putting vegetables in everything. I've put vegetables in things I've never even thought of. This has carried on and the mom calls me a jerk but will not verbalize that she is eating my food. She just sees me making a lasagna and adding celery and bellpeppers in the layers of fumes off to the side. The only thing I can't add vegetables to is snacks like chips or if I bake brownies or cookies. However this is easily remedied by putting baked goods in a tupperware and keeping them in my room. Same with chips. As I have previously stated the sharing is not the issue. Recently the kid knocked on my door and asked if he would have a bag of microwave popcorn. I said yes and gave him one. All of this would be way less annoying if she'd just text \"hey can I have some of this\" and waited for my response before just helping herself.\n\nI do feel for the mom because she clearly struggles with cooking and trying new foods. She is older than me and winces at the thought of biting into anything green. And it is spreading to her kid but it's no excuse. A few days ago I was making taco meat out of ground beef and like usual she was looking without looking. She was off to the side watching my every move but trying her to look normal. I made a dish the day before that involved saut\u00e9ed mushrooms and cut up peppers. So when the meat was almost ready I opened the fridge and she freaked when she saw me holding the mushrooms. She said \"(son's name) hates mushrooms!\" and I just poured them in the pan and mixed along with the cut up peppers.\n\nThis caused her to react in a way I'd never seen from her before. She was yelling and stomping around the kitchen while the kid just watched. Felt bad for the kid to have to see his mom like that. People were worried about her tampering with my food. I don't think she's the kind to do that but if she did I would report that right away. She was flipping out but she didn't snatch my food or knock anything over. She was opening and slamming cabinets and it was all very silly.\n\nThen she started going off about how she is going to get the authorities involved. I just told her \"sure\" and that she needs to relax. She seemed genuinely upset and stressed and I told her that I understand being a single mom is hard but she needs to use her government assistance more responsibly. She'll come home with cold mac n cheese, sushi, and chicken from the grocery store prepared foods and blow all if it on that. I suggested food pantries and buying ingredients that last a while like potatoes. She said I was being condescending and I always have food to eat.\n\nThis is to address the \"just make a portion of your food and set it aside for her and the kid.\" I do NOT make enough money to regularly feed two other people. If every now and then she asked for some of my leftovers, sure. But this is a consistent thing that was happening. It's not simple as giving her leftovers that I \"won't eat anyway.\" If I make a pot of something I expect live off of that for the next few days. If it is eaten then MY money is messed up and I have to go shopping again and budget for more food. Wastes my time and money\n\n&nbsp;  \n\n**Reminder - I am not the Original Poster!**",

            "selftext": "I (24m) am visiting my Mom (54) for a couple of days. Yesterday evening I was in the kitchen preparing a chicken dish.\n\nMy mom's Boyfriend (55) came into the kitchen to prepare a salad and asked me if he could use the cutting board. The cutting board and knife were still soaked with chicken juice and had tiny bits of raw chicken on it, so I obviously said no, that he should use the spare one. I was still busy with cooking, but had planned to clean both by hand and then put it in the dishwasher. \n\nI am very cautious about food safety (especially regarding chicken) and I would not have let him used the board, even if he cleaned it by hand. Since I don't trust meat contaminated tools, if they weren't in the dishwasher.\n\nMy mom's Boyfriend on the other hand does not believe in food poisoning. He never had it, so obviously it can't exist. I don't know why he is so unreasonable regarding this topic, since he is not like that with other stuff. He is not anti-Vax or anything, it's just food safety he doesn't believe in.  \n\nHe still insisted on using the cutting board and knife. I reminded him of salmonella, to which he just sighed :\" You and your salmonella...\". I replied that if he wants to use it then fine, if he cleans it, it may not be up to my cleaning standards, but I don't have to eat that salad. Well that man did not intend to clean the cutting board, he wanted to cut the vegetables, that he wanted to eat raw, on the dirty cutting board, with the dirty knife. I immediately told him, that he cannot do that and we had a heated discussion. \n\nThis was not the first time we had a fight about food safety and I have more than once refused to eat anything he had prepared. In the past I had grabbed the kitchen utensils out of his hand and ensured that he could not do stupid like that. But this time I was already exhausted from having such a stupid discussion. I was also caught off guard, because he never attempted something so unsafe before. So I thought fine, if he wants to give himself salmonella so badly, then I will not stop him. \nI just warned my Mom how he prepared said salad (she did not eat it) and let him eat his food hazard. \n\nYou can probably guess what happened next.  \nIt's the next day and as expected, he is laying sick in bed. \n\nMy Mom pulled me aside and told me, I should have stopped him from preparing the salad on the cutting board. That I knew what would happen and that it was cruel of me, to let him eat it. \nI responded, that she knew how he prepared it and could have stopped him from eating it. Her reasoning is that there was already an argument, because she refused to eat the salad herself and she did not want to cause another. \n\nI do feel bad that he is know sick, but I tried to talk him out of it and I don't think i should have to physically stop him from doing something stupid like that. On the other hand I do feel like an asshole for letting him go trough with it.\n\nSo am I the asshole?",

Ordered dinner around 8pm, says arrival is just before 9pm. We through on the new Spider Man while we wait to kill time.\n\nA few minutes after nine, and I ask my wife if the food ETA had updated as I didn\u2019t get a text that food had arrived yet (shared account, she was watching the order on her phone). She pulls up the map, and the dasher is a half hour+ drive South of us driving the opposite direction of both our home and the restaurant.\n\nAnother 30 minutes and the driver has been driving all over the area to the South, through a few different cities, and still hasn\u2019t got any closer to delivering our food. Wife messages the Dasher asking if they knew when they\u2019d be arriving. No answer for another 10 minutes. Wife sends another message \u201care you going to bring us our food?\u201d and suddenly the order is cancelled by the Dasher for some reason along the lines of an accident or car troubles. \n\nMy wife, much smarter than I, had a suspicion that we wouldn\u2019t be getting our food. She took a couple screenshots throughout the wait time of where the driver had been driving, the entire time still driving. I uploaded the photos to my support ticket and got the reorder processed with four minutes to spare before the restaurant closed and a $50 credit on top.\n\nNot too often I get angry, but this bs had me steamed. Third order in a row that had been completely off. The other two we were given the wrong orders. Names were written on the outside of the bags in big sharpie letters.\n\nTLDR: Dasher drove around with the food for my family for two hours before cancelling the order and stealing our food.\n\nEdit to add: Wow. Didn\u2019t think this experience would be this relatable! Can\u2019t believe the amount of comments sharing similar stories that you all have been through.

            "selftext": "I (27F) am not a professional chef, but I have taken a bunch of cooking classes and love making elaborate meals for friends and family. About two years ago my brother, Greg (25M) married Cheryl (34F). Cheryl has a daughter from a previous relationship (Becca, 9F) who has several health conditions, including celiac and a severe dairy allergy that requires her to carry an epi-pen. \n\nLast weekend I hosted a dinner at my house for my parents' wedding anniversary. I made a fancy five-course dinner and in addition to my parents, I invited four close family friends, Greg, Cheryl and Becca, and my sister, her boyfriend and their twins (both 8M). Because of Becca's food restrictions, I found a restaurant in town that specializes in gluten-free, dairy-free (as well as other allergen-free) food, and arranged for them to make a full meal for Becca that I could pick up in advance of the party. I have made a variety of speciality meals in the past (for example, keto meals when my friend was following that diet) and I like the challenge, but knowing how serious Becca's restrictions were, I didn't trust myself to make her meal. I have ADHD and get easily distracted, and if I even used the wrong spoon or didn't completely wash some flour off a bowl, it could make her incredibly sick. \n\nI thought the \"take out\" solution was fine, but when I served the food, I saw Cheryl looking at Becca's plate with a stony face. For her part, Becca started eating and seemed fine. Cheryl whispered to Greg, and Greg asked if he could talk to me in the kitchen. When we got there he said that it was \"unbelievable\" that I couldn't be bothered to make something for Becca, that they'd been bragging about what a great cook I am to her, and that he knew I'd made keto, vegan, and other complicated kinds of food in the past; now she would feel left out because she didn't get to eat what the rest of the family was eating. He said that it was obvious that I didn't care about making his stepdaughter feel like a part of the family, and that they were leaving. Greg, Cheryl and Becca then left, which put a damper on the rest of the party. \n\nI felt like I did my best at the time, but in hindsight, I wonder if I should have tried harder to make Becca feel included since she is a relatively new addition to our family. AITA?",

            "selftext": "I am a SAHM. I do all the cooking, cleaning, and anything kid related. We are a family of 5. I make sure dinner is served before my boyfriend comes home at 5pm. Because I know he is always starving from working hard and providing for our family. So when it comes to dinner I am always the last to eat. After serving everyone and making sure everyone has their juice and whatever else they may need. As a result, I\u2019m usually the last to sit and enjoy my meal. Well this day was no different. I made Chinese food: fried rice, orange chicken, walnut prawns and my all time favorite egg rolls. I served everyone. I took meds to settle my stomach and sat down to wait for it work. \n\nI made my boyfriends plate stacked with rice and pleanty of egg rolls. When he got his plate he immediately asked if there was enough for seconds. I explained to him that I hadn\u2019t eaten yet and that there may be some left over after I serve myself up a plate. There wasn\u2019t much left, there was a spoon full of rice left and extra egg rolls (I made extra because they are my fav) \n\nI sat down on the couch an conversed with my boyfriend about his day. I watched as he polished off his food. He got up to take his plate to the kitchen. Came back chewing. I didn\u2019t honk anything of it. He tends to eat the scraps off of our children\u2019s plate so I thought nothing of it. He got up a few more time still munching and came back with a beverage. \n\nAgain, I have not eaten because I\u2019m waiting for my meds to kick in. 20min has passed, and my stomach is ready for the food I just spent hours making. I go in the kitchen and all of my egg rolls are gone. I was immediately upset. I told him I hadn\u2019t eaten. Told him not to touch the food until after I ate. \n\nWhen I confronted him he said \u201ceat the ones off the kids plate\u201d like WTF! I cooked and served everyone and this is how I\u2019m treated. He then offered to make me more and I declined as these are not store brought ready made egg rolls these are from scratch rolled up and then fried egg rolls. So no he couldn\u2019t make me anymore. \n\nTo make a long story short. I didn\u2019t eat I was pissed I went to bed hungry. No apology nothing. Am I the asshole for still being angry 2days later? I\u2019ve also boycotted cooking & anything related to my SAHM duties.",

There is one issue that drives me nuts. \n\nWe use a joint account to buy food for us, usually shopping together a few times a month and then one of us picking up things here and there. I cook dinner almost every night and we don\u2019t eat a ton of junk, but occasionally I\u2019ll buy things we both love for a weekend or to just indulge here and there. The issue is that I go to bed on the early side and he stays up late- and goes full ham on any junk food we have around on any given night of the week. I\u2019m talking an entire family size bag of chips and the entire container of queso- gone in one sitting that I was saving for Friday margaritas. I went to make us root beer floats with the quart of ice cream and 2liter of soda and they were gone from shopping 2 days prior. He doesn\u2019t ever replace things, he just gives me a sheepish smile when I ask where the rest of something is knowing that he ate it all.  \n\nSo last night after cleaning up the kitchen from dinner, I put all the candy and chips and anything shelf stable, in a different place where he wouldn\u2019t find them. He went ballistic after I went to bed that all the \u201cgood\u201d food was gone (even though I had just cooked a nice dinner). I told him \u201cwelcome to my world\u201d as this is constantly happening when I go to have anything that\u2019s been purchased! He said I was treating him like a child and I said he was acting like one. I don\u2019t care that he indulges but to literally finish off every bit of something that\u2019s been bought for us both to enjoy is getting really old. It\u2019s not a weight thing or a money thing- I just want him to leave maybe one portion for me or maybe we can enjoy together! So until he can show some will power, I told him I won\u2019t be keeping any junk food around for him to gorge on unless it\u2019s something he\u2019s purchased from his own account. \n\nPart of me thinks this is just funny, which is why I might be the AH- but I just think he needs to figure out how to share, figure out how not to consume the entire lot in one sitting, or figure out how to buy his own treats.",

We decided to have the first BBQ of the nice summer weather in our area at her place (we don\u2019t live together currently). She decided to make steaks and baked potatoes, and I made some side salads and I also was responsible for the drinks and chips. As my girlfriend got cooking, it just panned out that she ended up plating and serving to people as her steaks finished resting. When I went over to watch her plating, I noticed she had put butter and herbs and stuff all over the steaks. My family doesn\u2019t do this and I\u2019ve never seen it done this way so I asked her (politely) if she would put mine aside and I would do my fixings (I just want my steak with ketchup, I\u2019m pretty plain). Both she, her sister, and her Dad gave me very pointed looks. \n\nLater that evening she said she felt that it was rude to the \u201cchef\u201d (her in this instance) to ask for my food separately and that she wished I would have just trusted her to make me a nice plate of food, and that I shouldn\u2019t do that when I\u2019m a guest anywhere. I fairly commonly politely ask for my food to be made differently/more plain when I\u2019m a guest somewhere or at a restaurant because I generally prefer plain food. I didn\u2019t think this was rude. \n\nAITA for asking for my own food to be served differently outside my own home?",

Additionally, I thought it was ridiculous of her to criticize my son, a 7 year old, for making relatively innocuous and curious comments about food that is not familiar to him. He\u2019s at a curious age and is discovering the world, and I refuse to try and limit him and shut him down for not having the emotional sensitivity of an adult.\n\nPolitely, I told that mother that I was sorry her daughter was struggling with insecurities, and I found some online parenting articles about building your child\u2019s confidence to send to her so she could use some tips to help her daughter out.\n\nShe replied and said I was acting completely shamelessly and disgracefully, and I am not able to text her anymore.

But I cook them with no seasoning, and put them in a container with unseasoned, cooked. Basmati rice. Then when I get ready to eat, I\u2019ll add some soy sauce.  Or maybe this day I feel like taco sauce, or Worcestershire, or dry rub seasoning, etc. By doing it this way, you don\u2019t have to eat 10 chicken breasts seasoned the same exact way.

            "selftext": "My partner and I live a very frugal lifestyle in a relatively HCOL area, especially when it comes to food. I make almost everything we eat from scratch using clearance and bulk ingredients, including bread, condiments, etc. We're big fans of cold cut sandwiches for lunch, and we've been buying bone-in turkey breasts, holiday hams (after the holidays) and whole roaster chickens on sale for years, freezing them until needed and prepping our own cold cuts for lunches each week. Obviously inflation has hit everyone hard, us included, but making everything from scratch has shielded us somewhat... but it's been a long, difficult week, we were out of homemade cold cuts and I decided to buy some from the deli counter at a grocery store near us last night.\n\nI stupidly didn't check the per lb. cost, assuming it would be like, $3-4/lb like it was a few years ago\u2013 kind of expensive, but manageable. I got to the checkout and 2 lbs of normal, roast chicken deli meat from a normal grocery store cost TWENTY FOUR DOLLARS. It was almost $12/lb. That's like the cost of 4+ entire homemade meals for us.\n\nBack to the old way, I guess... can't even cut a corner on something simple anymore. It's genuinely terrifying to know that buying too much DELI CHICKEN could be financially ruinous at this point. Where does it end?-\n\nEdit: Some additional thoughts.\n\nI am clearly not alone in this! This was just meant to be a \"vent\" post but clearly it's resonated. Thanks for all the helpful and supportive responses\u2013 I really hope that collectively, we can organize and DO something about the price gouging/\"inflation\" happening at the supplier and retailer level. A start is contacting your state and local governments and mentioning your concerns with rising food costs and food scarcity\u2013 look up retailers or manufacturers headquartered in your area and mention those retailers by name when contacting elected officials. And, if price gouging continues and worsens, we need to be collectively ready to organize and protest.\n\nThis post is getting way more attention than I expected, and I'm getting some kind of awful comments/messages. I don't know how to caveat this any more than I did in my original post, but I know prices are high for a lot more than just deli meat, and I know deli meat is a convenience food (i.e., higher price point in general), which is why I don't normally buy it. That being said, I don't think it's an extravagant luxury, and no one should feel shamed for buying something that makes their lives easier on occasion\u2013 you can be frugal with your time and sanity sometimes, too. I feel extremely lucky that a) I have the time and equipment needed to cook frugally from scratch and b) I'm only cooking for my partner and I in a dual-income household. Everyone commenting \"stop buying deli meat then\" \u2013 well, that's obviously my plan, but that's not really helpful commentary, it's not just deli meat, and families who rely on convenience foods shouldn't have to starve.\n\nFinal edit: The area we're located grew QUICKLY during and post-Covid when it was named \"one of the best places to live and work remote.\" Housing and food costs have risen dramatically, not to mention scarcity\u2013\u00a0my city made a number of \"largest COL increase\" lists the past couple of years (went from moderate to high, along with lots of other compounding factors) and my partner and I are indeed looking to move. Simply packing up and moving hours away is not attainable for everyone!",

Kate has read a lot of alternative medicine blogs and genuinely believes a bunch of myths like food combining and gut biome related. At first, we tried to accomodate her concerns as it was coming from a place of love for the kids but the list has grown to a point my husband and I are no longer able to follow them all and have given up.\n\nSome food rules include:\n\n* No fruit after 5pm\n* No liquids directly before a meal or while eating or shortly after eating\n* No ice cold drinks, only cool or lukewarm\n* No non-natural sugars\n* No FODMAP foods\n* No combining starches/carbs\n* 15 minutes of digestion sitting time after every meal\n* No gluten at all\n\nThere are way more rules than this, we have a google document that she updates with new rules and hyperlinks to \"studies\" that show why its important that the stepkids follow these rules. \n\nThe reason why I wonder if we're being an asshole for not following these rules is the history between Kate and my husband. \n\nMy husband's third child with Kate passed away at a very young age due to complications from an allergy. They had left the three kids with Kate's niece as a babysitter, and their youngest son had an allergic reaction. No one knew that 3M was allergic to anything, and the cousin mistakenly thought an allergic reaction was just being ill and gave him benadryl to help him sleep it off. It was what lead to their marriage breakdown, and Kate has been very fearful about what the other two kids eat ever since.\n\nMy MIL is firmly on Kate's side and has been berating my husband and myself for not following Kate's rules regarding food. But my children/my husbands stepkids (10M, 15F) don't follow these rules obviously, and its making all meals impossible to handle. 10F, 13M hate following these rules when my children don't, and my husband and I don't think its fair for my children to have to eat this restrictive diet. \n\nAITA for not following Kate's food rules for her kids when they're at our place?",

            "selftext": "I (21f) usually always sit with the same group of people in my university\u2019s dining area. \nThere\u2019s this girl who i\u2019ve talked to a few times, but i\u2019m not really friends with. She\u2019s kind of quiet, but when she finally talks she seems normal. \nI\u2019ve sat across from her a few times and noticed how she was eating because it was weird to me. She eats maybe half of her food (keep in mind you control the amount of food. it\u2019s cooked by the cafeteria staff buffet-style. \nshe could easily take less) and kind of plays with it with her fork when she\u2019s \u201cdone\u201d (aka eating half of it, sometimes even less). \n\nI didn\u2019t say anything for a while, but a few weeks ago I had to ask her why she always only ate half her food. She seemed a  embarrassed, but answered she thought she was more hungry and laughed it off. I then asked her why she made this mistake every time we ate, and that she must have learned by now. \nShe didn\u2019t really answer (I don\u2019t actually remember, but it wasn\u2019t actually an explanation) and left pretty quickly. \nShe doesn\u2019t really show up that much anymore, but when she does she still eats like this, and I couldn\u2019t hold it in anymore. I asked her once again, and also asked her if her parents never told her not to play with her food. \n\nIt was a genuine question, some people are raised in households where manners aren\u2019t important, but obviously they are for most people. She got really mad at me and told me to stop commenting on her eating habits and that it was none of my business. I told her that it absolutely was since she was sitting at our table and obviously wasting food. She told me to go fuck myself and left and threw out the rest of her food (AGAIN!) \nAfter she left, one of my friends told me to leave her alone as she seemed like she was having a hard time and maybe had some sort of issue with food. \nYeah, obviously she has an issue with food?? She keeps wasting it! She hasn\u2019t shown up again, i\u2019m assuming she buys her own food now, which might teach her not to waste it so that\u2019s good. The same friend who told me to leave her alone keeps pestering me to apologise to her, but I think she should apologise to me. She\u2019s unnecessarily rude when being asked the most basic and obvious questions and also told me to go fuck myself? That\u2019s way more harsh than anything i\u2019ve ever told her. \nKeep in mind that I care a lot about food waste and the environment.\nAITA for telling a girl to stop wasting food?\n\n\nEDIT: OK! I\u2019m the asshole! Sorry i\u2019m not studying to be an eating disorder specialist. I looked up stuff about it and i\u2019m realising I was too harsh. I\u2019ll apologise the next time I see her and try not to be so condescending. But you should all follow your own advice. If people genuinely don\u2019t know something you should tell them nicely instead, and i realise i should\u2019ve tried to educate her NICELY about food waste and not have commented at all on how she was eating",

            "selftext": "**I am NOT OP. Original post by u/real-chinese-food in r/AmItheAsshole**\n\ntrigger warnings: >!Domestic abuse, racism, suicidal thoughts!<\n\nmood spoilers: >!OOP ends an abusive relationship!<\n\n---\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[**AITA for cooking my BF's family Chinese food instead of \"Chinese food\"**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zxolf2/aita_for_cooking_my_bfs_family_chinese_food/?sort=top) - december 28, 2022\n\nI was born in China, but my parents and I moved to the West when I was little, so I was raised mostly \"westerner\" but my parents still managed to teach me many Chinese traditions, including food, and I sometimes still cook what they cook.\n\nSo, I have been with my boyfriend for about 3 years and he lives with me at my place. This Christmas, his family (Mom, dad, sister and nephew) came to visit him from his birth country (Spain) for the first time in years. I was excited because I never had a chance to meet them in person.\n\nThey arrived a few days before Christmas, he went to pick them up at the airport while I was working, so when I came home they were already there. The meeting didn't go as well as I would wish, because the little nephew as soon as he saw me started doing the eye stretching thing. He was immediately reprimanded by his mom and grandparents, but the following days he made a lot of racist jokes in Spanish like \"What do you call someone who doesn't take a shower, in Chinese? Shin-Shan-PU (without shampoo)\" and he was barely reprimanded for that.\n\nBesides that, Christmas went great, and the next day we woke up very late. The nephew started saying that he wanted Chinese Food for lunch, so my BF's parents asked me if I could make it, I said sure, I was glad to do it. I cooked something my parents would do in a special occasion like these, and served the table in a very traditional way, with chopsticks and everything. Then I called everybody to the table, and instantly saw their disappointed faces.\n\nThe nephew said \"What's this?\" to which I said \"Chinese food\" he grunted and said \"No is not\" and started to throw a fit. His mom calmed him down, then BF's parents told me \"This isn't what we were expecting\" I asked \"What did you expect?\" and they replied \"You know, something like what they serve at restaurants\". I tried to explain to them that this is something actual Chinese people eat, but wouldn't listen. They dressed up and went outside to eat at a restaurant.\n\nMy BF stayed at home, but then called me stupid, he said \"You knew exactly what they meant by Chinese food, I'm trying to make YOU look good in front of them, but you're not helping me by playing dumb\". I asked him to explain himself better but just shouted \"When people say Chinese food the last thing they expect is white rise, get a f*ing clue\" and locked himself in our bedroom.\n\nSince that incident, they started to speak to me as a toddler, over explaining everything they asked me to do, and stopped correcting the nephew's racist behavior. I tried to tell my BF to tell them to stop, but he said \"This is you're making, now they think you're brainless\" This continued till they left yesterday.\n\nMy BF and I now barely talk, and I wonder if it's really my fault and I should have known better.\n\nThere are some comments made by OOP deleted by the mods. It seems like she was trying to defend her BF when people called him a racist, based on the responses to those deleted comments.\n\n**Some relevant comments:**\n\nOk_Job_9417: \nNTA - they\u2019re from Spain, if you asked them for food from their country and rhen aftwrwards was like no, I wanted the type of stuff you\u2019d get from Taco Bell. They\u2019d lose their shit. (Yes, I\u2019m aware Taco Bell isn\u2019t Spain food. But people do understand that racists lump everyone together right? They would assume OP\u2019s family is Mexican because they ignore every other Spanish speaking country. They also interchange Spanish and Mexican).\n\nThey\u2019re racist and so is your boyfriend. I\u2019d cut the cord and find someone who can appreciate your culture.\n\nETA: he might not be the full blown cartoon villian racist but he does have some racism in him. His nephew was making racist behavior and he didn\u2019t correct him. He belittled you for not making the \u201cright\u201d kind of Chinese food. Flipping out about serving white rice when it seems pretty standard to have white rice come with Chinese food takeout.\n\nIt feels like he\u2019s gaslighting you by trying to make this your fault for their racist behavior. He might not have shown you that side before, but he did now.\n\nrabidturbofox:\nPrioritizing the needs and comfort of racists is in itself racist, and OP should remind herself of this.\n\nIt\u2019s when things get tough that people show you who they really are, and what her boyfriend showed her is that when things get tough, he sides with racists and gets verbally abusive. That\u2019s who he is.\n\nDefiant-Turn2471:\nDoes your boyfriend help pay the rent and bills? Does he insult you a lot? Does he often criticize how you do things? Do you ever feel like you need to always cater to what he wants to have peace in the household?\n\nWho makes the decisions in your household? Do you both discuss things then decide on what to do or is he the only one making decisions and you are expected to just follow?\n\nDid you tell him you did not like the way you were treated by his family and the way he acted? If he still does not realize how wrong he and his relatives were then that should show you what kind of person he is.\n\nOOP replies:\nId read this and had to go to the bathroom to cry a little. My answer to every single one of those questions might be upsetting for you, I never thought about it and, im just speechless right now.\n\nButWhyThoughhhh quoted an edit on the original post and wrote:\nNTA\n\n\"Edit: Lots of you are calling my BF racist, but before this he didn't show any racism towards me, I know sometimes he is rude to some people, but he never before was this rude to me, the only thing I might think of is he motivating me to improve my Spanish while he never did an effort to learn Chinese for me, but I understand that Chinese is hard. Just want to make it clear that he is not a cartoon racist villain.\"\n\nHun, maybe he's not a cartoon racist but he's a hidden one. He's shown you his true colors now and has created a truly hostile situation while making no attempts to stand up for you. Listen to him, the behavior will only get worse\n\nnousernamehere12345:\nHow old was the nephew? I'm so sorry he behaved so terribly and that the rest of the family joined in. And your boyfriend? They're all racist and your boyfriend is, at the very least, unbelievably rude. Even though we've never met I know you deserve better.\n\nOOP says: He is 12.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[**Update about my boyfriend**](https://www.reddit.com/user/real-chinese-food/comments/11fmjs3/update_about_my_boyfriend/?sort=old) - March 01 2023.\n\n\nHi, it's me, I'm alive, Im sorry for disappearing for so long. A lot has happened in the last weeks. Sorry if I'm not very detailed, I'm very tired today.\n\nFor those who already know my story, my boyfriend allowed his family to be racist to me. After his family left, I tried to break up with him, but he wouldn't let me end the relationship, I tried talking to him but he would say something along the lines of \"I'm not breaking up with you\".\n\nI talked to my family about it, they were furious at him and I had their support, specially my father. I'm so glad that they were by my side.\n\nI went to my place with my father to confront my boyfriend and break up once and for all. He didn't take it will, shouted that I can't break up with him and he wont end the relationship, that's where my dad intervened and they started fighting, like... fist fighting. My dad ended up being hurt but he also landed some punches on my boyfriend, I was horrified, crying, screaming and with no idea of what to do. My BF then grabbed me, got my purse and took me out, my dad followed me. My keys and phone where in the purse so I couldn't go back in. He locked himself and we started hearing him breaking stuffs.\n\nThen dad called the police. They arrived like half an hour later, during that entire time he did hear him breaking stuffs. When the cops finally arrived tried to talk to him but wouldn't respond, so they broke the door and after another fight they arrested him.\n\nI walked in my place with another cop and my dad and everything was destroyed. Everything he could break was broken, from glasses to plates to mirrors to holes in the walls, every TV, my computer, my phone, coffee maker, etc. Dad pressed charges immediately.\n\nI was terrified, and I'm still terrified. We had a trial and he is in jail now, but I think he might be deported to spain, I'm not sure.\n\nI'm still in therapy and still living with my parents. Some of my stuffs were repaid but I'm still not ready to come back home. Sometimes I still wake up crying in the middle of the nigh. I dont know if I regret standing up for myself, or if I will be able to trust people in the future, I might die alone without a husband or children and that makes me sad. I had suicidal thoughts but I find things that make me want to stay alive.\n\nI dont know when will I feel good for real, but progress has been made.\n\nOh, and my ex-BF's family are still trying to reach me to insult me and make me feel even worst for sending him to jail. I block them but always find yet another phone number to call me from or a temporary mail address.\n\nIf you are reading this, thank you.\n\n**This is the last time OOP posted, Here are some relevant comments on the update**:\n\nbarleysully:\nI\u2019m so incredibly proud of you!! You are a domestic violence SURVIVOR. You and your father stood up to your disgusting abuser and finally got out of that awful relationship.\n\nThis was so important for your health and safety. You did everything right! I\u2019m so sorry you have had to endure so many terrible crimes. He never should have assaulted you, your father, or your personal items. He is a sorry excuse for a human being. Please be sure you hold nothing back when pressing charges, and ensuring you get back as much as possible and that he goes to jail for as long as possible.\n\nFinally, please take care of yourself now. Do things you love. Reach out to friends, pursue hobbies, go to a spa, take a vacation, binge your favorite tv shows. You must live your life to the fullest and never let someone like him in your life again. Be proud of yourself, you are so strong. \u2764\ufe0f\n\nkheinz_57:\nNo, OP, say it with me, \u201cI DID THE RIGHT THING STANDING UP FOR MYSELF!\u201d Your EX is a lunatic along with his psycho family and you are so much better off without them. Please don\u2019t let this prevent you from having a good life. I promise you there are people who will treat you with all the respect you deserve. You made the right choice. And in the future, you will look back and be so proud of yourself for leaving.\n\nWaste-Boot-1084:\nYou need to be proud of YOU!! As a victim of DV for my entire childhood, it doesn\u2019t matter when you leave, it just matters that you did. Stay in therapy and be honest with what you\u2019re feeling. I promise these emotions will get easier over time. Celebrate you!\n\nKiyoko_Mami272821:\nI\u2019m so proud of you! You are a strong woman! It takes a lot to leave and stay away! It\u2019s also very hard to start over but here you are and you have your whole life ahead of you! Never let anyone treat you any less than you deserve! \u2764\ufe0f\n\n**Reminder - I am not the original poster.**\n\nEdit: OOP did a post on r/relationships the day after her AITA post because it was removed, but it was kinda the same, this time asking for advice on how to make her boyfriend understand what his family said was not OK, but it was also removed by mods. I didn't include it here because was kinda redundant.",

It only happened in late evening, when all you could see were shadows, and nothing defined.  I tried following the sound, and all I ever managed to see was something dark, flitting around in the sky.\n\nSo for the longest time, I thought it was a bat.

Needless to say, the good professor gave me a look like I had an Elvis-impersonating singing mushroom growing out of my eyebrows.\n\nIndeed, it wasn't until I came across [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlfKE2D16Fc) that I finally learned the truth.\n\nHere's a more...*scientific* [video that has the sound of it's mating flight.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIGuAT-HOwI)",

Just because you _need_ it does not mean you _deserve_ it. It\u2019s how survival has always functioned. You earn everything you have. You go to work so you can afford your own food, you pay your taxes so you can have roads to go to work and a hospital if you ever need one (barring the extraordinary medical debt), and you go to sleep knowing you took care of yourself.\n\nIt\u2019s not my or anyone else\u2019s responsibility or obligation to make sacrifices to help others; however, that doesn\u2019t mean that we shouldn\u2019t. Humans are extraordinarily unique when compared to other animals. We have never our wounded or sickly to die, because we are hardwired to be social through compassion and empathy.\n\nI earnestly believe that nobody deserves anything, but I volunteer regularly and am generally the go-to problem solver for my friends. I will help out anyone I feel I can help without putting myself at risk. The people who argue this are trying to argue that they shouldn\u2019t be obligated to support other people, and I completely agree with them on that front.

You have no idea how they ended up the way that they are, or how they ended up needing what they do, but if you are able to help them, it\u2019d be terrible to just let them suffer. \n\nIt is not my obligation to help them, nor is it anyone else\u2019s, but if we\u2019re as high-minded and above other species as we\u2019d like to believe, why is that such a contentious idea for some people?

Look at the homeless problem in California, and more importantly, what they did about it. What they've done is have enough help that they've attracted a massive out of state homeless population, while handling everything inefficiently because shelters are being built locally in expensive cities, rather than building them all somewhere in the cheap part of the state where there's also farming jobs for them. \n\nThe net effect is that the homeless are optimized to annoy as many people as they can in the cities, while being a costly problem that seems to get worse when you throw money at it, as well as largely not even being from in state. And the result of this is a slowly growing backlash against them, to the point their tents get attacked late at night, and people rarely see who's doing it.",

            "selftext": "I deliver to a business in my town on the regular that has hundreds of employees. The delivery instructions for this was to leave the delivery inside the second set of doors in the building and to just take a picture and go about my business. \n\nI texted the employee to let them know I'll be dropping their food off in about 2 to 3 minutes and they responded with the thank you have a nice weekend.\n\nAs I was getting back to my car the security guard has the food in her hand and is screaming at me that I can't do that because there could be a bomb in the bag. I explained to her that it was labeled with a doordash receipt and furthermore if it was a bomb how foolish she would be for picking it up. \n\nShe then told me it was against company policy which I politely said to her you would have to take that up with your employee as I don't work for your company. She continues to keep screaming at me so I just get in my car back out and I'm about to drive away and she throws the customer's food at my windshield and it explodes all over the place.\n\nObviously I'm pretty pissed at this point and I exchanged a few words with her nothing threatening just letting her know how much of an ass she is being. Her Superior comes out and they call the police. \n\nFour police cars show up and they asked me for my ID which I didn't give to them because I didn't commit a crime. Which then afterwards the customer whose food has exploded all over my windshield and hood comes out and is screaming at the security guard. \n\nLong story short the police officers told me I wasn't breaking any laws and they can give me a trespassing warning for the building if the company decides to pursue that. Then again I told them they can't have my ID because a crime wasn't committed and since I'm not an employee of this building I obviously can't violate company employee policy. They let me go with no further questions. \n\nAnything happen to anyone else with security similar to this?\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit: I would also like to share the reasoning for not giving my ID to the police officers. Not only is it a violation in my state since we're not a stop and ID state of my fourth amendment rights, but furthermore I don't want to receive a trespassing violation from a building that on the minimum I make $25 to $40 of deliveries daily to. I'm not going to sacrifice my living because the security officer had a bad day and decided to throw food at my car that didn't belong to them.\n\n\nReturn trip: so I just dropped off another delivery to a customer that was waiting outside the building for me and guess who was waiting out there with a pen and paper taking my license plate down. Lol. If this happens again I'm actually going to go to the police station and press formal harassment charges against them. This is a very large brand. I was originally just going to chalk it up to somebody having a bad day which we all do, but now she's obviously made it personal and wants to hurt my livelihood, so now I guess I have no other choice than to submit a complaint with the town. I also have her on video writing down my license plate number outside of the building and I had zero interaction with her whatsoever.\n\n\nLast sidenote: I want to thank everyone who supported me here. I was expecting a half and half split here of most people thinking I was the douche as opposed to the guard. Appreciate the support, stay strong, be safe and know your rights. :)",

Theyre always in trouble with unhappy customers and have a reputation for being sketchy.\n\nI sued them and won 6 years ago because my bill was $370 and when I received the receipt the shopper only paid $140 because they used a ton of coupons and half the items in my order were incorrect because they chose to grab items that had coupon deals rather than the items I picked. For example I ordered $45 worth of powerade, it was 6 packs with 8 bottles in each pack, instead I received 10 singular bottles because they were on sale for 50 cents each. That isn't what I paid, nor whar I paid for yet its what I received and almost the entire order was like that. The shopper substituted items in that they could use coupons for to pay significantly less than I paid and then keep the remainder. \n\nWhen I contacted support they said they're terribly sorry and after speaking to multiple managers and supervisors the only thing they said they could do was offer me was $30 credit for my next order. I told them to go fuck themselves and immediately talked to a lawyer, sued them for basically running a scam on me, won the case, $27,450, it wasn't much but it was satisfying.",

That said, we are frugal about food, not cheap. We do not buy strawberries in winter, but certainly budget enough to get them when in season. I work hard to properly wash and store my produce, and have ways to use it up past its prime. Fruit and greens are frozen for smoothies, veggies are frozen for soup, potatoes and eggs help us use up weird leftover amounts. \n\nUsing \"soft\" produce like spinach right away and \"hard\" produce like broccoli later in the week reduces food waste, too.",

                "I have Celiac Disease, so I don't get to be frugal when it comes to food. I get sick from the slightest trace of gluten, so I can't eat most of the cheap processed food that other people on this sub rely on. I can't even eat most canned and frozen foods, even single ingredient stuff, because it's processed on shared equipment with stuff that contains gluten. And cheap spices sometimes have flour added to them as filler, so I buy expensive, high-quality, gluten-free-labeled spices online.\n\nI drive 20 minutes to Aldi and Costco (sometimes Target, which is a little closer) because they tend to have the best deals on the food I buy compared to other stores in my area. My diet mainly consists of fresh meat (which I buy in bulk and freeze) and fresh produce, which is relatively expensive. I do buy some processed foods, but I have to be very selective because they tend to be either unsafe for me or the gluten free versions are too expensive. I rarely go to gluten free bakeries or buy gluten free bread because it's so expensive. I do my own gluten free baking, but even then, the gluten free flours are much more expensive than wheat flour so I have to set some limits.\n\nSorry, but I don't want to eat rice and beans for every meal. Even if I did, I would only be able to buy certain brands of rice and beans, which aren't necessarily the cheapest, because again, these ingredients (especially beans) tend to be processed on shared equipment with gluten grains.\n\nI guess I do save some money by not going out to restaurants very often. There are only a couple of restaurants in my area that are safe for me. Fast food is pretty much off limits. So there's that at least.",

I currently have oats with coconut milk and golden milk spice. with Each batch is a about four days worth so I have some flexibility. My husband and I grab from these as we desire. I use mason jars and can reheat in a little almost like crock pot thing at work that\u2019s made for pint mason jars. After this I am pretty liberal about dinner. Often I keep it simple. Burgers, pasta, chicken, fish, tofu. I bake my own breads and such. Takes some doing. But I\u2019m not cooking all the time. I use the freezer a lot with pre loaded made food for nights I don\u2019t want to cook. \nOften people wonder how I can afford it and I just say because I hardly eat out and don\u2019t buy processed foods. I think Mac and cheese and frozen lasagnas are crazy expensive! I do eat out maybe once a week. Mostly tacos. Love tacos. I have compared and I\u2019m quite sure in the end I am coming out at least 1/3 to 1/2 of what other people spend on groceries. Helps I like oatmeal.

It really sucked and has led to some disordered eating habits for my two siblings and me. \n\nWe try to focus on cooking our meals at home instead of eating out during the week, but if we want filets for dinner that\u2019s what we\u2019re buying.

I'll shop at places like Trader Joes and Whole Foods for mid-level specialty snacks and cheeses, which are pricier than bare bottom grocery stores, but cheaper than like Erewhon. I'll also stock up when a fav pantry item is on sale, but if it's not and it's something that I prefer to the generic, I won't just buy the generic. Also, I don't mind spending money at restaurants a few nights a month if it's something I can't make easily at home, and I'm generous with tips (like 30%). We are a car-free household though, so the increased price for quality food is kind of like our gas expense if you think about it lol.\n\nI grew up poor though so there are some real cheap foods that just scratches that itch - sometimes I just need some hot dogs and kraft mac n cheese, iykyk.",

Also it makes it easier to do calorie counting because it's already been taken care of with the nutrition facts.\n\n(In both of these cases however I usually wait until these things are on sale before I make meals around them, so even when I'm not frugal, I'm being frugal about it!)",

After I completed undergrad and graduate school (I took out student loans to cover what I could not personally afford) I had a period of personal instability that lasted for several years.  I went to the local center and applied for EBT/SNAP and the kind  assistance of the worker enabled me to receive $192 per month in food benefits which I used at local markets.  Yes, the card issued was distinctive and could be seen from a distance and yes, IMHO the program should issue inconspicuous cards that blend in so others in line cannot see how you are paying. However, I used the caloric intake to get back to working and after 18 months receiving food stamps resumed a career path and now pay approximately .. well, a major percentage of my income in taxes.  Those 18 months of food security at the taxpayers expense will reap dividends for society far in excess of their present value at the time they were issued to me, particularly in the way of psychological boost and also because the supermarkets removed all of the money as a \"subsidy\" (I didn't use my ebt card for hot food or booze or smokes even though some local spots let you swipe for those).  There are some ancient religions which warn folks that one should NOT delay in asking for help, I feel more loyal to the society and more secure knowing there was help for me when I needed it without much stigma or judgment by most.

This has caused massive amounts of rich people's wealth to go to Jeff Bezos, China, etc. So,  the US wealth trends downward while a smaller and smaller number of super-rich people, and cheap manufacturing countries get wealthier.\n\nSo now the rich cling tighter to what they have, because it's losing value. They want more, so they pay to defund programs benefitting the poor. And how do they prove those programs should be cut? Disuse. A social stigma is attached to food stamps making people think they should feel guilty for using them - so they don't. If hardly anyone uses a program, then that program is removed.\n\nSo use every damn penny the government let's you have. Because someone on top is using everything they can to (1) make you even more poor, (2) take money from your pocket and put it into thiers, and (3) make you feel bad for actually taking LESS tax money for yourself than THEY take. All of it, every cent - you get it, and you spend it - the government is FOR the people. If you keep spending, and you still even think that you're a LITTLE poor, hell, apply for more! No one should have to live below the standards of the \"middle\" class, this money is just to lift you up to the same level. You take nothing from the middle class, you only take it from seething billionaires that would let you die without a second thought.",

There would be a lot of children struggling with school due to hunger or lack of adequately nutritious food, and that would also lead to developmental issues down the road, both physical and mental. Same goes for adults trying to make it through the workday. There would be more and more elderly people forced to choose between paying for food or paying for bills and or medications. \n\nFood insecurity is also terrible for people's mental health and morale.

                "Absolutely not. There\u2019s four major reasons:\n\n**Insurance**\n\nIf you buy car insurance and get into an accident, it\u2019s not immoral to get paid money to repair the car. That\u2019s the whole point. You could say that you\u2019re getting paid for crashing your car, but then you\u2019re not looking at the bigger picture. Similarly, if you don\u2019t crash your car, you have to pay into the insurance pool without getting anything in return.\n\nSimilarly, everyone in society agrees to pay for social insurance. If you end up broke, you get a payout in the form of Medicaid and SNAP. If you don\u2019t, you have to pay taxes for something you don\u2019t use, but is available in case you end up needing it.\n\n**Incentives** \n\nPart of the money also forms a social safety net. People are able to take on more risks like starting a business because worst case scenario, you\u2019ll be poor if you fail. But you won\u2019t starve. This creates an extra benefit for society overall, not just the individuals involved. Think of it as a 1+1=3 kind of thing. More risk equals more reward. \n\n**Payment**\n\nPart of the money is payment to avoid something that bothers people. People don\u2019t like seeing starving kids. So people pay extra money just to avoid that unpleasant sight. You get paid to hangout in a homeless shelter instead of on the street. There\u2019s a Family Guy joke similar to this:\n\n> Lois: Where the hell is my white wine with Sprite in it?! \n\n> Waiter: Hi again. That man over there reading a book by himself has offered to pay for your meal if you move to a table outside. \n\n> Quagmire: You're not the d\u0456ck in this situation. You're paying for their meal, so you can't be the d\u0456ck.\n\n**Investment**\n\nEven if you\u2019re down on your luck, you\u2019re still a fully functioning human who will probably be able to help others tomorrow. If your car breaks, you pay to repair it. You don\u2019t destroy it because you\u2019d be losing all the residual value in the car. Similarly, society invests in you. Public education is a classic investment that results in much more overall wealth for society. Taking a poor kid and teaching them things makes them much more able to contribute to others. If someone is sick and can\u2019t work, fixing that problem today enables them to do stuff tomorrow.\n\nAlso, it doesn\u2019t have to be you specifically. Maybe it\u2019s your kid. Maybe it\u2019s someone you indirectly mentor. Or maybe it\u2019s just some random person, and not you. Venture capital firms invest in 100 companies hoping one will pay out and make enough money to cover the 99 failures. But there\u2019s no way to predict the future. You can try to figure things out in advance, but the winning company is almost always a surprise. Similarly, society invests in education for millions of kids hoping that even if most of them squander it, one will come up with a new idea so revolutionary, it will transform the world. There\u2019s maybe a 1 in a billion chance, so we can\u2019t risk not educating everyone. Human brains are a limited resource. So say there\u2019s 100 million Americans on Medicaid. Even if 80 million never generate enough money to pay society back, the other 20 million will make more than enough to justify caring for everyone, especially given that we can\u2019t predict who it will be in advance.\n\nAll of this gets into investing concepts like risk, reward, time, diversification, insurance, hedges, compound interest, lotteries, gambling, etc. It\u2019s much bigger than any individual person or circumstance.

Everyone I know on Medicaid is working. Most of us two jobs with no health insurance offered, or insurance that costs more per month through the employer than rent does.\n\nI'll tell you something the cashier is probably on Medicaid too, maybe even food stamps themselves. Cashiering doesn't pay that much. I worked in a grocery as a pandemic job when layed off. I got $11/hour to stock, and they routinely had only one cashier scheduled ($13/hr) so they woudl pull people from other departments to go up and cashier. You wouldn't get paid the difference (for the majority of the shift that you spent cashiering). The health insurance was $550 a month, roughly $133 each weekly paycheck. If you weren't scheduled enough hours to make $133 for the health insurance, it got taken out anyway, and you had a negative paycheck until you got scheduled enough hours to make some money. The deductible (out of pocket before insurance kicks in) was $1,500.  \n\nBelieve me the cashier is not going to judge you for being on ebt/food stamps. They will judge you for not knowing what your balance is on it, or if you have been a regular and still don't know what the ebt covers and what it doesn't after some time. Or if you cause a back up on their register (becuase they get in trouble for not going fast enough).\n\nMost people are kidding themselves that they can afford the health insurance from their employer. It's a crisis that's been unfolding for awhile, and people in healthcare and the government know it, despite their snide dismissal of medicare and medicaid for all.  Two person incomes where one person's income is for paying the bills and the other's income goes completely to health insurance from their employer have been the norm for awhile.

Whether the cashier or the other people in line or the Republicans in congress believe it or not, you deserve to eat.",

                " Is it morally wrong to use food stamps? : No.\n\nWhat is the role of government? Besides protecting the territorial integrity, it's taking care of it's citizens. Not letting your citizens starve to death if you are the wealthiest country in history seems like a no-brainer.  \n\n\nAnd it is funny how the middle class never complains about all the leeching and mooching they do. All their tax breaks, child benefits, mortgage tax credits, earned income tax credit, the list goes on and on. The middle class receives far more benefits than the poor do, I am pretty sure.   \n\n\nAnd if they really are against it, they can vote it out of existence. But talk about something being morally wrong, I think that would be far higher up the list than utilizing a program you qualify for so you don't starve to death.",

Quit your job. Easy. Would you rather receive a small amount of government assistance than be able to buy food with your own job income? Then just give up your income, give up on your life, and apply for benefits. It\u2019s that simple to join this wonderful club. Anyone can have this if they want it bad enough.\n\nOh wait, what\u2019s that? You can\u2019t? What do you mean you can\u2019t quit your job? Why not? You mean you\u2019d rather keep your job income than be on government benefits? Hmm\u2026\n\nIsn\u2019t it interesting how so many people pretend to be envious of \u201clazy\u201d government leeches yet none of them would ever think of choosing to become one. Anyone in their right mind who has earned income would choose to stay that way if they can. The thought of giving up income to live off of benefits is inconceivable because they know their quality of life would be so much worse if they chose to depend on government benefits.\n\nBeing on food stamps is not a desirable life goal for most people.

            "selftext": "I (24F) made shepherd's pie recently from a recipe online, which said to mix about 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese in the mashed potato topping that goes on top of the meat. My mom (63F) has rarely put cheese in her mouth and claims she despises cheese and that it disgusts her, and that she can't stand the sight, smell, taste, etc., of it. She does love other forms of dairy like yogurt, butter, etc. On occasion, she has accidentally ingested some in some of her favorite foods, including garlic bread which she did not know could possibly include cheese.\n\nShe had some of the shepherd's pie I made because she loves anything with beef and potatoes, and she ended up absolutely loving it and went for seconds. She wanted to make some herself and I told her the recipe but I omitted the 1/4 cup parmesan because it looked like she was really excited to make it so I felt bad and didn't want to crush her spirit by telling her there's cheese in the original recipe.\n\nShe ended up making it without the parmesan, she said it was really good, but she did tell me that the potato topping tasted a bit \"off\" or \"different\" and I told her the original one I made, the one she ate, had parmesan in it. She immediately tilted over, losing balance and grabbed the kitchen counter and put her hand on her forehead as if about to lose consciousness and she got extremely disgusted.\n\nEdit: someone suggested i post an edit. Someone asked if I served it to her, I didn't, I walking in on her already having some with my dad who most likely offered her some. He probably saw the dish on the counter cooling down and served himself some if he thought it looked good, he doesnt care too much about the ingredients and probably couldnt figure right away that there was any obvious cheese in there, as she couldnt seem to tell either. I felt bad about interrupting her while she ate because it looked like she was really enjoying it",

                "NTA - anyone who says they <blanket statement> hate ALL cheese is full of shit. There are literally 1000s of varieties of cheese - just because they don't like the few basic ones they've ever tried, doesn't mean they wouldn't like others. They just gave up before they found them.\n\nI used to be married to a guy who, as a young child, decided he no longer liked cheese. Of any type. At all. And yet, he loved cream cheese frosting (as long as he didn't know that's what it was), and my best friend's family \"tricked\" him into eating roasted potatoes tossed with parmesan (which he raved about, although that wasn't cool of them). \n\nThe kicker was when we went to a cheese shop that had samples. I was obviously in heaven, and he went because I wanted to go. When we got to the \"cheese fudge\" (no, idk what that means, but it was tasty), he ate a sample before I could tell him what it was. He told me how much he enjoyed it, and I verified multiple times that he meant it. Then I told him. His reply? \"Oh, I was just being polite.\" Dude...\n\nDisliking cheese had literally become his sole distinguishing personality trait by that point, so he couldn't possibly fathom that part of his identity being threatened. It was the only thing that made him unique, so he held onto it with every fiber of his being.\n\nNot the only reason we're divorced, but you get the idea...\n\nAnyway, OP, since you didn't \"trick\" your mom into eating cheese, you're definitely NTA.

Another comment mentioned cooking something with ground up cat (which made me very disturbed), but it did sway my opinion. If you were a vegetarian because you had an aversion towards eating animals and you started to eat a dish that you didn\u2019t realize had meat in it, wouldn\u2019t you be upset if the person who cooked it didn\u2019t tell you there was meat in it when they saw you eating it?

My mom (63F) has rarely put cheese in her mouth and claims she despises cheese and that it disgusts her, and that she can't stand the sight, smell, taste, etc., of it. On occasion, she has accidentally ingested some in some of her favorite foods, including garlic bread which she did not know could possibly include cheese. \n\nShe had some of the shepherd's pie I made because she loves anything with beef and potatoes, and she ended up absolutely loving it and went for seconds. She wanted to make some herself and I told her the recipe but I omitted the 1/4 cup parmesan because it looked like she was really excited to make it so I felt bad and didn't want to crush her spirit by telling her there's cheese in the original recipe. \n\nShe ended up making it without the parmesan, she said it was really good, but she did tell me that the potato topping tasted a bit \"off\" or \"different\" and I told her the original one I made, the one she ate, had parmesan in it. She immediately tilted over, losing balance and grabbed the kitchen counter and put her hand on her forehead as if about to lose consciousness and she got extremely disgusted and ended up not making the version without cheese. \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Although Corfu and Puglia are interesting blends of both traditions.\nGreeks have some sort of pasta too, but its origin is probably because of ancient times.\nI read that Etruscans and Greek Italians (Italiotes) used to make the ancestor of pasta millenia ago.\n\nItaly (along with Spain) is the most biodiverse country in Europe, because of [latitude](https://reddit.com/r/MapPorn/s/cLiU6rZnjk), but Spain also has the help of the Canaries and enclaves of North African territory.\n\nFrance too if we consider Corsica, Guyana and the islands, but if we consider the Mainland alone then not that much.",

We made the decision to go small on the wedding and save for a house downpayment so we had a small backyard wedding, 32 guests including kids, and kept things on the cheaper on. Total cost, including dress, was under $6000. I'm happy with our decision, I'm the only groom that I know that actually enjoyed my wedding and I think our wedding was beautiful. It had a lower key and more intimate, friendly vibe that I know my SIL who had a huge wedding said she wished hers had.\n\nOur food selection was fruit cocktails and pigs in a blanket for appetizers. Our entrees were from 2 restaurants and we had American Chinese food (general tsos chicken, beef lomain, and sweet and sour chicken) and fried chicken from a well known local market. For desert we had a bakery make 3 sheet cakes of different flavors, all topped with mousse icing. We chose food that my wife and I are fond of and that we knew everyone would enjoy. \n\nMy coworker called backyard weddings in general trashy but really went hard on our food choice, calling it white trash to have our selection. He said weddings are suppose to be fancy and the food should be something that people don't get to eat often. He said we were rude hosts for serving \"commener food\" at a formal affair.\n\nI laughed at him because the notion that a wedding has to be fancy is ridiculous, I don't understand why people think weddings have to be a certain way. A wedding is suppose to be a celebration of a formal union between people in love, and those people can celebrate it in any way they want.

            "selftext": "This was 20+ years ago but I'll never forget it! \nI used to work in the office of a manufacturing plant. There was a group of us (4 females) that would pitch in to buy lunch stuff to hold us through the week. We would make a list on Friday and one of us (usually me) would shop on Monday morning and bring it in with us. \nWe even brought in a sandwich maker and toaster to keep us from getting bored. We had been doing this for months when suddenly the food wouldn't last through the week. The first time we chalked it up to us being hungrier than normal and moved on. By week 3, we decided that we just need to buy more stuff and we did. But again, it ran out fast and we were really confused. \nOne day I went to grab something from the break room and there are all our bags on the table and the plant manager making a ridiculously large sandwich!! When I asked what she was doing, she said making a sandwich. I asked if anyone told her that she could make lunch from our stash. She said no and went on to say she found these bags of groceries and had been doing it for weeks!! I let her know that the groceries were ours because we were trying to save money but now we know why our food was running out so fast. She's said she didn't know they were ours. She just thought someone bought them for everyone. I asked why she didn't find out who they belonged to first and she looked at me like a deer in headlights. \nWhen I let my coworkers know, they were pissed!! One of them said she knew they were our groceries because she had asked my coworker why she had so much food one day. We stopped the lunch group that week and started bringing food from home. \nA couple weeks later, the plant manager asked me where our groceries were. I let her know that we couldn't afford to keep feeding people that made more than we did.\n Edit: time because I left there in 2002 and didn't math right \ud83e\udd74",

                "That is some crazy entitlement. The fact that she was asking about the groceries AFTER you had already told her it was yours means she fully intended to keep robbing you. Thats crazy. \n\nThe craziest story I ever heard about entitled food thieves was from my BF. \n\nHis mom works in a school and was telling some of the teachers about how my BF did some video editing for fun. This entitled teacher then volunteered him to come in and film AND edit a video of all the staff dancing to Gangnam style (the trend at the time). He didn't want to do it but against his better judgment decided to go in for 1 day, and 1 day only. \n\nHe brought his lunch and a chocolate milk in, and was told to put it in the staff fridge. He then spent all morning chasing teachers around because no one was ready or prepared and people kept wandering off. He finally gave up and said he would film after lunch but if they weren't ready he was leaving. \n\nHe then discovered his lunch gone. Upon returning to the gym to film, he sees the same entitled teacher drinking chocolate milk. He asked her where she got it, and she says \"I just found it in the fridge...\" He tells her that was a part of his lunch and she goes \"oh the sandwich was great, you should bring another when you come back tomorrow, I always hate my salad...\". \n\nThis is literally too much entitlement for me to process, my head just spins in anger like the exorcist girl when he tells it.",

(12 to 1, nurse and provider got lunch 1-2 to compensate).\n\nSo a drug company bought the clinic lunch and had it delivered at 12. I had the Lunch shift so i was told \"there will be plenty left\" ....I come into the break room at 1pm and all the food was gone.

So we have a large glass door fridge.  On 1 side is the stuff anyone can help themselves too, and on the other side is anything that people bring in for themselves and put in there.

Lots of lamington cakes and chocolate cakes, and I can't stand coconut or chocolate flavouring so I never had any. Rolls around to my birthday and my whole team pitched in for a giant cake for me, which was super-kind. Went for a white sponge, jam and cream, pink buttercream, all of my loves. Brought it out to sing happy birthday to me as a team, just a lovely moment. I had to race off to a meeting afterwards to come back to find one of our casual staff with the entire last quarter of the cake, eating it off the cake tray. He was on first lunch, so not only did I miss out on my own dang cake, so did the second lunch shift - it turned out he'd already cut himself a quarter of the cake first, and had it while the others were eating lunch, before they went out for a smoke break, and helped himself to the rest. His excuse? \"I forgot to pack lunch.\" Shrug. A half sheet cake!",
                "Years ago, I worked in a large office of 100+ people. We would constantly experience food disappearing from the break room refrigerators. My lunch was stolen a few times. It was upsetting. Finally, one day, a new employee went to the kitchen to grab coffee and he caught the cleaning lady helping herself to his lunch, right out of his tupperware!!!! He screamed at her, demanding to know what she thought she was doing. She freaked out and ran out of the break room, after tossing his container onto the floor. She literally fled the office. HR realized that she had been the lunch thief all along and fired her. The woman cried and begged to keep her job, explaining she stole food because she was starving, but the owner was pissed and so were the employees. They told her that she could have asked for help or gone to food banks instead of stealing from her co-workers. It wasn\u2019t right to leave others without lunch because she claimed to be struggling. I felt bad, but they fired her and did not give her another chance.",

Of course, we had our moochers, but nothing like a certain manager who'd be picking at the food as soon as we unwrapped it, and would help himself to several large plates a day.  We never understood how he knew, since his department was nowhere near the salon. \n\nLater, we discovered our salon manager (who never contributed so much as a corn chip) would run down through every management office and invite them *all* to fill up a plate.

They tried to claim nobody would eat something that hot.\n\nThe joke was on them, I was on a pepper kick and ate the current days even hotter sandwich in front of them, after warning them of the scoville unit level (about 650k) in case anybody was sensitive to it.  I then also mentioned that theft was supposed to be an automatic termination offense since we handled people's financial information all day and asked for the guy to be fired.\n\nHR left me alone after that, and word went around to not steal my food for the sake of your GI tract.",

                "Ugh, this reminds me of a time in grad school when I was at a hospital training site. We were told that it was cool to keep our lunches in the fridge that the nurses used, which was located in the multipurpose room that hosted the nurses taking their breaks, general floor meetings, random students studying, etc. This particular day I had placed only a single container of yogurt in the fridge.\n\nI finally get a chance to eat so I made my way to the fridge. There is a nurse\u2019s meeting happening in the room so I tiptoe in with the goal of grabbing my yogurt as quickly and quietly as possible.  I open the fridge door,  look at the spot I left the yogurt, but it\u2019s not there. Weird.  I can\u2019t really say or do much given the meeting but I shuffle the contents of the fridge around a bit in a fruitless search for my dairy goodness, hoping it just got shoved out of the way. No luck. \n\nI\u2019m getting some serious side-eye from nurses at this point for both the interruption and the noise, and in response I tried to give them my best apologetic expression. \n\nBut then suddenly I zero in on one unpleasant-looking * nurse bringing a fat spoonful of MY FUCKING YOGURT to her mouth. Oh hell no this bitch did not take my yogurt! I stare at her until she looks at me, at which point I narrow my eyes and give her a LOOK that makes it clear that I\u2019m *oissed*. She has the decency to look sheepish for a fleeting moment as she looks down at the yogurt and connected the dots, but then she remembered that she was a nurse and I was a lowly student intern. She quickly regained her nastiness and there was nothing I could do. I left with my tail tucked in defeat & found myself a food truck to soothe my wounds.  \n\n*Refers to her facial expression, not her beauty",

I shared when co-workers asked (or didn\u2019t ask, but didn\u2019t make it to payday -we\u2019ve *all* been there).  When I left that job, I put the box o\u2019heart attack under one girl\u2019s desk with a note saying they were now hers.

Like typing 50 labels to just one person, over and over and not adding anything to the envelopes, just seal and mail. Ok, whatever. \n\nIt was late Friday evening and I got off at 12.  My coworker wouldn\u2019t be in until the following Tuesday at 8 pm as it was a 3 day holiday. She left an apple, a cookie and half a PBJ.  I ate the sandwich and cookie and planned to replace them for her on Tuesday. The apple would stay fresh so I left that. A couple of hours later I was so high I couldn\u2019t walk. Had my BF pick me up because I couldn\u2019t drive. I was not a stranger to that kind of high but didn\u2019t care for it. I just wasn\u2019t a weed smoker and was trying to figure out when I smoked a joint that\u2019s how confused and high I was. I told her what I did and she laughed and forgot that she left a laced cookie at work.  This is a perfect reason to never eat your coworkers food.  The cookie was really a waste on me just because I didn\u2019t like a weed high. I offered to give her some money but she was a hippie and declined my offer and thought it was funny.

Thankfully we had cameras in our trucks and found that probably one of the richest and most well respected local  celebrities had literally taken  them off the truck and put them in her trunk to take for her own child's party. \n\nShe thought the frozen cakes would survive 90+ degree weather in the trunk of her ridiculously over priced Bentley for the 2+ hours they were in there.\n\nThe inside of the trunk looked like a Jackson Pollack painting \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23",

He got called into the VP's office and he wanted to know why my brother was stealing food and they installed cameras in the breakroom to catch the food thief (it was not my brother).  They fired him on the spot for taking two bites of the cake and thinking of course he was the thief.  I laugh about this today because you really gotta fuck up to get fired for eating cake..

I was amazed we could order into a little \u201cdrive-in movie\u201d speaker and get served a full hot meal while sitting in our car in a little slot.  \n\nBut it wasn\u2019t as fun as road trip picnics in a small town park while my mom made sandwiches from items in the ice chest and dad took a nap.  As we ate, our parents would look at the AAA maps or the Mobile Oil Atlas and pick out the next NPS/USFS/BLM/State campground to stay at.  Back then our public-lands campgrounds were not crowded and one could just drive in and find a spot. \n\nThe only times we did not \u201cpicinik\u201d was when it was raining/snowing so we\u2019d stop at a local diner.  We still never stayed in motels but would put up the Army green canvas tent in the rain. \n\nAt home in SoCal we rarely ate out except for birthdays at Bob\u2019s Big Boy, the beach Orange Julius after sand got into our homemade sandwiches, at Disneyland, and going to supper clubs while visiting relatives.   I know there were Jack in the Box stands in the 50s/60s but our parents called it \u201cGag in the Bag\u201d and would drive by, saying \u201cyou\u2019d rather have a tuna-fish sandwich at home.\u201d  By the time we got home it\u2019d be dinner-time lol so no lunch ever happened.  \n\nThe first time I ever set foot into a McDonalds was during college in the 70s.  The quarter-pounder was indeed yummy but the coffee was to die for.  \n\nAnd yes, we ate cantaloupe with a stainless cutlery spoon which was kept in the Coleman metal container next to the Coleman ice chest, all in the Bel Air trunk.",

This is actually pretty scary and I can't imagine   how this will affect the image of Indians in Canada, which is already severely tarnished.\n\nSo apparently   international students, primarily from India, are making Youtube videos   on how to take stuff from food banks in Canada. From what I know, food banks in Western countries are available for local vulnerable citizens   and not for international students who want use them as a cost saving measure. Not to mention that it's a massive immigration violation as  one  must prove that they have sufficient funds to study and live in  Canada  without relying on social welfare programs. Also, the resources  at food  banks in Canada are severely stretched out due to inflation.\n\nThis  is pretty disgusting that most of these people in these videos are  international students who are presenting it as a cost saving measure.  Here are some examples:\n\n[Video 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfogy5kcfCU) This the most popular one.\n\n\u00a0Here are some other examples below as well:\n\n[Video 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzUIodfO7Oc) [Video 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox5sKwiO6Tw) [Video 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXcSusR_OOc) [Video 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0g-QNC7VxM) [Video 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DItAV5PJBQA) [Video 7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jR2n-DqsutE) [Video 8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyZiMuw7N94)[ ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyZiMuw7N94)[Video 9](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaBIOj30aj4) [Video 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrCa4UN9__U) [Video 11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDSLL4ZDl8A)[ ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDSLL4ZDl8A)[Video 12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv3nwR7tCSc) [Video 13](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/zNDujvq1XB4)\n\n[Video 14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xblq2zAYqpM) [Video 15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swgR0ry_CnU)\n\nAnd   now Canadians are starting to respond to such videos as well since  this  type of abusive is becoming mroe and more widespread. For example,  you  have [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BISFOw5TfUw) and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P21NUNG6120).\n\nThe   person who sent me this also told me that there is a massive increase   in racial tensions between the Indian community and the  Anglo-Canadians.  A lot of this is because there is a massive difference  between the  cultures of India and Canada. And the fact that  international students  from here are not only abusing these food banks  but openly making videos  bragging about how much food they got. In some  of the comment sections  you see sad stories from Canadian born people  on how they're disabled  and rely on food banks to eat, and due to  international students abusing  the system, they can go hungry anyday.\n\nThe   worst part about it is that Canadian government isn't doing anything   about it and the Indian government isn't doing anything either.  This is   seriously going to harm India's image overseas. Both governments  should  definitely do something to stop this fraud. Stuff like this  contributes  to more division and hatred.",

I used to volunteer with my schools food pantry\n\nThe food banks are usually meant for anyone who is having trouble getting groceries for meals, either because of the cost or because of a lot of other reasons (not having transportation to get to a grocery store, not being able to find healthy food options, not having the time, etc.). It was explicitly no questions asked because means testing for programs like this leave out a lot of people who would take advantage of it. They often had surpluses of food and the food was typically basic, but persishable produce and simple starches.  They would rather have students who didn't strictly need it take it. \nBesides, grocery inflation has been particularly bad this year and even people who work full time and get raises are feeling the pinch. I imagine that students who receive a fixed stipend, or rely on their parents to send them money in rupees are struggling even more. If getting some free food allows them to more comfortably afford rent or other bills, then the system is working as intended. \n\n\nThe one at my school explicitly was set up for students and made it a point to mention that you didn't need id or need to be a citizen, and I've never heard of a food bank/pantry requiring that.",

                "Copypasting my comment from your other post in a different sub.  \n\nMuch of this outrage is nonsense. Majority of Indian international students don't do stuff like that. There are also food banks that are meant for students only which are located on university campuses. At my uni, most people who use food banks are international students of several nationalities, not just Indian. In fact, I notice SEA, Latinos, and East Asians the most. There are fees in the tuition specifically for food banks. I haven't watched all 15 videos yet but if the ones you linked are showcasing taking resources from food banks meant for the homeless, then I agree that it's really bad. I just don't think it's that prevalent at all.\n\nCost of living has gotten really bad in Canada and there is no help for international students. Instead universities, landlords exploit them by increasing the dues to be paid each year by a lot (international students paying 3-4 times as much as a local, along with taxes from all Canadian residents helps keep the education for the locals a lot cheaper) and the employers exploit them by underpaying them. Especially after covid, you can see how some middle class students who rely on loans can be burdened. I checked out the two Canadian responses and both of those guys are just right wing bigots. They don't give a shit about poor people. If they did, they would'nt be actively supporting policies that cuck the working class of Canada. Anti-immigrant sentiment throughout history has always been used to scapegoat immigrants as the main cause of all economic problems of a country.\n\nI think there is truth to the argument that Canada is allowing diploma mills to lure in international students and such increased immigration has negative impact on housing. But these issues are severly exaggerated. For example, many properties in Vancouver are bought by MNCs to rent which has contributed to the housing crisis. But the scapegoat here mainly will be international students. Not the MNCs or NIMBYs who oppose any housing project. I am still grateful to be in the position I am even though I am in a huge debt because at least I have the means to clear it after my education but being an international student is not all sunshine and roses.

Is it because the minimum wage is higher, or some sort of tax difference? Is it because Australians are more health conscious or care about presentation and taste more? Or is it something else?",

Boy, were we dissapointed from the food and additionally almost broke when we had returned home. That day I learned to go where the locals go and avoid tourist traps!\n\nAbout 20 years ago, when I visited the Emilia Romana at least once a year and I seldom ate pizza or (the usual) pasta when we were guests of the MC we where friends with. We never went to tourist places to eat and always visited the restaurants the locals go to. I probably had the best (genuine) northern italian food ever. I also have problems with nightshade fruits, like Tomatoes, Bell peppers, etc. Still I didn't had to starve.\n\nHowever, when I visited the US, the girl I met there, wanted to eat at an italian restaurant, but I declined because their menue read like a shortened version of the menue at any Bella Italia here in Germany. I asked to eat at an american restaurant instead. She was a bit baffled and said that she made that suggestion because she thought it would be a fancy unusual place for me. I told her about me living about 2 hours from (the real) italy and that there are probably more italian restaurants in Munich than in all of Pennsylvania.\n\nDon't get me wrong, a Bella Italia Restaurant isn't a tourist trap nor a rip off chain.

                "\u201cOn a recent evening, the Star watched a mad scramble among couriers at Union Station, who \u2014 as soon as their train\u2019s platform was announced minutes before departure \u2014 quickly piled their bikes on elevators and dashed to secure a coveted spot.\u201d\n\n  \nThe article links to this thread and the images of couriers at Union is wild.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/gotransit/comments/14v59qw/union\\_station\\_last\\_night/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gotransit/comments/14v59qw/union_station_last_night/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cBedi, who delivers for more than one company, said he commutes earlier to avoid the rush of couriers who typically arrive downtown late in the morning and head back to the suburbs late at night.\n\nWhen he first started delivering last September, he said it wasn\u2019t as hard to find a spot for his bike. He attributes the recent increase in delivery workers to Canada\u2019s decision to lift the 20-hour weekly work cap for international students last November, a policy which, unless extended, will expire at the end of 2023.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor now, some couriers wait hours, watching several trains pass, before they can board, according to Vivek Dharmin, a 20-year-old Uber Eats courier and computer programming student. He said he once lost five hours of work because he couldn\u2019t nab a spot.\n\nDharmin, who came to Canada in May from India, originally expected to work somewhere like McDonald\u2019s, but food delivery became his only option because of a shortage of jobs in Brampton.\n\nSo far, he\u2019s ambivalent about his new home. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of good,\u201d a smiling Dharmin said after arriving at Union Station one recent morning. \u201cNot as good as I expected.\u201d Someone had just stolen a bike he had recently bought for work. An exception among his peers who mostly ride e-bikes, Dharmin said he can\u2019t afford to buy or rent one like Bedi. Both hope they won\u2019t be in the delivery game for long.  \nBedi wants to find a job in the trades, one that offers consistent pay and would help him qualify for permanent residency. With so many people eating out during summer, he said he often makes less than minimum wage: only $100 a day, minus the cost of transit (about $11 per day), and renting his e-bike ($200 per month).\n\nDharmin\u2019s not so sure he\u2019ll stick around at all. \u201cI think I\u2019m going back to India,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to stay here.\u201d There are too many people in his home country, he added, but you can easily find a job.\u201d",
                "Recent trip corroborates this. Coming in from Guelph (with a bike!) there were a lot of delivery guys who wanted to board at Brampton, and it was an issue since the limit is two bikes per car... a guy got on with us, although we already had two bikes and said he'd risk the fine -- that they rarely checked.",

Having to commute far enough to need a go train to deliver food isn\u2019t ideal but what option would someone who needs to do that have? \n\nYou put them in a car and it\u2019s horrible for the environment and traffic coming down from outside the GTA. \n\nI agree that there are just too many bikes but the problem is deeper.",
                "I take the GO everyday with my bike out of the city. It seems like there are basically no food couriers coming in from the west on the lakeshore line, however it still seems to be a mad dash to get a spot. Half the time there is someone sitting in the bike spot without a bike, or there is a bike or two there already. I've had people get pretty upset when I put my bike directly in front of them when they are sitting in one of those spots, so I try to avoid it. All this could be alleviated with a bike coach. All the cyclists could stand at a designated spot on the platform, which would allow for more bikes as well as allowing them during rush hour . The biggest issue with regional transit is that you have to get from the station to your destination. With the uptick in popularity of ebikes and other forms of micromobility this is becoming less of an issue, however the bottle neck is the train design and policies of Metrolinx.",

A bike capable of going that fast should not be unlicensed and ininsured, only a matter of time until they cause a collision or injure someone on the sidewalk. I'm not salty over people trying to make a living wage, but it shouldn't be done with suck reckless behaviour.\n\nBasically we have: a competitive gig market in which the worker who is more reckless and saves more time is going to be able to make a better living; no regulations (at least not enforced from what I've seen) for what these bikers can and can't do; and more people than there are jobs with liveable wages, which all results in just way too many of these bikes roaming around going YOLO.\n\nAll that is to say, perhaps if there were more stringent regulations, we would have less e-bikers requiring GO trains. And even more so, perhaps if immigration targets were geared towards skilled workers, rather than unskilled ones who rely on the gig economy to make a living, we wouldn't have such an over saturation of e-bikers riding around or requiring GO trains. Or alternatively, if the government needs these immigration targets set to high to provide a work force for the future, they should already have the jobs readily available for these individuals coming in, rather than saying come now and we'll figure out the plan later. \n\nLong rant, but yeah having to share a sidewalk with people going upwards of 40km/h on an e-bike has made me a bit tilted on the matter.",

The countries that have supposedly good cuisine are usually a combination of coastal, historically heavily agricultural over industrial and usually closer to the equator.\n\nBeing close to the equator usually means there's a larger variety of foods that can be grown, most of the year round. Which means there's a lower emphasis on growing subsistence crops, like potatoes. \n\nindustrial history also generally means the emphasis on cooking shifts to hearty and stodgy meals, that can be prepared quickly. Rather than more time consuming and ingredient rich meals that more agriculturally diverse cultures tended to favour.\n\nThe UK specifically is a fairly small archipelago where a lot of land isn't suitable for farming. The space we have was usually occupied with subsistence staples like grain, pulses, tubors and root veg.

                "There are certainly times when delivery is necessary, but I have found the current state of DoorDash and the like has just allowed people to be lazy. Personally, I just don't understand it and I also feel less inclined to use things like that when we know the individuals doing the work are getting paid shit to do it. I also felt similarly during COVID with InstantCart. I know some people need services like that and that's totally fine, but asking another individual to effectively put their health at risk to get my groceries just felt wrong. We have a local food delivery service around me and I'm more inclined to use them over a national company like DoorDash because I think they pay their delivery drivers better.",

My 15 minutes of walking or driving somewhere isn't worth the 200% markup. I'm often busy but I've never felt _that_ busy. I'd honestly feel embarrassed having someone bring me my own lunch. It feels \"bougie\" in all the negative ways to my brain. \n\nC) I try not to eat much \"fast food\" and when I do want to eat out, a lot of the time I want to have the _experience_ of eating out.

These apps raise the menu prices and tack on a ton of other fees so you're paying nearly triple (before tip!) in some cases than you would if you just hopped your lazy ass in the car and picked it up yourself. Not only that, I also have to factor in these apps taking my information and selling it for even more money. This is why I don't use apps for fast food or restaurants ... sure, I'll get a free burger every once in a while, but I earned that $8 burger by letting you sell my info for $$$$.

I really wanted it and didn\u2019t care if I had to pay a little extra. \n\nThe food was cold because it took about 40 minutes to get my order. In addition to the delivery fee we are still expected to tip? All said and done the meal which would have been $8 if I went in person was $30. Never again.",

There was this one local service I used to use sometimes that had a fee of something like $6 per delivery, and that seemed a bit much.\n\nTo pay $85 including all the fees and tip for what would be a $50 order if I picked it up, I find that really hard to justify unless I'm pretty desperate. What I find most offensive is that you'll start an order and they'll be like \"$2.99 delivery fee!\" and you'll get to the end and it'll be like \"$2.99 delivery fee + $12 service fee + $8 tip + $7.50 restaurant fee.\" Whatever, I'm not playing that game.",

The tipping (haha) point was the day I decided to order a pizza from a local place through DD and it took over FOUR EFFING HOURS to get to me because the restaurant apparently lost my order and kept telling both me and the driver \"it's coming up, it's coming up.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow I'll only order delivery if it's a restaurant's own people because at least the food prices are the same (even if there's a delivery fee that doesn't go to the driver).

They usually only charge 0.75\u20ac for gas and then 1-3\u20ac for delivery. There\u2019s also no tipping here. Uber Eats is also here and they are a ripoff. Tried to charge me full price for cancelling an order immediately after placing and then fixing my order. I ordered almost the exact same thing and they lied saying the restaurant had already made the food. Literally charged me full price for food I didn\u2019t get. PayPal refunded me and now they say I still owe them. So I\u2019ll never use them again. \n\nIf I were in the states I\u2019d never use Door Dash or grub hub. The prices are jacked up. The fees are insane and you\u2019re expected to tip. Then your food is cold or missing items. \n\nJust order from places that actually deliver.

I also have a job where I cannot leave whenever I need to. I am a Pilates instructor and need to be with clients all day. So while I recognize that I am paying more to use DoorDash, I really enjoy the convenience and peace of mind of knowing that I can easily get anything I need, any time.\n\nAlso, I have found their customer service to be great.

During the pandemic I got a discount for being a Healthcare employee but that has gone away and now I'm over it. Every two weeks on payday my coworkers and I used to doordash lunch. (I always put it on my card to enjoy the cash back rewards and they'd give me cash so I could give my kids lunch money for school ha ha). Now, one of us just goes and picks it up. \n\nOn the other hand though, if a place doesn't offer online ordering I dont bother lol",

Where I live (small city, \\~1,000,000 people in the area) the wait time is usually double what it would take to just go and pick up a to go order myself. I can understand using them if you can't make the trip yourself but if it's a consistent, regular schedule, I think an alternative such as preparing meals ahead of time would a much better solution.",

Sometimes I get home and realize I'm tired, and the wife's tired, neither of us want to cook, she doesn't want to get back in the car and again, no one but pizza places deliver around here, so we order. \n\n\nHonestly I use DD/UE more than I like,  but it is what it is.",

I've also noticed that restaurants near me charge a good deal higher prices for things bought through the app vs just calling them.  \n\nCompanies like uber and lyft are worthwhile simply because they're straight up better than dealing with taxi companies directly, but using a middleman for pickup / delivery?  No thank you.",

I do my best to cook meals at home because they\u2019re cheaper, and frankly taste better. A combo meal and some McNuggets cost almost $20 alone without the delivery fees.\n\nI have friends that use nothing but home delivery for groceries and food delivery services though, so I think it\u2019s more of a preference than generational thing. At least from my experience.",

They're just living the values we taught them.",
                "I don't mind delivery if it's from the restaurant itself, like delivery chinese or pizza, but I have never done a door dash or uber eats. Way too expensive and don't want someone dipping their dong in my queso bc they are mad about a tip. \n\nI'm pissed that our local Donatos pizza is using door dash now.

                "It\u2019s especially annoying because we grew up with actual delivery from Italian and some Chinese restaurants. The only time I used it, the driver had another person in the car. They just stopped the car in the middle of the street by my house; which is clearly numbered and easy to find. I had to walk up to the car, and the passenger handed me the food. They were both very confused, and I don\u2019t know how they handed it to me with a straight face. The food was literally upside down and the sauce was all over the bag. I don\u2019t know if they were high or stupid. I put on a complaint to Uber Eats, and they told me to take it up with the restaurant. Never again. I don\u2019t trust the process. \n\nUnless you\u2019re intoxicated, is it really that hard to roll up to a drive thru?",

Anything crispy and fried is a soggy nightmare by the time it arrives at your door. Order a burger, all the vegetable toppings and the patty all wind up the same temperature, the bun starts getting soggy. Most foods can\u2019t realistically be delivered and maintain their quality. \n\nPizza on the other hand. By the time it arrives it\u2019s the perfect temperature ready to be enjoyed. \n\nThe real tragedy is with my acid reflux I can\u2019t really enjoy pizza anymore.

Mostly because:\n\nA) if I'm going to eat food at home, I'd rather make it myself\n\nB) if it's something I can't or don't like to cook, I'd rather go out wholesale for it; I like going out to eat for more than just the food\n\nC) my dogs freak the fuck out when unknown elements enter their sphere of interest, which is generally the steps up to the door; therefore, I basically end up waiting for the delivery driver so I can intercept them in the driveway, which feels like I might as well have gone out to pick it up myself anyway",

Even if I want something special that's only 20 minutes away from my house.\n\nI'm not going to pay someone extra money because I'm too lazy to get off the couch. I'm also certainly not going to do it in light of all of those videos where these delivery drivers are getting pissed because they aren't tipped enough.

                "The one time I tried one of those services, we were both tired and wanted an easy family meal. We ordered from Wing Stop which is across town, about 10-15min drive each way. It was during Covid lockdowns so the driver left it on the porch and left. Once we got it inside we realized that half the order was missing. The order was closed out in the app and there was no way to contact the driver or get my tip back. Opened a ticket with the delivery service but there was no live help. We finally called the store and they found that the driver had left an entire bag of food there. My husband wound up driving up there himself to retrieve it. Meanwhile our kids were getting tired, grumpy, and hungry. Everything was cold by the time we finally sat down to eat. Such a hassle and a total waste of money. Never again.\n\nWe do still order delivery from our local pizza restaurant because they employ their own delivery drivers. But if a restaurant says Doordash or whatever we go get it ourselves.",

I sat there after I got notifications from Instacart, embarrassed that another person was shopping for me) Uber eats and all those, I\u2019ve never used.  Even just straight Uber.

They squeeze restaurants and drivers for as much money as possible, to the point that local legislations have to pass laws about how they can even operate and what they can charge. The end users pay more for a product already produced on razor thin margins. Drivers get a tip out while the cooks and staff, the people making your food, receive zero tips. It almost always takes longer to get your food than if you just got it yourself, and frequently a worse product. Restaurants only offer the third party services because most are desperate for any revenue stream, even at reduced rates. \n\nIn Portland the response from a handful of restaurants is to finally offer their own delivery system, or use an ethical local one like CCC the bike delivery company.

I use Ubereats or Doordash a few times a year now and have no desire to change that. I've lost a lot of weight, and started exercising and now I prefer to just either cook myself or go out to places and eat. \n\nWhile I don't think the service is worth it for the most part when I lived in more isolated area without a car I really appreciated these services because there wasn't much interesting in my local area and it was much more difficult to get to most restaurants.",

So yeah, slightly younger millennial mindset, add lack of car and living in the city and you\u2019ve got a convenience fee that far too many are simply willing to pay. \n\nHell, Seattle has a notorious Taco Bell (1 of 3 in the whole city) that has menu items priced 2-5 times higher than any other store (talking $11.07 for a Crunchwrap). Guess why that is? Well, no one really knows, but it\u2019s speculated that part of it is because customers using Door Dash or Eat24 are already used to seeing a more expensive version of the same menu, so even if the store does half the amount of business as their competing stores, their profit margins are just fine.",

The quality of the food/how it holds up really depends on where you're ordering from (fast food holds up better if you go get it yourself; our sit-down Indian, Middle Eastern, sushi, etc. restaurants hold up really well in delivery) and the general service in your area (and where I live - part of a greater metro area - it's pretty good). \n\nIt's not something I'd do multiple times a week (ideally, it's a once a month thing, if that - some months just suck more than others), but there are definitely days I don't feel like cooking or driving to get something. \n\nI also get groceries delivered these days. It was something I'd never tried until Covid and stay at home orders hit.

It was meant to serve 8, and there were 4 of us (2 adults, 2 kids), so we knew it would be too much food but figured we could eat it for lunches as well. \nAnyway, when the \u201cdelivery\u201d arrived, it was only the bag with the utensils and condiments and none of the food. We reported it and decided to have it re-delivered. The new driver called when he picked up the food and let us know that they had given him not only the new order but also the food from the previous order when the restaurant hadn't given the other driver. He wanted to make sure we hadn\u2019t accidentally ordered twice. Since I knew there is no way we could eat all that food, I asked if he would want the extra order, and he accepted. It turns out one order was way more food than we had anticipated, so the other order definitely would have gone to waste otherwise. \nMy husband says it was weird and insulting because nobody wants our leftovers. But they weren't leftovers. It was fresh food, and we would have wasted it. So, I'm asking, from the perspective of a doordash driver, was what if did weird and/or insulting?\n\nUpdate: I just showed my husband your response, and I believe he has accepted the error in his thinking.

I didn't really want to take the food home, so, much to the embarrassment of my ex, I asked the other guy if he wanted them. He was super grateful, and sat in his car and ate them right away. My ex told me later that he hadn't eaten in 2 days, he had no money until he got paid from this job, and that he was really appreciative.

That's money in his pocket.\n\n\n\nPlus it's not leftovers, it's just an extra meal.",
                "I\u2019d be stoked tbh.",
                "this is not leftovers. It's extra untouched food that will be tossed out otherwise. \n\nLeftovers are what I used to bring the elderly gentleman I used to work for after big family events. I would grab some empty containers, make him up a meal and put it in his fridge. He'd eat it, thank me, and no food went to waste.",
                "I drive for Doordash when I'm short on my bills or don't have cash to buy food/other essentials. There have been times where the restaurants offered me food and I cried for joy. So if a customer did this I would take it as a kind gesture and be very appreciative \ud83d\udc96",
                "Feels like your husband might have wanted to keep the food as a perk but didn't want to look cheap in front of everyone so he just made you feel weird about it? Not at all a strange thing to do and I'm positive that it made your driver's night!",
                "That\u2019s super sweet and would make my day, probably even my week. I doubt anyone doing doordash as a side hustle is filthy rich to the point of being insulted by free food.",
                "Why doesn't this ever happen to me?",
                "Lol why would it be??",
                "as a young doordash driver, the highlights of the job is when i get like a free drink or some free food, so personally if i was offered an entire meal for 8 i\u2019d probably lose my mind with excitement \ud83d\ude02 i don\u2019t think anyone would be upset with getting a free family meal, and none of us would consider them \u201cleftovers\u201d seeing as the bags are sealed for us and straight from the restaurant \ud83d\ude02 you probably made that drivers night \ud83d\ude0c",
                "A nice gesture.",
                "I would be STOKED!! Free food? Hellz yes!",
                "Fuck no. Humans be hungry!",
                "It\u2019s new food not leftovers! As a driver, I would have happily accepted the offer. That was super kind of you!",
                "It\u2019s free food and not a left over. Wtf",
                "Absolutely not! It was very kind and generous! The food wasn't touched by your family and wasn't sitting in your house or possession. If the dasher thought it was wierd or sketchy and didn't want it I'm sure they would of declined your offer.",
                "Dude I would\u2019ve taken that free food in a heartbeat! Zero shame and you were really nice to offer it to him.",
                "I would\u2019ve been so excited.  Who doesn\u2019t love free food?  Definitely wouldn\u2019t be insulted",
                "This was incredibly nice of you!",
                "I\u2019d take free food any day!",
                "That happened to me a couple times. Once it was a free sandwich. Once a pizza. Once pancakes. I\u2019m not even a fan of pancakes. But I was excited every time.",
                "I would have been thrilled as would my hollow leg kids who eat so much it\u2019s insane.",
                "Just had a customer give me one of her extra smoothies the other day... Literally texted 4 people about it as soon as I got back to the car  bc free shit is the best shit \ud83e\udd23 and I feel like if the customer was cool enough to offer it to you.... Then that's a bonus. The only time I'm not super about it is if I just started working... Then I'm usually a good bit from home, but I've detoured to family or friends houses to drop off.. And if I'm in the city, it's full of homeless people, and so far they've always been incredibly grateful for what I've given them.",
                "I always tip and then leave a bag full of cold water, a Gatorade, banana or orange, rice Krispy treat, granola bar, fruit snacks, vitamin c pack and pop tarts for drivers and they\u2019ve never complained or not taken it.  Restaurant food is even better I would think!!!  Very kind of you.",
                "I\u2019d be extremely grateful because even if I didn\u2019t want it I pass by 5-10 homeless people a day so I could feed at least half of em and feel good for the day giving back after getting back",
                "Not insulting!! Oftentimes it can get so busy we don't eat. So it's actually very thoughtful. But I don't think your husband was being rude.",
                "He picked it up. He knew no one picked at it or even opened the bag. Not weird or insult at al. I would have gladly taken the bag and thanked you.",
                "That wasn\u2019t leftovers, it was an entire extra giant portion of food that you guys wouldn\u2019t have been able to eat. It was not only generous of you to give him that, but I also love that you chose to give it to someone who could use it rather than waste it all.",
                "100% the right thing to do. Stay classy!",
                "Bruhhh, I be smellin that pizza while it's in the back of my seat, I been waiting for someone to offer me a piece. \nSometimes when you don't pack a lunch it can be hard as heck to get a chance to stop and grab some food if you're not wanting to miss out on orders, sure a lot of Dashers are feeling the same.\n\n10/10 prob made his day",
                "Free food is good. Especially if it's sealed and bagged. Had you started taking half of your order on hand off, then it would be awkward",
                "If they have a family it was probably a godsend not having to worry about the evening meal for the family.",
                "It\u2019s not weird, but you should probably give it to the first dasher, who likely got fired because of the non delivery report. They prob need the food now.",
                "It's nice but definitely unexpected. I cater to a couple of the big offices during breakfast, and some of them offer food. I'd feel weird accepting food from a family meal. I do get offered small items from restaurants during long waits.",
                "NTA, that was really sweet of you!  So many people would have kept it just because their selfish. As the driver that probably would have made me cry happy tears!",
                "Husband wanted the food for later for sure",
                "Its not weird at all. What\u2019s actually weird is the amount of food restaurants and eating establishments waste on A DAILY BASIS!",
                "I don\u2019t want your food, I want more tip",
                "I routinely give my dasher stuff\u2014I order extra frostys, drinks, cookies, desserts etc etc on top of the tip",
                "It was definitely weird, but it was also an unusual event- and those are usually weird. Hope you tipped the driver too",
                "Why did you have it redelivered for cutlery",
                "Yes, it's weird. To me, as a driver. I've had people offer me weird stuff. After complimenting someone's garden one time, I had them offer \"anything that looks tasty out of the garden\". I've had people offer me food.\n\nIt's weird, I accepted a job, delivered your food, you paid for it, I don't want to be offered anything else. It's not about \"accepting scraps\". It's just that I did a job I was paid to do, agreed to up front, and I don't want anything besides the offer I accepted.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I think your husband is right. It is, maybe it is about \"accepting scraps\". It's a little bit insulting. You obviously had good intentions but, it's just weird. Assuming you left the driver a decent tip, plus he gets his delivery fees, he made maybe $10 on that order. $10 is enough for me to go and buy my own lunch. Something I like. Maybe a turkey sandwich from a good sandwich shop. I don't just want to eat whatever food you ordered, maybe I don't like it, maybe I'd rather have my turkey sandwich... Idk this is a weird situation you're in.\n\nBut I do think your husband is right. I think it's possible that you felt bad for getting free food, so you tried to give it to someone else, and it would make them feel bad for accepting.",
                "Yes. It\u2019s pretty insulting. Don\u2019t give us your trash to throw away. That\u2019s your job. I would have gifted it to a hobo or simply discarded it.",
                "Yum",
                "As a driver that would be absolutely appreciated! Bummer that a mistake happened on your first order, but glad it got resolved. Sometimes I don't get a chance to eat throughout the day, or I don't make enough money to even buy myself lunch throughout the day without losing money. So I would jump up and down for some extra food.",
                "As a driver, I would have been extremely happy and thankful!!!",
                "No as a dasher with severe financial problems I would absolutely appreciate it",
                "I think it\u2019s so nice.",
                "I\u2019d accept it even if it was the unwanted half of one of the family meals lol.",
                "That was really nice from you, keep doing good to others.",
                "Again?!\n\nEvery month",
                "Tell your husband to loosen the grip on his bootstraps.",
                "I don't know how it would be insulting.  It's food.  Everybody eats it.  I'd be pretty happy.  Most likely, I'd drive straight home just so I could store/share the other 87.5% of the food before it went bad.",
                "I got offered an extra bag of Top Ramen once and even though I would have normally from a friend or something, it felt so cheap coming from a stranger I politely declined. For full context it was the \u201cblue\u201d flavor which I didn\u2019t even know existed until 2023. Imma old school Orange, Red, Pink era guy \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",
                "Even if I didn't want the food, the gesture would go a long way. Not weird.",
                "Great TIP..AS A DASHER I SAY THANK YOU..",
                "I've been working over a year doing door dash. I wouldn't mind some food if offered :p. Us dashers gets barely any tips. Plus I do door dash on a bike and riding 20-30 miles with no food in the stomach is def not fun. I can't even make over $100 dollars in a day and get pulled over for carrying orders on a bike all the time. lol Glad to see you not wasting fresh food and  able to make some ones day.",
                "What I want to know is why would the first dasher just pick up a bag of utensils from the store?  Clearly somebody would not order just a set of utensils",
                "If they got to choose they might prefer money but if you are just giving him  the screw up order, they just picked it up, no one was messing with that order.  I can't seeing someone being upset with that even if they didn't want it they would just politely refuse.  Granted you might get the 1 in ten thousand ass hat who everything is an issue but those people don't tend to work for tips,",
                "No offense in offering. They would have said no if it\u2019s something they don\u2019t eat etc.",
                "Not at all, I think that was very nice of you and as a dasher I think that almost all of us, in my opinion would not take that as an insult. After dashing for a while and dropping of yummy food all night I would definetly accept the offer. So tell your husband to shush, your fine lol :)",
                "NTA.... Your husband is a snob, the food was fresh and the driver knows that cause HE PICKED IT UP from the eatery duhhhhh",
                "I live alone so I always order two portions and let the driver take the other, on top of a tip.  \n\nI've always been this way raised in poverty that my family.ily made sure there was always enough food.  I guess it's giving back in a way to appreciate food and the convenience.",
                "Unhealthy attitude from your husband. Not everyone is doing as well as you are, there are plenty of people who will happily take \"leftovers\", especially when they're not even leftovers, just extra food provided in error. And doing something \"weird\" is much preferable to throwing out an entire order for 8 imo.",
                "I woulda tipped cash too but yea that\u2019s a fairly normal offer. They could have easily just said no. \n\nEspecially cuz you\u2019re on vacation and there isn\u2019t much time or space to storage huge meals",
                "I dash part time and it\u2019s usually a situation where I fell short for the week on bills at my job. \nSometimes I am literally dashing just to make money to buy food.\nIf somebody offer me food at this time I\u2019m going to appreciate like crazy.",
                "He appreciate it",
                "I think it\u2019s a nice gesture not rude at all",
                "Only weird person here is your husband. I'd happily take your extra food, probably give it to my bestie's family or a homeless person if nothing else.",
                "I wouldn\u2019t even be offended if i delivered the one order and y\u2019all were like \u201cHey there\u2019s an extra chicken sandwich in here, do you want it?\u201d",
                "I leave a cooler with drinks and snacks on the porch for delivery people. They always seem excited by it.",
                "Not weird, I've purposefully purchased extra food and called it a mistake to offer the driver something extra on top of the tip",
                "I would be so fucking happy if someone offered that to me.",
                "Definitely not insulting! That's very generous and thoughtful and I'd do the same thing \u2764\ufe0f",
                "In my opinion this is not about ego status or respect towards anybody.\n\nThe question is do we value food...\n\nIn the worst case he declines the offer so theres is no real downside for anybody.",
                "Please let a restaurant make this mistake on one of my orders! I'm tired of cooking. I would be ecstatic to get some nicely prepared meals I could reheat for a few days.",

She cut a big piece off and left it for them. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n\nThe more we extend community to others, the better off we will be. We share food and our love. When we\u2019re afraid, we close ourselves off to the potential of sharing and community connection. And become further divided. Food brings us together. \n\n\ud83d\udc9a",

                "Not true. At all. I gave my driver a tip and the free big mc I got. She was appreciative cause she said she didn't get a  chance to eat all day.",

And that driver did more for you then 60% of them out there would have.",
                "Nah, there were quite a few times I\u2019d doordash all night and still not have enough to buy dinner and everything else I was working/saving for, and gestures like this were the difference between getting dinner or not.

Best guess is that she was very food insecure, as she came severely underweight (4 lbs and preggo at 1.5 years old) and with injuries that were disabling and likely came from fighting for resources. \n\nShe\u2019s a monster when it comes to food. \n\nThe good news is this can be trained down a bit. And if your little pumpkin is showing signs of anxiety or distress in their need for food, or is causing havoc, you can train this to be manageable. \n\nYou can start small. I started with teaching her \u201ccome\u201d, \u201chigh five\u201d, and other tricks she naturally gravitated to, to get her used to training, clicker training, and the idea that FOOD is part of the magical experience. We then moved on to teaching sit, then teaching sit at meal time. She doesn\u2019t get her meal until she sits. Then sit and stay. She can\u2019t approach her bowl until we allow it. \n\nIt seems silly, but even the act of sitting can help lower their autonomic nervous system, easing the strain of heightened emotions. \n\nYou can continue to build on this, teaching them a special place to wait for meal times and so on. I\u2019d recommend you pick up the book Clicker Training for Cats for more. It\u2019s a wee tiny thing but can be a big help. \n\nAll of my cats come when called, so I\u2019m never late for the vet.

At least he sticks to cat food - his mother was even worse, and would tear open bags of bagels to munch on them.\n\nOne of the things I find funny is that Cinder will now sometimes politely request a refill on a semi-full food dish, presumably on Bo's behalf. I don't know if it's because she wants to make sure he's fed, or if she just wants him to stop annoying her by pouting about it. The only time she has boundaries with food is when the squeeze tube treats come out; if Bo tries to muscle in on her kitty gogurt time, he gets a very firm paw planted in the middle of his face until her turn is up.",

Even if there will be dessert *after* the meal, the food I save to eat last is the dessert *of the meal*.\n\nBut, this also has drawbacks. Growing up my father would walk by and just grab food off my plate. It was usually the food I was saving. Food insecurity even when I had plenty. Resentment runs deep and long. Never forgave him because he never accepted what he did was wrong.",

I have to spit in it so no one else will grab it, mix it all up into an easy to ladle mess, and then shovel it into my maw, one arm curled around the plate.  Growl at anyone who comes near.\n\n... oh, sorry, had a flashback.  That wasn't me, that was the football team at my dorm's dining room.",

Yes, we do, too.",

                "I usually save what I like best for last. I don't think that's a good way to do it bc it's led me to need to finish everything even if I'm full so I can have my fav part. It's hard to break that habit, but maybe if I ate what I liked best first, I could keep myself from overeating.",
                "I\u2019m not sure if this qualifies, but I eat my food in steps. All the veggies, all the starch, all the proteins. I also don\u2019t like it when wet stuff touches other food on the plate. As a kid I would get up and wash my plate if there was something that could touch another food item.

                "Depends on what it is. If it\u2019s something I ordered and everything in the meal is used with the same sauce I eat from best to worst so I can enjoy the good food with the sauce in case I run out. Mostly I try to eat evenly though.",

                "No, I eat the things that taste best hot first. Steak and salad? I'm eating the steak first, salad second. Obviously if I were to order at a restaurant they will handle the timing for me and I would eat the salad first. I could be more careful with my timing at home, but I don't think anyone realistically accommodates this unless they live on their own. I would be more then happy to make myself a salad and eat it in front of the grill waiting for the steak.",

I\u2019ve got no family left and no worldly possessions or experience or friends (as we married at 18 and he didn\u2019t allow me to have outside connections) I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do or where I\u2019ll go or do. I just needed to tell someone \u2014 I\u2019m gone. We\u2019re gone. No more [removed name] We are gone.\n\n\u2014 \n\nEdit: I never thought this would get traction. He didn\u2019t know I had Reddit as I would just brows and clear my cache/history, I made an account to post because I wanted someone anyone to know I\u2019m trying. I have no one and just want to pretend I had friends I could reach out to?\n\nTo those asking for \u201cproof\u201d of abuse. I\u2019m not uploading any images of myself. \n\nTo those saying you can\u2019t rent a uHaul at night. Yes, you can! It\u2019s called Truck Share 24/7, the location was walking distance from our house. I brought the dogs \u201cfor a walk\u201d if I got caught and with me if I didn\u2019t because I love them? Here is proof of the uHaul .. it wouldn\u2019t let me make it for 2/15 so I did 2/16 at 11:30pm and when I got there I chatted with them to claim I didn\u2019t know it booked the wrong day and the rep on the chat \u201cfixed it\u201d [https://imgur.com/a/WGmY3zd](https://imgur.com/a/WGmY3zd)\n\n\nTo those saying I shouldn\u2019t have had a kid with him?

I don\u2019t know I didn\u2019t think of that but he was mad she was a girl and has never done anything with her or held her played with her.

The first two times (let\u2019s call her Lexie) Lexie rang my fianc\u00e9 and said \u2018just bring some food for the BBQ\u2019. Ok cool I thought, bring some burgers, sausages nothing to fancy. So we turn up and Lexie & her family (x2 daughters & partner) are all there, BBQ fired up but nothing on it? So turns out I was the one supplying the food for everyone as they were hosting (I don\u2019t think this is normal, not from my upbringing anyway). I did have enough food to go around, wasn\u2019t a incredible BBQ though. \n\nSecond time, same conversation this time I took a little bit less as we only got back from lunch a couple hours prior to this event as it was slightly last minute. They all looked disappointed I hadn\u2019t taken as much food as previously, not really my problem and I only had one burger so they could have more food between them. \n\nHere\u2019s my biggest problem, last week the usual happens so we go to the BBQ, however, I refused to bring any food as I genuinely believe they should at least put out some crisps or something, I know they are hosting but surely this isn\u2019t normal. Upon them all discovery I didn\u2019t bring any food, the atmosphere changed and Lexie suggested \u2018we\u2019 go to the shop to pick some stuff up, I said \u2018no problem, I\u2019ll drive and come with you\u2019. We get the food, which she has picked out all the expensive meats, rolls, crisps etc, when we arrive at the till to buy the items she looks at me to pay? I refused, car journey back to their house was awkward and I left with my partner immediately. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 thinks I\u2019m right but also could of bitten the bullet and then just said we\u2019re busy for any future invites, I disagree and believe I did the right thing by informing them that this isn\u2019t normal cultural (for me anyway)\n\nAITA for how I acted?\n\n(London, UK) for context on the area",

Mom just picked a nice work dress, Dad had a suit, the food was a potluck provided by the riverboat crew. The captain married them. They told everyone afterwards. No invitations, no wedding dress, no fancy catering, zip. Just a boat and then some paperwork afterwards. I don't even think they told everyone until the honeymoon was over two weeks later.",

We kept it extremely simple.  Everyone had a good time.  And we are still just as married now - 36 years later.  \n\nSpend what you want to and make it what you want it to be.  When your best friend gets married - he can spend that on his own wedding if he thinks it is that important.",

If going to a simple ceremony to celebrate you and your SO's love for each other without booze, food and a band is so onerous to them, you wouldn't wish for them to have to suffer the imposition.\n\nI admit, it does make me wonder if your \"Best\" friend considers you as THEIR best friend. \n\nOne of my great aunts (Who lived well past 100) told me that a wedding is a religious service, and in many churches anyone may attend.  The reception is a private party, and anyone may be excluded and admission limited to invitees.\n\nIf you are having a civil ceremony, in the US, it's all basically contract law. the judge who marries you can have two of the court's clerks be witnesses, and slam-Bam you're married in the eyes of the law.",

Skimp on food, literally no one expects great food at a wedding, and hire an open bar with just cheap stuff at it. You could even stock the bar yourself and hire a local bartender to run it instead of hiring some kind of service.\n\nWhen I waited tables in college, plenty of the bartenders would work side gigs tending bar at weddings. Hit up your local liquor store for a few hundred bucks of typical liquor, wine, and beer and you can probably hire a bartender for a few hundred bucks for the whole night too.\n\nYou could even hire food trucks to cater the wedding for less than you\u2019d pay a traditional wedding catering service.\n\nAs soon as you put \u201cwedding\u201d before bar or catering, the price goes up.

I honestly couldn't tell you what I ate or drank at anyone's wedding. \n\nI recently got married and I had a simple buffet at a pub after the ceremony. Spent a little bit of money on a family meal of pies from our favourite pie shop in town and our lovely venue sorted a buffet for our evening guests. Our guests loved it.

I wouldn't even know where to get \u00a315k from. \n\nWhen I compare my wedding with someone who did spend \u00a315k - \u00a330k the difference was definitely the amount of people they've invited, the venue itself and also whether it was an open bar (which from my understanding depends very much on where you live.

I know people won't agree with me, but it's an honour to be invited to a wedding and you don't automatically get an invite because you are family or some kind of friend. I had so many people tell me that the wedding day was about other people. Nope. It's about you and your partner. My main aim was to ensure that there was food for the guests as there is nothing worse than being hungry and somewhere to purchase a range of drinks \ud83d\ude0a",

I\u2019m confused by the sorcery she did because I did mine the same month and our 10k budget quickly ballooned to 30k (in part because our guest list was much MUCH bigger than yours). For me the food budget was the killer because my husband has a food allergy and the cheap options wouldn\u2019t serve us.

Once we booked the catering we knew our budget was blown\n\nMy friend rented a beachfront AirBnB where the bridal party got to stay for free and get ready in, rented folding chairs that the groomsmen set up in the sand. Made her own floral arrangement (ended up spending double what she planned because the first round wilted in the fridge) and recruited her family to make all the food (all kind of picnic food like ambrosia salad, potato salad, burgers, etc). Borrowed a speaker from a friend and got help from family to set up a playlist and microphone (free).

To compromise we chose a nearby mid-range hotel and limited the invitation list to 100 guests for the sit down (which is considered a large wedding in my culture, but small in his - he comes from a v large family) and had a buffet in the evening, which is when we extended the list to the rest of our friends. We still came in around 11,000 GBP for the entire wedding (outfits etc), which was pretty good considering how much of that cost was for the sit down meal, wine and a very nice evening buffet. We did have a cash bar because that\u2019s normal in the UK. Plus I hand made a lot of things like the table decorations to keep my spending within my personal budget. I still wish we\u2019d not spent as much though as even though we\u2019re very happy I still believe the money could have been better spent elsewhere.\n\nI\u2019ve been to some very nice weddings where us guests have mucked in to provide food for the reception which have been great fun and the food delicious. Its a bit of a tradition in the community I grew up in and we had several amazing cooks who could rustle up a gourmet feast on the smallest of budgets. Have also been to a couple of posh weddings where the food has been expensive but \u2018meh!\u2019. \n\nI think the most important thing is that the couple are marrying for love and have a day they\u2019ll remember - which can still be done without spending silly money. If the couple are cash strapped I\u2019d rather they kept their money for a great life together. \n\nThe only time I think it\u2019s ok to drop huge sums on a wedding is if the person is loaded and happy to splurge so much on stuff like that.

                "For decades in the United States weddings were informal affairs. They were usually performed at weekly church services (not a special ceremony) or may even have taken place at community events such as harvest festivals (and often at barn raisings). In cities they were usually small ceremonies at a church with only a few family members in attendance. \n\nBut in 1840, in England, Queen Victoria married Prince Albert in a wildly lavish ceremony where she and her bridesmaids wore white dresses. That wedding was the genesis of what we know as the modern wedding. Starting after that wedding the wealthy in England started modeling their weddings after Queen Victoria's, and it wasn't long before that custom made its way across to the US. Following the Civil War weddings started to be more lavish affairs as commoners tried to have the \"royal wedding\" experience. \n\nThat continued until the 1920's when a marriage boom from soldiers returning from World War 1 kick started a wedding \"industry\" where venues, catering companies, and jewelers all tried to cash in on what an \"ideal' wedding should be. \n\nFollowing the great depression and World War 2, the idea of a \"fairy tale\" wedding had taken hold. Spurred on by fashion and wedding magazines at the time, the modern wedding as we know it, with a lavish ceremony, followed by a grand feast was solidified. It was mostly spurred on by shrewd companies who understood that people wanted to show off and create an opulent environment for their wedding, and now, the modern wedding industry makes over $50 BILLION dollars a year. \n\nThere is nothing wrong with a simple ceremony attended only by friends and then sharing a meal together. You are not royalty, where you are expected to give a lavish feast, and you are not a member of high society, where not doing so would be considered faux pa. You are a regular person, who can embrace a long forgotten tradition of a regular wedding. Have the ceremony you and your spouse want. That's all that matters.",

My immediate family was invited so it was 8 people total. Our photos turned out better than anyone's I've seen and we had a great time. It was a little planning beforehand but it was pretty stress free. We spent very little and had the entire day to fill out our itinerary. At the end of the dinner, the owner opened the bar area of the small restaurant and we were encouraged to invite all of our friends that lived nearby for a drink to celebrate. It was a blast. They showed up last minute and it turned into a moving reception as we moved to another bar, where we kept adding on people to the party. It was both classy and carefree.

            "title": "AITA For Not Cooking Vegan Food Or Ordering Any At A Housewarming Dinner?",
            "selftext": "Alright so, I\u2019m a 23 year old woman, I recently started living by myself and I decided to host a housewarming dinner/get together.\n\nThe invite list was fairly small, 5 family members and 3 friends. (My apartment is quite small so that was enough to be cramped lol). I called everybody before hand to make sure whatever I was cooking would adhere to dietary restrictions & allergies etc. A few people asked if they were welcome to bring other foods, wine, drinks etc and I said sure.\n\nSo it happened last night and I had basically cooked a scaled down thanksgiving meal, smallish turkey, chicken, potatoes, mac and cheese and salad. I was also expecting other people to bring stuff and almost everyone did, it turned into kind of a potluck situation. \n\nMy brother ended up coming a bit late which isn\u2019t too unusual, but he had a woman who he introduced as his girlfriend in tow. I didn\u2019t really have a problem with it. I was thinking it would\u2019ve been nice for him to tell me she was coming but from the way he explained it it was a last minute decision. \n\nWe\u2019re all standing around my tiny table praying & when we\u2019re done it\u2019s time for food. My brothers girlfriend asked what was vegan at the table and said she\u2019d been eyeing a few things. I said I personally hadn\u2019t cooked anything vegan, but one of my friends who is vegetarian had. It was some kind of stuffed peppers thing. \n\nI wasn\u2019t expecting to have a vegan so I wasn\u2019t prepared but his girlfriend seemed really upset. My brother pulled me aside about an hour after and said it wasn\u2019t really good hosting to only have 1 dish for her to eat. To be fair, she did look sort of left out just eating stuffed peppers and i did feel bad, but when my brother suggested I order her some food to make up for it I said no. \n\nVegan food is quite expensive where I live and I had already gone over my budget for the month with my dinner. I told him he was definitely welcome to order it, but I personally couldn\u2019t afford another $25-$30 on one meal for her. \n\nThere was no big scene or anything, he stayed until the end of the night and she stayed too, i told her she was welcome to raid the fridge because i was sure I had some foods suited to her but she didn\u2019t take me up on that offer. \n\nThis morning however, he called and said that I should\u2019ve at least ordered for her, considering I only had one dish she could eat, and that it was insulting to her being told she could go through the fridge \u201clike some rat or something.\u201d\n\nNow I\u2019m conflicted, last night I didn\u2019t feel that bad for not ordering but today I do based on what he said and how she felt. AITA?\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019m not too familiar with Reddit, so feel free to lmk if I haven\u2019t been clear or formatted this wrong. TIA.\n\n\n\nSo this part on is an edit:\n\nI read through most of the comments so far and I\u2019d like to clarify that his girlfriend didn\u2019t say anything mean or demanding to me, and I\u2019m fairly sure she never intended for me to hear the rat thing. She seemed like a sweet girl, just I guess she felt out of place. I appreciate the people giving fair comments but some of you are just being mean to her, which i ask you kindly not to do when giving your opinion. Thank you!",

Especially when in a holiday destination. You should ask the restaurant first though\n\n- no other food should be consumed on the property.",
                "It's rude.\n\nIt can cause a problem if someone else sees them eating and wants to order \"what they're having\" and gets told no.\n\nIn some places depending on your local health code it can be out right illegal. Your insurance might not like it as well.\n\nLocally the liquor license rules say if you have a license only liquor purchased on premises can be consumed. So restaurants without a license can be BYOB but if you have a license you cannot allow people to bring in bottles of wine for their meal even if you open the bottle for them.\n\nPersonally, towards the end of my time working in restaurants I was sous chef in a fine dining place with a pastry chef. People would show up with birthday cakes they wanted us to serve at the end of their meal all the time. We'd do it but charge them an enormous fee, much higher than we'd have charged them for the pastry chef simply baking them a cake, to do so and we told them so.",
                "It's very rude in the US. You shouldn't be taking up a table at a good place and only ordering for half the people there. The only exception I know of is when a restaurant doesn't have a liquor license, you can sometimes bring your own alcohol and even order mixers for it.",

The food was for the kids and the adults ordered pizza. \n\nNo one wanted to deal with them because they were Irish travellers. Didn't care they just looked like regular old white people to me. \n\nSo I took care of them. Got them their food, their drinks, checked on them, did the usual job. They paid, gave me what amounted to about a 75% tip (which in Ireland tipping isn't a thing so this was huge) they then left. \n\nTravellers have a bit of a reputation here in the same way gypsies might in other parts of Europe. Kind of a lingering fear you might be mugged mixed with some anger and loathing. \n\nMe being an immigrant to Ireland was just like \"uhh what?\" \n\nSuffice to say I never gave a shit if people brought in other food. I don't own the place, nor do I care if it \"looks tacky\" you wanna have mcdonalds fries with your brisket? You do you.",

They\u2019re certainly not chill with you flagrantly bringing outside candy Bc they sell it there. It\u2019s doubly so for a whole ass restaurant. \n\nIt\u2019s extremely rude. The exemptions for small children and people with food sensitivities are sensible and thoughtful, anyone not complying otherwise and getting irate about it is purely being an ass.",
                "It is common courtesy. Unfortunately, people don't think anymore. They treat outside dining  like it's a public park. Imagine if you brought your own coffee to Starbucks just to sit down and use the wifi. Shit wouldn't fly",
                "We will sometimes bring outside food for our picky child. This is only for him & only if we\u2019ve seen the menu before hand & there really is nothing he\u2019d eat there. If a restaurant does not let us (even though we\u2019d be purchasing their food) we will leave and said restaurant won\u2019t get our business. Simple as that.

Then it would generally be ok to eat a granola bar or something.",
                "I feel like that rule is stupid. A customer is a customer as long as they're purchasing something i wouldn't care.\n\nI've had a McDonald's bag in hand and sat my disabled partner at a table and gone to order from the establishment. I hadn't even spoken to someone just stood in the que and the owner comes out and says 'are you the one that sat down at my table' i said yes I've come to order and i was told 'i want you to leave I don't want your type here'\n\nSo what you're saying is you don't want any customers because i aint ever returning unless im burning the place down \ud83d\ude02 how dare he! I now make sure to tell everyone not to go there.\n\nOn another note I've seen this individual ask for people to work there CONSTANTLY \n\nObviously nobody wants to work for an asshole",

Stick by your guns and next time tell them they're welcome to eat elsewhere. You're not running a damn park where they can just bring their shit for a picnic.",

A drink, or a snack or something, who cares?\n\nFor example, I got some dirty looks for bringing a taco into the bowling alley I frequent one time. I was late, and had a bit of my meal from outside to finish. \n\nI spend enough money at the bar there every week, $15-$35, that hassling me over the $6 burger I could have bought at the alley would be sort of silly, should I turn out to be one of the easily offended types.",

Someone who isn't careful about cross contamination can also consider their typical \"clean\" spices to be contaminated if they know they use their fingers to grab spices and sprinkle it on food.\n\nUnfortunately making you plain unseasoned rice might be the safest bet. A typical kitchen can't guarantee no cross contamination of gluten. You can't have dairy so she can't use butter to flavour the rice grains. \n\nIf she's cooking meat for everyone, there's a chance the meat is seasoned with contaminated spices and sauces.\n\nI think it's risky to expect someone who isn't gluten free to cook a meal that is safely gluten free.

                "Seriously? If that's all yours does, you are lucky. \n\nNormal morning:\n\nWake up to cat, smacking me in the face, sometimes with her paw, sometimes with her tail. I look at my phone, it's 6:15. I have 15 minutes before the alarm and inform cat this news. \n\nI roll over.\n\n\"Meow\"? It's a softly spoken meow, but I know this can turn for the worst quickly. \n\n\"Meow....\" louder this time. She jumps off the bed but that can only mean trouble. I sit in silence waiting for the inevitable. A few moments later I hear it. \n\nShit starts falling off my dresser. \"Oh, was that me? I must have such a clumsy fluffy tail\" she doesn't say this because she's a cat, but this is what that final \"Meow\" means. \n\nI get up and go downstairs. The cat is somehow right in front of and behind each foot, simultaneously, as I go down each step. This can be deadly. \n\nI use the bathroom as the cat rubs against both feet, all the whole uttering cute \"meow\". Now, if you speak cat, you know this can be life threatening. If you don't, you are ill informed.\n\nI go to the kitchen and open canned cat food, which I'm doing entirely too slow, and she WILL write a scathing review about the service around here. This only takes a minute, but those meows are now at 9 decibel, each one more demanding. The tail begins to poof. I walk over to give her the dish, and she attempts one last trip maneuver which I successfully avoid. \n\nAnyway, I love this 15 year old toothless purr factory, and just felt like writing out what I perceive to be our morning monologue.",

            "selftext": "Just to start off, this is what I've been called by many people - a bad cat owner because they are on a dry food diet.\n\nTo give some context... I've raised a bunch of cats in my lifetime, I would never feed them dry food as I am aware of the disadvantages of dry food. So, my past cats would eat wet food only. All of them were healthy and died of old age.\n\nThis year, me and my partner adopted two kitty sisters - they were found on some construction site when they were about 4 months old, then took into a shelter and then to a temporary home before eventually ending up with us. When they were found, their intestines were wrecked by bugs and they were barely alive - it took a lot of work from the shelter and different vets to save them. So, long story short, it turned out that they simply do not digest wet food, whether it's treats or a meal - they end up with huge stomach ache, diarrhea, vomitting and end up having to take meds until they get better. Different brands (best ones available) and flavors have been tried, but it always ends the same.\n\nSince I've always been against dry food, it was hard for me to suddenly feed dry food to cats that I love dearly, but it was either this (dry food + plenty of water + supplementary treats to keep them healthy) or forcing them to eat wet food and then be in pain.\n\nThe shelter took them to many vets, so did their temporary owner, so did we - all vets say the same: inability to digest wet foods properly, senstive stomachs.\n\nSo, am I really a bad person for choosing dry food for them? I'm just trying to give them a good life :(",

In addition to that it\u2019s gentler on their stomach and digestive tract and is specially formulated food for that exact purpose. If you\u2019re stressed about water intake you can add a touch of water, if your cats drink water it\u2019s unnecessary.",
                "There's nothing wrong with feeding quality dry food or a mix of dry and wet food. Food quality and hydration are way more important than wet vs. dry, and a cat can be healthy eating either or both. My SIL's cat just died aged 21 after a lifetime of mixed food. No, it's not very close to what they would naturally eat. But I made blueberry pancakes for breakfast today, and that's not very close to what a human in the wild would naturally eat, either.\n\nYeah, wet food is usually better, but as you know well not in every case. You already know the answer to this question as a vet told you not to feed them wet. If you are concerned about their water intake and hydration, there are lots of supplements/toppers you can add to their dry food or even plain water.",
                "My cat doesnt like wet food. Am I suppose to feed her something she doesn't like?",
                "I\u2019ve had cats my entire life. I have always fed them dry food - always. I have always made sure they get nutritionally-sound food that is best for them according to my vet and backed by science.\n\nIn many cases when I was younger, it\u2019s what I could afford. I have always had very healthy cats who lived to be very old and died of old age. I only had one who died at a young age and that\u2019s because he had a genetic issue, nothing to do with food. (My cats aren\u2019t even crazy about wet food so they likely wouldn\u2019t even be happy - I struggle to get them to eat it when I\u2019m trying to use it as a treat lol)\n\nThey get wet food on occasion, when they need meds and I can\u2019t easily get them to take them any other way or as a treat. That said, I\u2019ve never had an issue with any of my cats being under-hydrated, which I know can be an issue for some. I have water in several different places in the house and a fountain. \n\nI\u2019ve never understood this all or nothing mindset. If your cats are healthy and your vet is telling you your cats are healthy, tell everyone giving you unwanted advice to sod off. It\u2019s really none of their business.",
                "Idk why people are against dry food. That\u2019s honestly the first time I\u2019ve heard this and I volunteer at a cat shelter, have fostered cats for 15 years and had my own cats since I was a child. Your cats will be fine and you are a good owner for feeding them a diet that\u2019s right for them!",
                "No you\u2019re not a bad cat owner for not feeding them something they can\u2019t digest???  Dry food isn\u2019t poison.  Whoever\u2019s bothering you about this needs to mind their own business.",

That is NOWHERE NEAR truthful.\n\nFeed your cat whatever the fuck they\u2019ll eat. As long as it\u2019s nutritionally sound (which dry food legally has to be), you\u2019re perfectly fine. \n\nYou should only consider changing your cats diet if it is harming them. If your cat is getting constant kidney stones from eating dry food, then switch it! But if they\u2019re not, and they\u2019re drinking fine, and their levels are fine, then you\u2019re doing fine",

Wet food can be helpful for cats, but it's not an absolute...cats lick their butts and poop in boxes, they're not the delicate flowers that some people make them out to be.\n\nI've raised many cats with care from many veterinarians in the various cities I've lived in across the U.S.. Not once has a vet demanded that I feed my cats wet food; just suggested it as an option (and I do on occasion).",
                "My cat had some health issues last year so he had to eat a very special dry food, the vet suggest giving him wet food once a week mostly for water intake and that made me feel very unsure mostly because my cat doesn't find joy drinking from his pots but after sometime I discovered he loved drinking from mine mugs so now he has 2 mugs that me and my gf pretend to drink from (If he knows it's from him it won't be touched) so if you're afraid that dry food won't give them the necessary liquid intake maybe find funky ways, my cat also loves drinking water from my small garden so I have a small decorative vase only for him. If the quality is good and the kittens are receiving love I bet they will be very happy!",
                "No. Kibble is not dangerous for cats; big brand kibbles are made in accordance to guidelines that were set partly by veterinary nutritionists.

                "As long as your cat is getting adequate nutrition, you're doing nothing wrong. It's my understanding that the main reason to give your cat wet food is to ensure that its staying hydrated. If you have good access to water for your cat, it's fine so long as they're drinking it. I have a bowl in the kitchen and one in a different room for my cats. I typically give wet food as a treat, but one of my cats doesn't like wet food/treats except for a few select things. The other one just licks the gravy off the \"cuts/bits\" of wet food. Even tuna. Anytime I'd give her wet food that isn't the pat\u00e9 kind, shed make a mess all over the floor. I thought she had issues eating it or something, but no. Turns out she's just licking the gravy off everything \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0fAll cats are different.

Had to switch to a wet food that had 0 carbs (extremely hard thing to find) to avoid giving insulin, her blood sugar was not high enough to give even the smallest dose without swinging too far in the other direction\n\n\nSo just think of it this way, just like with people a good diet keeps the vet away.",
                "Despite popular opinion, wet food is not better than dry food. The only difference is that wet food gives them more water in the food. This is easily made up for by them drinking water. \n\nSo you are not a bad owner for feeding your cats dry food.",

Diet is important, but there is a lot more to life and genetics will play a huge role at the end of the day regardless of what someone's diet is like.

Dry food is important in a cat's diet just as well because it helps with plaque build-up on their teeth, saving them (and you) from having to go through getting dentals done sometimes twice a year. Dry food is also much more cost-effective if you're feeding the proper amounts.\n\nThe main downside to feeding exclusively dry food is that it has more kcals per serving than wet food does, which (if not monitored properly) can cause cats who overeat to become fat, which in itself comes with other health issues such as limited mobility due to stress on their joints, leading to muscle wasting and arthritis, or even diabetes. \n\nTL;DR you are by no means a \"bad cat owner\" for feeding your babies a dry food diet, as long as they're getting their hydration and not putting on extra weight.

I'm really mystified by the idea of a cat whose stomach can tolerate dry food when it's moistened, but not wet food.  \n\nI have 3 suggestions.  \n1., try introducing the wet food gradually, just mixing in a little with the dry food, gradually increasing it, and see how much they can tolerate, because cats are very sensitive to changes in food, it usually shows up as diarrhea.  \n\n2., see if doctor Pierson's website gives you a way to post a question to her.  Ask your local rescue groups if they know of any other online vet that allows users to post questions. \n\n3., there are prescription canned foods which are labeled as being specifically for sensitive stomachs.  I would try those first.  I'm sure that Purina and/or Royal Canin have at least one such food.  I think there is at least a third major manufacturer of prescription Foods, but I can't remember the name right now.  \n\nAlso, the term \"prescription food\" is somewhat of a misnomer -- no law prevents a dealer of these foods from selling to you without a prescription, and you can find some sources which don't require a prescription. Chewy does require it, but for instance my vet has a clinic upstairs and a store downstairs which sells these foods, no questions asked.\n\nAlso, try adding Fortiflora, which is a probiotic powder.

Sure, there are (some theories on) what is \u201cideal\u201d for both species\u2026 like \u201cbreast is best\u201d for human infants\u2014but ultimately \u201cfed is best,\u201d because any infant getting enough calories and basic nutrition through formula will thrive over a baby that for any/ many reasons cannot receive breast milk consistently, and is denied baseline nutrition. \n\nAs a cat owner, I can acknowledge that a home-cooked meat diet and/or wet food diet might be what\u2019s best for my kitty on paper, but have to fundamentally adopt the \u201cfed is best\u201d attitude toward feeling her, since she vomits every single time she eats wet food. She\u2019s VERY good driven, and even with a lick mat, she scarfs her food down way too fast.\n\nI now shave wet food on the lick mat for occasional treats, in small amounts, while serving her dry food (and fresh water of course, always), as her main meals each day. She keeps that down, and I can feel daily sure that she\u2019s receiving most of the nutrition it has available\u2014whereas she loses all of the nutrition in wet food, unless I very much micro dose it.\n\nAll of that is to say: fed is best. Yes, there are reasons to believe that a home-cooked carnivore / wet-food only diet is \u201cbetter\u201d than dry kibble\u2014just like human breast milk is \u201cbetter\u201d than formula (possible immune system transference, etc.)\u2014but FED IS BEST. FED is ALWAYS better than starving. \n\nIt\u2019s worth researching your kibble brands and cat nutrition needs, so you can make the best choices to meet their needs within your budget. Some brands are way more nutritious and ethical than other brands. \n\nJust\u2014 do not look down on yourself for either needing or preferring dry kibble over wet food. Do your due diligence on brands/formulas, weigh them against your budget, and feed your babies as best as you can.",

If this is what the vet recommended and it works, leave it alone! Cats can totally have food allergies and food intolerances. I had one cat that vomited up every wet food she tried and got horrible diarrhea from it... Guess what? She ate hard food. I had a cat that had severe kidney disease who only got wet food with extra water added and had to drink damn spring water or he'd get huge kidney stones.\n\nI would suggest you invest in a cat fountain though to make sure they are drinking enough water.",

I put down the food, Sunnie comes running to see and she started eating.  I had to get another bowl.  Didn\u2019t ever go back to the bottle.  \n\nShe refused to eat wet. My other two do and she gets a tablespoon of it with brewers yeast or fortiflora when I can afford it, then she gets about half of it licking off the good stuff.   I too feel guilty.

She was the QUEEN of our household and I was lucky enough to have raised her from day 1. Guess what? She HATED wet food, to the point that she would stare at you and knock it over if her sister had it. I\u2019ll never forget, in her vet notes after dental surgery it said \u201cFluffernutter may return to eating her beloved dry food\u201d because it was known that she would rather hunger strike than eat ANY wet food, lol.\n\nDon\u2019t doubt yourself here \u2014 thank you for being a good human.",

                "You're definitely not a bad owner! I would say if you can at least make sure they will tolerate eating wet food, even if it's only one kind, just in case for some reason they have to go on a wet-only diet (like if a male cat gets urinary obstructions, or if you have a diabetic cat as wet food has less carbs, or even if your kitty gets fat \ud83d\ude02 since wet food has again less carbs and is more filling.) And of course make sure your cat actually drinks water. If they don't you can get them a cat fountain, my cats love theirs!\n\nAs long as your cat is happy and you're feeding a good brand, then you're not doing anything wrong! My girl likes both but my boy, bless him, will only lick the gravy out of one specific flavor of hills science diet chunky wet food. And even that sometimes he won't even touch it! I've given up and he only gets dry now. But at least it will be better for their teeth in the long run!",
                "My 6 year old cat was born with a chronic urinary tract disease and requires special vet-prescribed (and very expensive) dry food.  About twice a month I give him soft pate cat food mixed with about a tablespoon of water. (The vet recommended this for extra hydration.) On his last vet visit (6 months ago) I was told that his teeth were in excellent shape (have never had them cleaned) with no plaque buildup. Cats are fine on dry food only. The vet told me that sugar is added to most canned foods and can cause tooth decay.",
                "While wet food has perks, so does dry food. For example its more butrient dence. I have always fed a mix if foods to kwep my cats healthy and happy. And they are. My current boy for a shunned wet food (though now he loves it again) ao hw got more kibble.\n\nYou would be a bad owner for offer these cats wet food",
                "My cat won't eat wet food she only likes dry food and she's fine. So long as they drink plenty of water alongside it, i don't see the issue",
                "No, you are not a bad owner.  I also have kibble for my cats to eat. I do the open bowl with them. It is stocked 24/7/365.  Though we do give each of our three cats a sixth of a tin per day. They also have fresh water. \n\nIf they can not handle tinned cat food. Then it is best to only have dried.",
                "Just wanted to chime in here, when I was a kid the family cats were fed only dry food for their entire lives and lived to be 16 years old and were very happy cats. I recently got 2 new kittens and they also eat dry food with a teaspoon of wet food at breakfast and dinner and they're doing great. Don't feel bad about feeding dry food, there's nothing wrong with it as long as they have ready access to water (we got a cat fountain for our cats).",

His stool gets all watery with wet food. I know his tummy must hurt :( With my cat and my dog, I feed them what's best for them",
                "My two cats lived very long and happy lives eating mostly dry food. I figured out which food they liked, which did change over the years as their nutritional needs and their ability to taste changed. Senior kitties need food that is more flavorful and easier on the kidneys.\n\nI would give them wet food as a treat now and again like once or twice a week but they would generally lick the gravy and not even finish the wet food itself. They always had enough dry food on standby so they could eat when hungry. They never got overweight or underweight, except when they got like 17+ years old.\n\nThey never attacked food as if they were severely hungry and starving. They just had normal appetite and were happy.\n\nSo no, I don't think that dry food is a problem. Just make sure they eat and drink and that they are healthy and happy.",
                "My vet said dry foods for the most part (which is controlled by a food dispenser), with a spoonful of wet food once a day. Both of my cats just turned 1 recently so I'm in transition from their kitten food to Adult now. Eventually I want to get them on Hill Science. It's a bit more expensive though.\n\nAlways go by with what your vet says before listening to anyone on the net. Everyone has their own experiences.",
                "i\u2019ve tried wet food, my cat doesn\u2019t really like it. I\u2019ve even tried a different type of dry food and he refuses to eat it. \n\nhe\u2019s a picky little guy, but he\u2019s lived a healthy year so far.",
                "My kitty will only eat Hills Science Diet she hates wet food etc. so I just give her a good food she actually eats.",
                "My vet recommended dry food for both of my cats.",
                "I have spend hundreds if not thousands trying to get my former stray to eat wet food. The finest wet foods usually too- $3 and 4 a can. Untouched. Uneaten. I think she spent too much time as a stray eating whatever kibble was offered. Dry food is the only thing she will touch.",
                "When we fostered, our cat Phoenix would not eat hard food. She was starving. We figured \"Well when she gets hungry she'll eat\" but she never did. We ended up caving and giving her wet food because it was better than her not eating. And the only reason we didn't give her wet food is because her owner didn't like when she would throw up or have diarrhea after eating it. We learned that was happening because she couldn't eat chicken or fish. We got her on turkey and beef wet food and she was fine.\n\nOur current cats, Barley and Ian, were also dry food only and have feline leukemia. Barley only gets wet food when he's had dental work or if he's sick (he'll have diarrhea if it's more than a few bites). Ian gets a little can of pate a day because he's missing a lot of his teeth and hard food is difficult for him.\n\nAnd before all that, all of our cats were dry food only with wet food given at vet recommendation. There's nothing wrong with dry food in general. Certain brands are definitely worse for them because of the filler. If they're eating, they're healthy and you're not broke as hell, you're doing everything right. Idk why people think you need to feed your cat wet food or raw foods for them to be healthy. Even our FeLV+ cats are doing fine.",
                "I did so much research on kitty kibble that I can afford, and would be most beneficial to my cats. It's not wet food. In fact, wet food causes intense behavior issues with one of my cats.\n\nIt's not top of the line cat food but it's the best and most affordable I could find at Walmart. My cats are all healthy and have shiny thick coats. My mom's cat who's indoor/outdoor and has wet food once a day is skinny and her coat looks... Bad. It pains me to see her look like this because that's my childhood kitty, since my mom switched to giving her the food I give my cats she's gotten a little healthier looking. (It used to be meow mix and wet food).\n\nAny time my kitties eat meow mix 2/3 of them throw up, and my mom's cat used to have vomiting problems that have gone away on the food I use.\n\nI use wet food as like a monthly treat, otherwise my oldest kitty scratches and bites If she thinks she's going to get it, and then doesn't.",
                "My cat is 16 and has been mostly dry food his entire life. He strait up refused wet food or treats or anything at all except his dry food until he was 13 and developed a taste for wet food and one specific brand of treats. At around 10 years old he had his second tooth removal surgery leaving him with only 3 teeth and still would only eat dry food. I make sure his dry food is quality and pay attention to the ingredients and the pebbles are small enough he doesn\u2019t have to chew them. He gets his hydration by drinking water. He is healthy and going strong and he doesn\u2019t look or act like \u2018an old man cat\u2019 yet. Why are people so insistent they need to eat wet food?",

                "Dry food helps with teeth but wet food helps with hydration. If you\u2019re feeding a food that your vet says is working and keeping them healthy and at a healthy weight then you should be okay. I feed both. They should always have clean water to drink as well",

We had a dedicated muffins and cookies guy on the westbound side (me) and the donuts were all done at the eastbound Tim's. Every morning we would load up a van with muffins and cookies etc and drive over to exchange for donuts. We literally didn't have the fryers and equipment at the westbound Tim's to make donuts. Sometimes the service station down the 401 in Dutton would run out of donuts or one of their fryers would be down, and we would do an extra bake / fry and send them some product.  OPP officers on their night shift would bring us McDonald's from up the 401, at the time it was a big deal to us kids because we didn't have one in our small town.  The cops ate for free, except for bottled juices. They had to pay for those for some reason. They would always tip us like 5 or 10 bucks too.  Anyway it was a different time, the bakers took pride in their work and everything was baked from scratch. We got big bags of muffin mix or dough, but the bakers did the egg cracking and adding whatever ingredients were required. Nowadays the stuff comes frozen and they heat it up at the store.  Someone working there now can correct me if I'm wrong but there are no longer actual donut fryers at Tim's anymore.\n\nEdit: we also did full made to order breakfasts. Bacon, eggs, hashbrowns.

He has his own kitchen downstairs and that if he doesn't want me to eat his food he should keep it down there. He didn't agree and kept yelling. I told him that it was time for him to move out. Four years of living in my house rent free as an employed adult was enough and that it was time to go. \n\nHe shut up, took his pizza, and went downstairs. When his mom got home she was pissed off at me. He works hard for his money and when he buys himself a treat I shouldn't help myself to some of it. I've pretty much had it with her too. I told her that she had to start paying for his food and utilities since she was the one who thought he should not pay anything to live here. \n\nShe works part time at her parents company and uses the money for herself. I am the primary earner. I pay for literally everything. Except her little luxuries. She pays for that stuff herself. \n\nShe said that she would not.

Talk to your fucking wife my guy. Tell her that you feel that her constant enabling of your son is stagnating his growth. Tell your son that you have given him 4 years rent free without any repercussions and that you can't do that any more. Set a fucking boundary. Make him sign a lease for gods sake.

He has everything down there. My wife won't let me charge him rent because he is saving up to buy a house. Sure he is. He has a new car, a new motorcycle, and a gaming computer that is probably worth about $5,000. \n\nI came home the other day and there was a pizza on the counter. My wife wasn't home so I had been planning on just having a soup and sandwich for supper but I was happy that she had gotten me a pizza. I grabbed a couple of slices and sat down to watch tv.\n\nMy son came up, saw me eating pizza and started yelling at me for eating food he paid for himself. This is rich. He usually eats with us every day and eats food that I pay for. \n\nI told him that it was on my counter in my house and that made it food for me. He has his own kitchen downstairs and that if he doesn't want me to eat his food he should keep it down there. He didn't agree and kept yelling. I told him that it was time for him to move out. Four years of living in my house rent free as an employed adult was enough and that it was time to go. \n\nHe shut up, took his pizza, and went downstairs. When his mom got home she was pissed off at me. He works hard for his money and when he buys himself a treat I shouldn't help myself to some of it. I've pretty much had it with her too. I told her that she had to start paying for his food and utilities since she was the one who thought he should not pay anything to live here. \n\nShe works part time at her parents company and uses the money for herself. I am the primary earner. I pay for literally everything. Except her little luxuries. She pays for that stuff herself. \n\nShe said that she would not. I said that I was cutting the household budget by one third. Her and her son were responsible for that part from now on. \n\nThey are both mad at me for starting this fight over some pizza.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*",

He could share, he's being a weiner. \n\nBut, when I was living with my parents, if I bought myself a small pizza, or some takeout, or just a buttload of McDonald's, or whatever, you get the idea, and I was thinking \"hell yeah I am going to town on all this trash food tonight!\" and I'm looking forward to having myself a big grease dinner, I would also be pretty mad if I set it down to take care of something, and then came back to my dad halfway through it without asking.

I'm assuming you've had conversations in the past about finances. I'm assuming there is some reason your wife only works part time (she probably was the primary care giver for your son, I'm guessing?).

It also sounds like you should be able to eat pizza your son buys, and it's fine if you and your wife decide together to kick him out. \n\nBut it also sounds like you think of yourself as a tiny dictator running your little home, and since you make the money, everyone (including your wife) has to bow to your wishes.

The plethora of food additives & preservatives (especially in processed foods, but they even put wax on apples and dye in salmon), household products/cleaners, industrial waste, chemical exposures in \u201csafe\u201d products (eg PFOAs), and of course the pharmaceutical revolution that has now altered our drinking water supply/system (eg estrogen levels from widespread use of birth control). \n\n\nThe vast majority of these chemicals are perfectly safe but if even 0.01% end up having unknown deleterious longterm consequences that\u2019s enough to make big problems due to the sheer volume of different compounds being used across so many industries. \n\n\nAgain this is purely speculative, but it makes sense to add [early onset] balding to the list of conditions that are having an increased presence in western populations. Interestingly, these conditions often have a lot to do with hormanal/autoregulatory systems (eg allergies and asthma), neurodevelopment (eg ADHD), and genetics/epigenetics (eg autism) which are areas of physiology where a single compound/change can have far-reaching implications (snowball on top the hill, butterfly effect, domino effect, etc).\n\n\nCheers",

Over a decade later, all the information I\u2019ve accumulated points to some interesting patterns.\n\nThe DHT hypothesis is just a hypothesis. It\u2019s speculative. It doesn\u2019t take into account that men age, DHT declines, but they\u2019re more likely to go bald. Why?\n\nThere\u2019s an obesity epidemic. Enough said there. For one, we don\u2019t eat nearly the amount of nutrient dense foods our grandparents ate, who might\u2019ve lived a much more active rural life full of organ meats, stews and fresh food in general. Our food is killing us and we export garbage to the rest of the world where it could manifest even worse for their lack of western stress management. The rapid westernization of food is sending people to the grave in countries where high caloric processed foods were never the norm. Robert Sapolsky writes about this in his biology essays, namely his collection The Trouble With Testosterone.\n\nGenetics. People abuse this word across the medical spectrum of disease and discomfort. It\u2019s a very convenient way to stop a conversation that wants accountability and investigation into an issue. Genes can be carried, but they\u2019re not always expressed. All of a sudden we have a massive pool of expressed balding genes in a generation or two. How does this happen? If it is generic, we can inquire and ask *well what in the environment is causing these genes to express themselves*? I for one started balding in my early 20s. My father balded in his 40s. Grandfather on both sides had full head of hair, all uncles have full head of hair. I am the only one who balded and the only one of my generation who lives in the US. Everyone else grew up rural Caribbean. I had chronically low T and DHT, thyroid was sluggish, metabolism was awful all due to stress. \n\nAll of this is evident in routine blood labs. The normal range is always moving in favor of insurances and overworked professionals that can\u2019t handle one more patient. Cancer is skyrocketing across the board as well as every single *preventable* disease there is. Cortisol is through the roof on everyone.\n\nBalding is an expression of the hazardous environment we live in. Full stop.",

Before I got pregnant I used to do all of the cooking and cleaning as I\u2019m a stay at home wife and my husband works full time. but now that I\u2019m 7 months pregnant I don\u2019t have the energy to cook or clean anymore so now it falls on my husband to have dinner ready and everything kept neat and tidy. He\u2019s never complained once and he actually seems happy to be doing chores and cooking for me or anything else I tell him to do. He really fell in love with cooking though and he tells me he wants to be a chef now. He\u2019s constantly showing me new recipes he wants to try and make for me and he\u2019s always jamming out to music in the kitchen while he cooks. Here\u2019s where the issue comes in. My husband has never been the best cook. He\u2019s not bad at all and he\u2019s made some amazing dishes.  He\u2019s just clearly not up to my level and it shows. Last night he made me \u201cJerk chicken\u201d with Jamaican rice from this recipe he\u2019s been talking about making for the past week. He\u2019s been really excited to try and and make it and I was really excited to try it since I\u2019ve never had it. Once dinner was ready he called me to the kitchen and the food looked and smelled amazing only thing was it didn\u2019t taste amazing again my husband isn\u2019t a bad cook but the chicken was so bland and it tasted like cinnamon. Needless to say I was pretty disappointed in him and asked my husband if he could just go pick up a pizza or something. He seemed sad I didn\u2019t like the food and asked if I thought he was a bad cook. I told him honestly \u201cyou\u2019re not terrible but I could\u2019ve made it better\u201d I thought by telling him Atleast he\u2019s not a terrible cook he\u2019d be happy with that. But he just got up without saying anything and left to get the pizza. After he got back he handed me the box of pizza and left upstairs to go to sleep. He\u2019s been acting cold and stoic with me ever since last night. AITA here?",

(TSN) on Monday reported a loss of $417 million in its fiscal third quarter. (AP Photo/Toby Talbot, File)\n\nBy\u00a0MICHELLE CHAPMAN\n\nUpdated 9:19 AM EDT, August 7, 2023\n\nShare\n\nTyson Foods Inc. is closing four chicken processing plants as it looks to lower costs.\n\nThe company said Monday that the plants being closed are located in North Little Rock, Arkansas; Corydon, Indiana; Dexter, Missouri and Noel, Missouri.\n\nTyson said that it will shift production to other facilities and halt operations at the four plants in the first two quarters of fiscal 2024. The company currently estimates having $300 million to $400 million in total charges, based on a preliminary analysis.\n\nTyson launched a plan in fiscal 2022 where it targeted $1 billion in productivity savings by the end of fiscal 2024. The company said that it realized more than $700 million of savings in fiscal 2022, which partially offset the impacts of inflationary market conditions. Tyson topped its $1 billion target in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, more than a year ahead of its plan.\n\nIn May\u00a0Tyson\u00a0posted a surprise loss in its second quarter and cut its sales forecast due to the cost of plant closures and layoffs.\n\nTyson has been trying to cut costs over the past several months. It\u00a0closed its corporate offices\u00a0in Chicago and South Dakota late last year and consolidated its workforce in Arkansas. In March it announced the\u00a0closure of two plants\u00a0in Arkansas and Virginia in order to better use available capacity at other facilities.\n\nTyson laid off 15% of its senior leadership and 10% of its corporate workers in April as it faces steep inflation on labor, grain and other inputs.\n\nThe company also reported its fiscal third-quarter financial results on Monday. Tyson posted a loss of $417 million, or $1.18 per share, for the period ended July 1. A year earlier it earned $750 million, or $2.07 per share.\n\nThe current quarter included a goodwill impairment charge of $448 million.\n\nRemoving asset impairment charges and restructuring costs, the Springdale, Arkansas-based company earned 15 cents per share. That\u2019s well below the 34 cents per share analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research expected.\n\nRevenue totaled $13.14 billion, down from $13.5 billion a year ago.\n\nTyson still anticipates fiscal 2023 revenue in a range of $53 billion to $54 billion. Analysts surveyed by FactSet expect revenue of $53.74 billion.\n\nShares dropped 8% before the market open.\n\n\ufffc\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.

Then one day, I made myself a huge sandwich with my favourite type of bun at the time, my fave deli meat and really good cheese. Sat down to eat it, the cat came to stare at me and whine for my food and I ignored her. She left almost immediately, which was weird, because I ate most of my meals with her staring at me and meowing like her foodbowl easn't full and literally half a metre away from her. \n\nSo I managed to take maybe two bites when I heard weird noises from the bedroom. I go to check and she has vomited all over the side of bed, in-between the sheets, the mattress topper, between the mattress and the bed frame, it went through the bedframe into the drawers underneath the bed and over clean bedding stored there. \n\nThis cat was a serial vomiter, so I knew by then this wasn't a health emergency. I scream my head off, shoo her away and start cleaning. Five minutes in, the first load of dirty bedding has been hauled off to the washer and I'm literally up to my elbows in cat vomit, when I hear something clatter in the kitchen. I run to the kitchen and the little criminal has apparently dragged my sandwich to the floor and is taking dainty little bites of deli meat from the side of the sandwich.\n\nLong story short, I screamed my head off for a second time so she dropped my sandwich, washed my hands so I could pick it up and put it somewhere cat-safe. Then I finished cleaning up in the bedroom and after that, I sat down and ate every bite of that bloody sandwich while staring at the cat. I know it's impossible, but to this day I can't help but be convinced that she vomited on purpose in order to get me away from my food.",

                "I understand your frustration, as I am dealing with the same.\n\nHowever, you might want to temper your anger with some facts going on.\n\n**Home Insurance**  \nWages and material costs have gone up. Remember when lumber was several times pre-pandemic prices? Well, it has come down, but the cost of labor remains. And most obviously, insurance claims from natural disasters has been much more and much more costly. There are already insurance companies that have pulled out of California and Florida due to wildfires in hurricanes (both accelerated by climate change) respectively. Because re-insurers (financial giants who insure insurance companies in case of overwhelming catastrophes) are raising rates on the insurance companies, or refusing to insure them altogether. You can bet that insurance in Maui, Hawaii is going to be even more expensive.\n\n**Auto Insurance**  \nAs you know, prices of used and new cars have surged. That means insurance costs more. Supply chain delays and shortages, chip shortages, COVID lockdowns in China covering entire regions even til June of this year, floods, heat waves, fuel costs for manufacturing and transport, etc. also affects auto insurance costs. Natural disasters have intensified, so we also have more frequency and more intensity in claims, too.\n\nCar thefts have risen, road rage has risen, carjackings, etc. (The police and criminal justice system are overwhelmed.)\n\nSo of course since auto insurance deals with insurance and replacement costs, and those costs had gone up. You essentially still have to pay more even when profit motive is removed.\n\n**Food Prces**  \nThere are two major factors affecting food prices.\n\nFirst, the **war** in Ukraine has led to sanctions on Russia and Belarus, and production and transport issues on Ukraine. This has affected fertilizer supply and prices. Remember when articles were being written about natural gas being scarcer and much more expensive? Ammonia nitrogen fertilizer is made from natural gas, and Russia was a huge supplier.  Russia, Belarus and Ukraine together are responsible for a significant portion of the three main fertilizers used in industrial agriculture: nitrogen, phosphates, and potassium. That is why prices of fertilizer surged as high as 400% last spring. Prices have come down somewhat, but they are still much higher than before the pandemic. As a result of higher fertilizer prices, farmers used less and planted less.\n\nPrior to war, Russia and Ukraine were major exporters of wheat and other grains. Ukraine was the largest sunflower seed and oil exporter, which is used in many products, including cooking oil.\n\nRussia just ended an agreement to allow Ukrainian grain transport vessels leaving Black Sea ports to be inspected and allowed through to the global markets.\n\nSecond, let\u2019s look at **climate change**. Massive heat waves, floods, unseasonable rains, etc. meant the agricultural regions worldwide are seeing major loses on top of less fertilizer use. We\u2019re talking 20% to 50% losses.\n\nEngland forecasted some 50% loss in their potato crop. Georgia patches saw a wam winter, so some 90% of peaches there were known to be gone by this spring. Parts of South America, Europe, India, China, etc. suffered production losses. China\u2019s and India\u2019s recent hear waves in the north severely affected their wheat crops, Pakistan\u2019s flooding of almost a third of their country wiped out crops. China\u2019s recent and current flooding is probably going to drop their rice production by 20%.\n\nNow think about these higher prices and shortages. So this means 8 billion people and their billions of livestock and hundreds of millions of pets (like dogs and cats) and their breweries and distilleries are competing for less grain and foods. With less wheat on the market, prices surge and buyers look for other starch alternatives, which also surge those prices. This has an effect on poor people in exporting counties who see their basic food and meat (livestock eat grains) prices rise, and so governments put in export restrictions to avoid civil unrest and discontent. Hungary restricted wheat exports last year to keep bread prices affordable for their people. India, the world\u2019s largest rice exporter, just banned all exports of rice except the expensive basmati rice, so their people don\u2019t have to compete with the rest of the world for exports. This will harm African countries that are primarily importers.\n\nIn the past 15 years, Russia has restricted barley exports, Thailand has restricted rice exports. I expect history is going to rhyme, especially with massive production losses due to climate change. The U.S. is unlikely to restrict exports. We have seen alfalfa hay grown in Arizona and sent to Saudi Arabia to feed their dairy cattle, when it would make more sense to ship dried powered milk or even Tetrapak\u2019d whole milk to Saudi Arabia from cows grazed on Wisconsin farms where rains help grow grass easily. We have seen how our gasoline and diesel and natural gas prices went up last year due to the U.S. continuing to export these fuels, which means we in the U.S. get to compete against buyers in other countries willing to pay more. So I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we continue to export grains and beef and chicken and like to the world, meaning we compete with them for food.\n\nBottom line, with continual climate change devastation, expect food prices to keep rising. We will be luckier than most because we don\u2019t spend as much on food as people in countries where food costs 50% or more of their meager income. I expect hundreds of millions to die in this coming decade.\n\nAfter reading all this, I hope you can see that these things you mentioned do have a greed component. But a great deal of this is actual **costs**.\n\nAnd unfortunately, climate change cannot be solved. Neither is the ecological collapse and Sixth Mass Extinction we have started. Nor the plastic and chemical pollution, nor the resource scarcity conflicts and wars that will occur when aquifers are pumped dry, rivers run dry, etc. affecting agricultural and manufacturing output and supply chains in the future. Did I mention there are also economic collapses going on in Lebanon, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, etc.?\n\nAll the population growth, all the destruction of biomes that support life, all the pollution, all the climate change consequences, etc. - all this is a centuries- to thousands-of-years-long predicament and bottleneck that we as a species will have to try to mitigate and hope to survive.",

He's got a pretty good arm too, for a baby. \n\nAbout a week ago he was eating blueberries and cut up pieces of strawberry and watermelon and he kept throwing them at me. Finally I got fed up and tossed a blueberry back at him. It bounced off his chest, he looked down at it, then back up at me, and broke into the hardest laugh I've ever heard come out of him. \n\nI threw a few more pieces of fruit and he was cracking up, but then he reached into his high chair and ate a whole handful of it. Normally he would just eat one bite at a time. This went on and on until he had eaten everything that didn't fall on the floor.\n\nWe've been keeping this up for the past week. Sometimes I try to throw the food right into his mouth but so far I've missed every time. \n\nI'll be honest though, I'm a little worried about tomorrow, because it's spaghetti night.\n\n\nEdit: Wow I'm surprised this got so much attention! I'm tossing breakfast at him now (eggs, fruit and toast), but I will post an update after spaghetti time. I don't feel comfortable putting a picture of him on the internet so you'll just have to use your imaginations.\n\nEdit 2: some people are worried he might choke if I throw food in his mouth. I'm a really bad shot lol, but I also had to learn baby heimlich and cpr because his older sister had (has) such a sensitive gag reflex and choked on food constantly. Like her gag reflex is so bad she has to have a warning on her chart when she goes to the dentist because she will throw up or gag if you touch the back of her mouth. When he started eating solid food i didn't want to take any chances so I also bought a thing called a LifeVac that apparently sucks objects out of a baby's throat if they're choking. I've never had to use it but it's right next to his highchair just in case! I appreciate all the concern for my baby though thank you for looking out for him!",

                "Some commenters are missing the point, the man's autism diagnosis may have been mild or extremely debilitating to his day to day life, the dog food could have come in tins, from a foodbank, or from butchers scraps but the point is those who do have debilitating conditions such as learning or developmental difficulties (whether or not this man's diagnosis was severe enough to be this), are being failed by a social security system that is not designed to help those who are extremely vulnerable or challenged to be able to access the support they need and are being left outside the sytem, when it isn't thier fault. This shows a system which isn't equipped to deal with individuals who are quite vulnerable due to mental impairments from getting the support required to live a relatively normal life.\n\nNitpicking the article and choices within from a position where you can make logical and rational decisions, when you presumably do not suffer from a condition that would impair with these, is a moot and quite frankly callous point that does not deter or detract from the original argument that those who do suffer from such impairments are being failed by a system which seemingly is not designed to help those vulnerable for which it should be for.",

They are set up in such a way so that when you recover from your disability, the benefit is stopped to reflect your new status. The myth I'd like to address is that it's possible to 'get better' from autism. It happened to me, but the last I checked, I'm still autistic. Even psychologists have told me it's life long. Birth to death. Still no PIP since 2017, though. Maybe I died and haven't caught up. I do tend to miss things. It would suit me so well to be too busy playing Terraria to notice my own funeral.",

                "Having read the article, it seems like the man turned to East Riding Council when his benefits stopped for some form of short term financial assistance, such as a Crisis Payment, but they turned him down because they claim he was receiving PIP which the council decision makers classed as income. \n\nWhat the article doesn't say is what benefits the man was claiming or why they had stopped. If the man was on benefits and his benefits had stopped then he wouldn't be a pensioner, because a pensioner implies someone who's old and in receipt of a state pension. Unless 'pensioner' here means old person, in which case we don't know what benefits he was claiming and why those benefits had stopped.\n\nThis doesn't make any sense because PIP is not means tested.\n\nMy guess is that the man was turned down because he either had his benefits stopped or he was being sanctioned by the Job Centre. Lots of local councils won't give anyone any crisis support or payments if they've had their benefits stopped or they've been sanctioned. \n\nThis could be for a number of reasons. He might have missed an appointment. He might have been late for an appointment. He might not have done a sufficient amount of jobseeking activity. He might not have applied for a sufficient number of jobs. He might have missed a meeting on a course. He might have refused to go on a course. He might have been told to apply for a job but failed to make the application. He might have missed a letter. He might have failed to record something in an online journal perhaps because he couldn't access the internet. \n\nI could go on. My point here is that the DWP can stop your benefits or sanction you for a wide variety of reasons and if they do there's nothing you can do about it. That is outside of a mandatory reconsideration and an appeal. \n\nIt is fundamentally stupid to withhold emergency short term financial support and assistance from people who have benefits issues. The DWP conditionality and sanctions model is arbitrary and cruel. It's not like this older man who has autism is that employable in today's employment market. \n\nThis is just another example of someone falling through the cracks and people following mindless rules and not really giving a shit.",

They redid their kitchen two years ago and got rid of the bread oven, but I still reflexively try to put bread where the oven used to be while putting away groceries in their kitchen. I asked my dad why his mom used to do it, and he said that she didn't have space in her kitchen, and that when they got rid of their own bread oven they got bread boxes to keep bread in.

For example, when they know they only need a small amount of X, but someone wants to take it home so they make double instead. Now that person knows they\u2019ll still be a bunch left and can take it home for free, which is essentially stealing but in a more stealthy way. So to stop this from happening, no one can take anything as a precautionary measure. It\u2019s also the reason why things that are made incorrectly and sent back often get tossed instead of being given to staff, as then someone might know this and purposely make a dish wrong so they can eat it later.

They cannot accept food blindly, without being able to guarantee its safety.  Just you, restaurant person saying that it's good, is not good enough.  \n\nIt's one thing to be able to offer canned goods, or even contained fruit (fruit with skin on) that is a guarantee of safety of sorts, as there is an expiration date on canned goods, and it's obvious when fruit is bad or not.\n\nSo say you throw away a couple pounds of cooked ground beef at the end of the day, from your restaurant.  Surely a shelf or food bank, or food for the masses, would be able to use that, right?  \n\nHow will you transport that product to the shelf safely?  Will you be able to maintain proper temps and protocol for handling that food, to get it to the location safely?\n\nAnd what if the place you want to bring it to, doesn't have holding facilities?  Here, take this free food.  But we don't have any way to store it safely.  It will be bad in the morning, so keep it, because then we'll have to dispose of it safely, and be responsible for it, and we cannot afford to pay someone, to dispose of something, that we cannot even store ourselves.\n\nIt killed me for a while inside too, when I had to dump food, but the truth is, without a guarantee of safety and safety protocol, they can't accept the food.  \n\nIf they serve food that you brought from the restaurant, and it went bad, they are on the hook, for that person becoming ill or dying.  It's not something, an organization wants to fuck with, and possibly lose funding, if provided at the state level.  \n\nWhat's the solution?  I don't know.  More funding of shelves and services, to be able to temporarily store food that will go bad in a while?  Or better funding so that the service can provide fresh meals?

Most of the time, they'll just give me some extra hot sauce, which is passable, but sometimes they'll feed me the secret nuclear ordinance they keep under the counter. Indian restaurants in particular are godlike, and they're the primary reason I do this. If I'm timid, they'll treat me like every other American, but if I go in with even a mild amount of bravado, they'll paint the walls with my viscera.\n\nAll this said, I'm acutely aware of how quickly conversations about my tolerance can get annoying.

            "title": "absolute idiocy at the food court yesterday",
            "selftext": "I have generally had a very positive experience with the self-service kiosks at the food court. If the Costco I'm at has them as an option, I always default to the self-service because I have found it to be faster.  \n\nYesterday, however, was just so mind-bogglingly stupid I am posting this hoping someone in management sees this and addresses this moving forward.  \n\nI get there at like 4:30, hardly peak meal time so I figured I'd grab a quick hot dog and soda before getting my shopping done.  I order and pay at the kiosk and go wait by the window for my order.  It appears the food court is short staffed since there's only two employees fulfilling orders.  No big deal, it happens, whatever.  The horror show that proceeded to play out was like watching a slow motion train crash.\n\nEmployee #1 decides her only job, despite the mounting crowds waiting around the windows, was to park herself by the pizza oven watching the pizzas slowly inch their way out of the oven.  \n\nEmployee #2 now appears to be tasked with fulfilling all the kiosk orders and manning the one manned order window.  \n\nAs I'm standing there watching, the kiosk tickets printer keeps churning out tickets and no one appears to be even looking at them.  Employee #2 handles two window orders before finally addressing the ticker tape of kiosk orders.  He spends what feels like an eternity lining up the orders.  At this point, I'm thinking at least he's trying to figure out the most efficient way of fulfilling these orders, i.e. batch process items to knock out multiple orders at once.  \n\nTo my horror, that was not the case, he was simply lining them sequentially, to process them in order, one at a time.  He handles about two kiosk orders when a pepperoni slice order appears to be next and since they're waiting for the pizza in the oven, he just goes back to taking orders at the manual window.  At this point, I realize I should have lined up at the manual order window since my ticket number was still about a dozen tickets away and this guy is working his way thru the manual order window (order, payment, gloves, food, rinse repeat) much faster than the kiosk tickets.\n\nThis entire time, employee #1 just stands there waiting for pizzas, boxing a couple of them for whole pizza order and slicing the others for individual slices.  \n\nEmployee #2 ends up absolutely swamped yet hopelessly working one order at time while also prioritizing the manual order window even though the kiosk orders have been waiting so much longer.  \n\nA hot dog and a drink ends up taking almost 30 minutes to fulfill.  I felt bad for employee #2 but then he was so inefficiently handling it that I ended up more mad at his stupidity than anything else.  My ticket # is like 178 and of course, he processes ticket 177 and decides to go back taking and fulfilling manual orders.  Some guy walks up to the manual order counter and orders a dog and drink and gets his order in 2 minutes while I've been standing there for thirty minutes with the same order with nothing to show for it.  \n\nA couple of suggestions: 1) if you're short-staffed, close the manual order window and make everyone order at the kiosks.  This way at least you're not constantly changing gloves, handling cash/payments etc.  2) If you have a 15 tickets and 6 of them are just for a hot dog and a drink, you can make like 12 dogs really quickly and then knock those out instead of making everyone wait around like jackasses while you make smoothies and plate pizzas.    \n\n&#x200B;",

They turn up for their assigned shifts care factor zero \n\nLow quality employees. I don't mean to be offensive, but I've made the same observations of counter staff. Surrounded by tickets, taking one at a time, putting a new pair of gloves on and off to make one hotdog, look at the next ticket, put new gloves on and make another hotdog, throw gloves away.  Look at next ticket, new pair of gloves and one more hotdog.\n\nI saw a worker look at my ticket and didn't read it was 2 hotdogs not one.  Same process, go back again, new gloves etc etc \n\nIt's a Poor system.  The same counter staff are then gong and assembling the food. The rostering and assigned stations are inefficient.\n\nI won't use Foodcourt anymore. I worry the same but giving a shit carries over into food preparation and handling.",

I saw this happen at a Subway, where there was only one person having to do everything. I understand why they wanted to batch, because they didn't want to have to keep taking the gloves off to take payments and then put them back on to do another order, but the one who got there first was having to wait for the associate to take care of everybody else's order at once. It would have gotten really ugly if their coworker hadn't finally arrived. And as for your experience, I'm sure it was maddening.

This includes recipes that normally would not be as sweet if it were made in the traditional way.",
                "Sugar/HFCS/processed foods might be reasons why you don\u2019t feel satisfied, but that doesn\u2019t really cut to the fundamental issue. These things aren\u2019t inherently bad for you; In fact, sugar consumption has been on the decline in the US for years yet the obesity rate continues to climb. \n\n\nThe fundamental reasons are satiety and palatability. Satiety comes from fiber and protein, two things that most pre-packaged and fast American foods lack. Most pre-packaged foods have little to no dietary fiber and little protein. Palatable foods are foods that are literally extremely tasty. Essentially, the average American diet is made up of foods that are extremely palatable, extremely calorie dense, and not at all filling. This makes it easy to overeat since your body\u2019s hunger signals (namely the hormones leptin and ghrelin) don\u2019t know if you\u2019re full or not.\n\n\nIf you buy foods that are high in dietary fiber and protein, and don\u2019t have a high amount of added sugar (generally one of the easiest ways that calories are added to foods; nutrition labels will display the amount of added sugar) or dietary fat (generally in the form of oils) then you can certainly eat American food without gaining weight. If you must eat pre-packaged food, make sure to measure it and only eat what can reasonably fit into your RDA of calories.",
                "I am not super familiar with the science, but the likelihood is that food in the US is indeed less satisfying, and sugar/fat content may be related to why.\n\nFor example, if I cook all my meals at home for a week, even if I am eating in a deficit, I usually feel satisfied and content, and hungry at normal hours. If I eat McDonald\u2019s on one night of the week, it is easily 400-600 more calories in a meal than I would normally eat - and I almost always experience hunger within a couple hours, and desperately crave fast food again the next day. I often even will finish eating it and think \u201cI should\u2019ve gotten more.\u201d\n\nOur food is literally scientifically addictive, and the worse it is for you, the more addictive.",

It's not impossible to choose healthy satiating meals here, just maybe takes a little more effort.",
                "The US is lacking in walkable cities. Europeans walk and get significantly more movement in their daily lives. It\u2019s very hard to keep weight off when you sit all day at work, spend 1-2 commuting, and every errand you have to drive rather than to. \n\nI also feel like we have this vast variety of food available at many price points so it\u2019s harder to make good choices. I was heavy in my 20s when I ate in restaurants a lot and ate meals my mother cooked. I cook most of my own meals now and am very particular about the kinds of restaurants I choose so it\u2019s a lot easier.",
                "Theres a lot of comments so im not sure if you will see this or it was already brought up but portion sizes play a big role in this. It can be very deceptive too. If you are consistently eating larger meals without realizing it your stomach will consistently grow to accommodate that. You can see this in studying competitive eaters prepare for food challenges. \n\nIf you are used to cleaning your plate you may not even realize that your meals are getting larger. \n\nWhen eating in a restaurant I will frequently ask for a to-go box for my meal at the beginning and put half away before I start to help prevent mindless eating while talking. I purposely sought out smaller plates for our home as well smaller plates make the same amount of food look bigger and my brain thinks Im more full. \n\nThe biggest thing here is probably American hospitality. As a visitor here, we are absolutely going to try to feed you and feed you the special occasion stuff because you are a visitor and we want to be good hosts.",

In American, the diet is high in refined carbs, low in saturated fat, in some homes high in vegetable oils.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, my thinking is this is the main difference which would be consistent with what you are experiencing.

We get a big dump of dopamine when we eat a good-tasting, mineral-rich food, and our brains are soaked in feel-good chemicals. \n\nFood manufacturers have dialed up those flavors to eleven, so chips/crisps, for example, are so salty, they trip those happy triggers to make our brains say, \u201cMore!\u201d The slogan, \u201cYou can\u2019t eat just one chip,\u201d is literally true if the salt content is doing its job. \n\nOver time, our brains are trained by the cycle of dopamine soaks to crave snack/fast foods so in many cases, it\u2019s similar to actual addiction, chemically speaking. Out of balance brain chemicals have to be retrained in the brain to relearn what healthy food is. \n\nAmerican food manufacturers want to keep us in the cycle, of course. More $ for them. \n\nEuropean foods have much more stringent restrictions on preservatives and e-numbers through the EU and so things like high fructose corn syrup aren\u2019t as pervasive. The food is much more natural, less sugar-fueled, and more nutrient-dense, so it stays filling for longer. \n\nTake two dinners, identical ingredients sourced from America for one and Europe for the other, and the European one will be more satisfying for hours longer, less sugary, and less chemically laden than the American one.

Something about being freshly made, and full fat in yogurts, meat, milk etc.  yes there are low fat options, but I do think there is less healthy fat content in American food.",

Most americans don't like these things for their taste and you're likely eating a lot of starchy, carby, fluffy bases without the fiber or added protein. It's often a little more expensive, or bitter, or tastes or feels weird to them and they will resist. Same with dark chocolate or carbonated water without syrup in it. I'm guessing we also eat more meat and fewer vegetables in our meals.",

                "CPI =/= inflation. \n\n[CPI is merely a PROXY for inflation](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/07/consumerpriceindex.asp) preferred by the Central Banks because it can hide how inflation affects different segments of society differently -- see: [the Cantillon effect](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/biflation.asp). \n\n> Creating an abundance of cheap money via banks does not automatically mean that demand for everything will rise simultaneously. Instead, history shows that certain assets take favor over others, leading to rising in some areas of the economy and falling prices in others. \n\n> Because money added to the economy (through lending and asset purchases by the central bank) or removed from the economy (through debt write-downs and liquidations) happen at specific points in the economy rather than in all markets simultaneously, both inflation and deflation tend to occur as processes over time with differential and sequential changes in prices in different markets. The resulting relative price changes that occur may confuse observers over whether the economy is undergoing overall inflation or deflation.\n\nIn fact, asset prices have increased while wages have fallen behind. \n\nThose who must spend more on necessities like housing and food than the basket assumes can experience far greater price increases than CPI suggests, because they CANNOT afford to buy those items that have increased less. Likewise, CPI assumes substitutions that are unlikely and/or represent a decline in real value. \n\nMeanwhile, those who own the assets Banks inflate with loans that increase the money supply WITHOUT increasing the supply of goods and services benefit from these inflated assets. So, when your Landlord claims they need to raise your rent because of inflation or interest rate hikes, understand that rent-seeking Landlords CAUSE inflation and the higher interest rates that *supposedly* address inflation -- they are NOT victims of these increased costs. \n\nIf interest rates are supposed to punish unproductive speculation, then paying higher rents to keep up with the increased costs would only thwart this mechanism. But the Central Banks are NOT telling us to stop paying higher rents. [They're telling employers to stop paying higher wages. ](https://www.thestar.com/politics/political-opinion/2022/05/04/wages-are-not-keeping-up-with-inflation-and-thats-the-way-ottawa-likes-it.html)\n\nRegardless of CPI, in terms of their share of production, wages still CANNOT keep up with the inflated prices of our asset bubble. \n\nRemember: any measure that becomes a target ceases to function as a measure.",

But the Heinz sweet & sour sauce helped balance things out and did make it better.   The fries were tasty, especially when dunked in gravy.   However, I gotta say, the portions were a letdown. It definitely didn't seem like a meal worth 1300 calories. Not sure if this is the usual serving size, but it felt like they skimped on the fries (I went there 2.5 hours before closing).  Overall rating: 5.5 out of 10. Would I order it again? Probably not unless I was really craving some chircken strips, it would have been more fulfilling grabbing a slice of pizza and a hotdog for less money, but that's just me.

                "I honestly think star rail gives us more pulls because the games punishes you if you don't expand your character roaster via pulling imo. Unlike genshin where you can pretty much ignore a lot of fodder units or characters you don't like till the end of the game and focus on the ones you like. This is one of the reasons I am skipping kafka cause I am forced to build sampo or Luka to enable her DoT mechanics and I don't even have a sampo yet\ud83d\udc80",

                "Its more a product of necessity imo - have you imagined what kind of hell a player would face without certain characters at higher EQ? In Genshin Impact you can partially compensate for bad/low-tier units with personal skill and execution, but in Star Rail kits and stats determine everything you can do. There is no Xiangling nor Bennett to help carry a Star Rail player as well.\n\nLike I've already seen threads around here of F2P players hitting walls as early as the first fight against Belobog's final/weekly boss. The current weekly boss of the Xianzhou Loufu is even worse, and a free and decently-built limited 5\\* character thats well-suited to take advantage of the boss' weakness is provided to you.",
                "It\u2019s generally not good to compare gacha based on free pulls alone. Eg. A low quality 2D gacha may give out hundreds of pulls in a months, but your pulls are mostly folder and even the rare units will get powercrept next month, making progression pointless.\n\nThe investment needed to clear genshin story and events are extremely low. You really could just level 1 dps, and toss in 3 low level support for reactions and to destroy shields and it\u2019ll be fine. You can freeze most enemies with a lv1 Barbara and kaeya for example.\n\nIn star rail, you can\u2019t dodge, all four are on field so they all get hit, and you need to match weaknesses. If you try to freeze anything 15+ levels above you with March 7th, it\u2019s not going to work. The story bosses are not a cake walk if your teams isn\u2019t levelled. You essentially do need those extra pulls and resource for a comfortable experience.",
                "more pulls AND a guaranteed 5 star from the beginner banner. not bad at all.\n\naltho its apples and oranges. I still think it was a bit scummy to not give a 2nd 4-star healer. \n\n300 pulls for the standard guarantee also feels like overkill but it's something they never gave us in genshin I guess.",
                "What's with y'all and your love for mentioning Genshin here this past week?  Every time i scroll down here there is bound to be a Genshin slander lol. Meanwhile none could be said in the Genshin sub about mentioning HSR, weird.",
                "I just want a standard 5* selector in Genshin how it worked in Star Rail but it better be retroactive because I'm sure I've done at least 300 pulls on the standard Genshin banner. \ud83d\ude05",
                "While we do get more for pulls.. We need to build 8 characters synergy toward each other in a party of 4.. And we can't evade enemy hit so our time building characters is probably double from genshin too..",
                "They don't have exploration rewards since chests per map seem to be pretty limited. I'm guessing they do this to compensate for that?",

                "Not everyone likes turn based games. So to make other people change their mind and try star rail they gotta be a little generous.",
                "It needs to. Different skill expression in combat, you don't really \"control\" your units to the same depths as in Genshin, everyone is always on field to be hit so you can't get away as easily with hyperinvesting into your most valuable units only, you could smartly get around with a lot of things in Genshin that you can't do in Honkai.  \nCase and point, with a subpar early genshin account I was already 36\\*ing abyss at this point as I am now in my hsr career, and in HSR I can only clear half the stars in MoC even though I have a limited DPS unit and a good subdps standard one unlike in my early genshin life. \n\nAside from that, the world itself is a lot more flat, literally. Exploration in Genshin adds a lot more replayability and \"content\" even if there is no resin or events, a player could technically just wander around killing mobs, collect fodder and stuff.\n\nWe need more pulls to keep us engaged, but I'd argue that Genshin needs to hand out a lot more too seeing how ever-growing the roster is.   \nJust imagine how miserable the new player experience will be in Genshin for those in the future when it'll have 80+ characters to choose from and the same amount of pulls to spare, with either double banners taking ages for anyone to rerun or triple banners meaning an even bigger pressure of pulling but not having the primos for it.",
                "Cmon guys can you pls stop mentioning genshin on this subreddit or any topic that irrelevant to star rail? you guys sound like insecure or having superiority complex because you guys keep comparing star rail on genshin. Ngl this sub remind me of hi3 subreddit and early tof subreddit posts because of how often they compare their favorite game to genshin.",
                "These Genshin comparisons are getting ridiculous.  They're two fundamentally different games.  Genshin you can get by with one or two invested units due the the nature of the combat (action based and only a single character out at any time).\n\nStar Rail, on the other hand, *requires* multiple teams to be invested in in order to properly progress, and if you happened to get unlucky and miss out on seele or silver wolf your straight outta luck on being able to clear MoC.\n\nThe fact that Star Rail *only* gives 100 more pulls is actually pretty bad, because we are *FAR* more reliant on our characters than Genshin is.",
                "It\u2019s because in HSR you kinda *have* to have a roster of characters from every element or else battles will be a huge slog where you can never stagger enemies. Genshin never requires specific elements, outside puzzles, and only occasionally requires you to have one of several elements to break shields.",
                "I mean, I\u2019m still gonna play Genshin Impact tho.",
                "The exploration also comes into play. Each new region added to Genshin gives about the equivalent amount of Primogems for 10 pulls, probably a bit more especially if you count the special \"trees\" in each area. So HSR giving out 10 free pulls each patch is essentially the compensation for the resources you would otherwise get had this game have an exploration mechanic as massive as Genshin's.  \n\n\nThat and also the points here raised above by others in how the gameplay really does force you to build up a roster more than Genshin. In Genshin, you can pretty much cheese your way through all the required content. It's only really Spiral Abyss that demands more from the player in terms of team building, though even that is a bit arguable.",

                "How much of the extra 100 is saturated with non limited? The weekly SU has 13ish, HSR 1.0 has the 40 non limited event, not sure if there was an equivalent in Genshin. But the overall gacha in HSR is better, the limited weapon/extra standard at 300 etc. \n\nAnd we sacrificed jumping for that /s",
                "well the main difference really is your physically not capable of progressing the story if your characters are under lvled and powered in HSR while in genshin you can dodge nearly anything in the game. also comparing free pulls it not really a great comparison you can have a shty gatcha give thousands of free pulls but it won't fix how shty it is.",
                "Does Genshin have lightcone-like items in banners? Bc I swear 90% of my pulls are lightcones.\n\nAlso, we need 4 decent characters to make team, and almost can't use 1 character to hypercarry. So 4 times the resources.",
                "I think the main reason for all these free pulls is because HSR is still a niche game and Mihoyo is aiming at way better player number base.\n\nAlso, the fact that it's a turn base will keep this game quite niche compared to Genshin so it will never reach the numbers of Genshin. Mihoyo knows all of this of course, and they were fine with it from the beginning, they wanted to have an income with a different game to diversify their investments. And so far it's going really well, but they want to push it more by keep on giving free pulls on HSR.",
                "Well yeah unlike genshin, HSR doesn't have any \"big\" areas to explore. Like in genshin a new areas have like what? 100 chests? Honkai doesn't have that kind of stuff\n\nAt least that's one of the reasons",
                "Let's not forget that the game was build very much around the ability for a solo carry to push a whole team ahead.\n\nAnd two of the starter 4 stars are top tier units still today, better then all the starter 5 stars lol\n\nThat said, Elemental weakness could be brutal at times, immunity is much worse then less dmg taken.  \nThen again, good old Razer would carry you through those situations quite fine",
                "Is this counting chests because genshin had hundreds more that gave a thousands more primos total",
                "Because with HSR it is a requirement to have at least four good characters built otherwise it's difficult to survive in a turn based game. With Genshin you can clear the game (with difficulty but doable) with just the starter characters and people have done that as part of challenges.",
                "Food for thought? These things were pretty clear way earlier. HSR is a turn based gacha, a market over saturated that hoyo needs to make efforts to please the players to stay on their game, where for genshin...they have literally 0 competition, they don't give a fk",
                "It's cuz you can get by in Genshin using the starters, but I doubt the same can be done in HSR. Both games require luck and grinding to get the best possible artifacts/relics, but HSR doesn't require any kind of skill for you to engage in combat.\n\nGenshin isn't a particularly difficult game either, but it does require you to have a modicum amount of skill, no matter how small, if you're not keen on spending or pulling on banners - having said skill compensates for your lack of anything good early-mid game which HSR doesn't need cuz it's either you have good characters and builds or you don't.",
                "I actually don\u2019t know but wasn\u2019t Genshin the first hit? I think they needed a lot more incentive to bother with a game from a lesser known studio back then. Star Rail did well on just hype from prior phenomenal releases alone.",
                "Well Genshin-Pulls(Chars) are so much more worth, we play with them not watching them during auto-play",
                "Honestly not surprised at all. I usually do a 10 pull each time a play even if it is just relaxed short session, like doing dailies and doing some side quests.\n\nIn genshin tho, it was a rare ocasion",
                "and for less work  \n\n\nbut seriously i always thought that genshin should give more wishes",
                "And? What the fuck kind of point do you think you're making?\n\nYou need to collect more characters in HSR than Genshin does to survive in combat. So of course they're going to give more pulls so you can fill your roster. \"Oh but this character can solo this game mode\" \ud83e\udd13. You bet there'll be one or more characters that kind solo combat. But surprise surprise, you can do it with any character in Genshin.\n\nStop comparing HSR and Genshin, both are ultimately a different kind of game. Besides mihoyo win either way and there's nothing to gain for you. Maybe if you wanted to be a clown, then go ahead.",
                "People are saying Star Rail only gives you more pulls because the hard content requires you to expand your roster. What the heck are y'all talking about? This is a gacha game, we play this to collect characters. You will pull regardless of whether you can clear MoC already or not. The fact that HSR gives you more pulls to get more characters which is the point of a gacha game??",
                "Y'all seem to be forgetting the MHY was just a small indie company when genshin was released and they couldn't afford to be handing out free pulls to everyone. \n\nNow with the success of genshin, they've increased their size to be a moderately sized indie company and can afford some losses.\n\nEdit: /s. I thought it would be obvious that MHY isn't a small/moderately sized indie company. They are massive with >5000 staff",

            "selftext": "I (29F) have a niece (5F) who is my SIL's (24F) daughter. In the beginning of this year, her boyfriend left her and she has been a single mom since. She is going through a hard time right now trying to balance raising her daughter while working a minimum wage job. \n\nBecause of this, I offered to babysit my niece on most weekday evenings so her mom can work extra shifts and not worry about paying for a sitter.This arrangement has been going really smoothly for the last two months. My niece is an absolute angel and we have gotten so incredibly close. I've noticed whenever we've been over to my SIL's that her fridge is severely lacking in fresh foods. I totally understand how expensive grocery shopping can be and how much of a privilege it is to buy fresh food each week. Therefore, I don't blame her one bit. When I first started babysitting my niece, my SIL instructed her favorite foods were \"frozen chicken nuggets and fries\" and she insisted that she'd be happy if I fed her that every meal. \n\nPersonally, I'm super big into cooking. I'm also very into nutrition and making sure meals are well-balanced. So I couldn't bear to just feed my niece chicken nuggets and fries at every meal knowing how unhealthy the two are long term. I began to introduce her to more vegetables and meats/seafood to make sure she was getting adequate nutrition. Recently, I've made her pan-seared salmon, steamed chilean sea bass, ma po tofu, peking duck, lemon asparagus, braised bok choy to name a few. And the thing is, she absolutely LOVES every single dish! I also blend her a fresh fruit and vegetable smoothie every evening as a little dessert. My niece has turned into a huge foodie and will try anything I cook. She's even taken an interest in helping cook alongside me.\n\nI didn't see anything wrong with what I was doing until three days ago my SIL called me to confront me. She basically told me to stop feeding her all this \"fancy rich people shit\" and accused me of trying to turn her daughter against her. Apparently, at home, my niece now refuses to eat chicken nuggets and requests to eat a bunch of foods I make. But, a month ago, I ordered a bunch of  fresh groceries to their home because I knew my niece had taken a liking to my food. However, a few days later, I asked my niece if her and her mom had cooked anything and she said \"no\" and that her mom had thrown most of it out. I was appalled, but chose not to confront my SIL. It made me livid to have her bash me for caring for her daughter's well-being and nutrition. I told her as such and called her ungrateful for throwing out my groceries and that she should be thankful her daughter is eating well. That did not end well and I heard her start crying on the other end before just hanging up on me.\n\nI do feel for her (and I told her as such), but our top priority should always be her daughter's well-being, which I feel like she's putting aside by asking me to stop feeding her. Am I not seeing something here? AITA?",

If your SIL doesn\u2019t have the time to cook fresh food, naturally it would need to be trashed, and she doesn\u2019t need you criticizing her for struggling\u2014which is what you did by calling her ungrateful for a gift she definitely did not ask for.\n\nIf you want to consider your niece\u2019s health at home, please consider asking your SIL if you can prepare frozen meals to defrost, or hell, even invite her to dinner weekly to foster not only healthy nutrition, but healthy familial relations.",
                "ESH.\n\nYou SIL should not be accusing you of trying to turn her daughter against her. She spoke and acted irrationally and in anger.\n\nBut OP, you also spoke in anger. Your SIL didn't *ask* for those groceries. She doesn't have to be grateful for something she didn't ask for, and apparently didn't want. You gave her yet another thing to do on top of working over 40 hours a week as a single mother to a small child, didn't say a word to her about it, then were \"appalled\" when she didn't do it the way you envisioned.\n\n>Am I not seeing something here?\n\nThis is what you're not seeing, and I hope this helps:\n\nYour SIL's partner left her. She is a single mother to her child she gave birth to at 19, whom she has had to give up spending time with in order to work constantly so they can afford to survive. She's exhausted from working extra and double shifts, in what I'd guess is a customer-facing job that requires a lot of energy. She's lucky enough that her in-laws will watch her child in order for her to do this, but those in-laws are better off and have more free time, so they do things differently at their house, including doing meals differently. One day those in-laws just order a bunch of food she doesn't want to her house, without even talking to her about it, which she almost certainly viewed as extra work at minimum if not also silent judgment of her household and parenting choices. She tells herself repeatedly that she's tired, and she'll make it \"tomorrow,\" the way most of us have done at some point in our lives, and some of it goes bad so she throws it out. Or she is peeved, it's not what she would ever buy or make, and she throws it out because she never wanted it in the first place and those in-laws are not going to financially guilt her into doing things their way.\n\nThe final straw is when her own child starts rejecting the frozen food she fixes a couple nights a week because it's not like what Aunt OP, who already gets to spend almost as many waking hours with SIL's daughter as SIL does, makes. She's already stretched almost to the breaking point, and her kid is now refusing to eat because she's not at good as Aunt OP. She can't do anything about her kid, so she calls up Aunt OP and admittedly irrationally accuses Aunt OP of trying to turn her child against her, and she has no other options for affordable childcare, so she asks Aunt OP to stop making fancy stuff like \"pan-seared salmon, steamed chilean sea bass, ma po tofu, peking duck, lemon asparagus, braised bok choy to name a few\" \\[Yeah , you say in comments that you also make simpler foods, but you listed all these things for a reason and I'm sure your SIL heard all about them\\] for her kid, which she has absolutely no ability to make, and is interfering with her home life with her child. Aunt OP calls her ungrateful for not using the groceries she never even wanted, and which were designed to make her spend extra time and energy she doesn't have doing things Aunt OP's way, and adds that SIL should be grateful that her daughter eats well at Aunt OP's house.\n\nShe is stretched to breaking, and what she heard in that conversation is you snippily tell her that she should be grateful you're giving her daughter nutritious food that she can't manage to give her daughter herself.\n\nI'm not saying she's right. Yes, it's a great thing that her daughter is eating well and getting to try all these different foods she probably wouldn't otherwise.\n\nBut of course she cried.",
                "NTA. But, you sound like you aren't a parent. The only reason I say that is that you don't seem to recognize that the biggest source of vulnerability and sense of inadequacy is the ability of a parent to care and protect their child. What she heard from both you and her daughter is that she lacks the means and ability to adequately care for her child. Her partner left her. She's broke and overwhelmed. The last thing she wants to think about doing right now is learning to braise bok Choi. I would strongly suggest that if you really do care about your SIL you take the high road here and apologize (even though you are right) and give her a gift card to a grocery store and tell her that you respect her choices in her circumstances.",
                "NAH. \n\nYou are very kind for everything you're doing. But I feel you're blind to SIL's reality. Sending groceries is NOT helpful to a person who has neither the time or the skills to cook like you do. Your niece has developed a liking for your cooking. I imagine even if her mum did set down a plate of steamed veggies (which would be healthy) down for her, she would still refuse to eat because they are \"not tasty\". You both have to find a solution for this that doesn't place unrealistic burdens and expectations on SIL but is also best for the child.",
                "Your SIL might be taking the food as a dig at her ability to provide for her child. Like you are trying to snub her. Especially when you sent her groceries unasked. It's like sending someone a dog because they once said they like dogs. Maybe it's the perfect breed and everything but it is extra work. If she's depressed, and being recently singled can lead to that, just getting the mental space to water a plant can be too much. Anything that adds extra work isn't really much of a gift. It's an obligation. She might have been really thankful of you had asked first. She isn't feeling seen. And while it would be appropriate to have a chat with your niece about finances before hand that ship has sailed. You can't really blame the little one for asking for these foods. But putting the discussion of how hey mom can't afford to on mom's shoulders, wasn't very thoughtful either lightly ESH. Ideally she would have the mental space to be thankful for your care and kindness behind the act. But she doesn't have that, and you didn't consider it either. Apologize for adding to her load and not asking and reiterate your desire to help and INVOLVE HER in decisions that affect her life.",
                "NTA at all. I have kids. Every reasonable parent would be happy that their kids is eating healthy. I can understand the moms frustration, kids pick up habits and routine very fast. So now, she can't feed her child at home.\n\nHowever, the mom must educate the child, that there are home rules and aunty rules.\n\nOther than that, you offered to support her with food, maybe show here how to make one Aunty dish that is healthy yet fast and easy, and most importantly, to the liking of the little one. However, it will never be 'that', since it it is not made by Aunty....\n\nMy son is somewhat of a picky eater. My mom got him to eat Omeletts for breakfast. He was excited. He loved it. He asked me to make him that for breakfast. I don't have tome in the morning to make eggs, since I go to work but my mom doesn't. So I had to explain that I can only do it in the weekend. But I naturally prefer a child eating eggs on the weekend than not at all... But he refused them after a couple of times, since it doesn't taste exactly like what his Omy was making.\n\nThe mom is being unreasonable and is letting her pride take precedent over her child. Sad to see someone finding I'll intentions where happiness could be found.",
                "INFO: why don't you send an extra serving for niece to eat at home?",
                "NTA. My grandparents fed me and my brother much more nutritious food, as my mum was struggling to make end meet on 100 dollars a month(that's how much she was was earning in our local currency). There were nights when we only had toast and tea for dinner.\n\nMy mum was grateful to my grandparents  for providing the food we needed to be healthy. She didn't once held it against them, because she knew that she couldn't do much more. \n\nI'm not saying that your situation is the same, but you SIL needs to get over the embarrassment and realise that you're helping her and your niece. A kid cannot live on frozen nuggets and chips. She needs the help, so she needs to accept it.\n\nLike others have suggested, prep and freeze some meals for her. That might go a long way. Good luck, OP.",
                "I'd say either NAH or ESH\n\nYou have good intentions and nutrional food is indeed important.\n\nHowever I think you fail to see this from your SIL's perspective.\n\nBecause as nice as it is that you purchased those ingredients for her, their are several concerns.\n- Does she even know how to cook with them herself?\n- what if your help disappears? For whatever reason.\nShe'll be stuck with a child who doesn't want to eat anymore or where she can't afford the food her kid wants.\n\nYour SIL probably could've voiced her concerns better instead of berating you over the phone.",
                "I think ESH slightly. \n\nI know you were trying to do the best by her, but I think you went about it the wrong way. \n\nIn addition to fresh food being expensive, it can also take a bit more time to not only make but to learn how to actually cook it. \n\nIdk how it went down but she may have thrown out the groceries because they went bad and didn't have time to use them. \n\nI think mom/SIL could have tried some basic fresh recipes. But if you are tired popping chicken/fries/pizza in the oven is faster less work vs cooking fresh. \n\nI think you could have slowly tried to help teach your SIL how to cook, kinda like a 3 way bonding experience  Some of the dishes sound like they might be more elaborate/time consuming. I know some are not but if you don't know it might seem like it is.\n\nIf I want to make a new dish it might take me 30/40 to find a recipe learn how to make it then prep is almost always double the time they give. Once I know it, it can be quick. Throwing something together with fresh stuff can be quick but it comes with practice. \n\nAlso SIL might not be able to afford to consistently buy fresh food.",
                "NAH. You're doing loads to help. SIL is probably very stressed and feels judged. Good luck.",
                "You aren't trying to be the AH, but it might be best to take a step back and see from your sisters perspective.\n\nYou're cooking these meals you have time and know how for and she isn't. To her this could seem really 'one up' y. Who is going to look like the better grown up? Well it's you. Does that mean your sister doesn't love her daughter? Absolutely not.\n\nYours outward damnation of chicken nuggets, to me comes across as AH. She's a wee girl. What would be the issue with some peas or broccoli at the side of the plate to make sure she gets her veggies? Your refusal to engage in that, as if it's not good enough, sends the message that your sisters efforts are not good enough.\n\nThis is a rough one because at every turn you all want what is good for the kid, but I could understand if your sister read your efforts as being self righteous.\n\nShould kids only be raised on chicken nuggets? No.\nIs it wrong to feed them nuggets? No.\nIs it OK to damn nuggets, if it's the quick and filling option a busy, working parent has? No.\n\nYou are not the AH, but you should come up with a feeding schedule for the kid some foods your sister picks and then special 'recipie nights' you can flex the cooking muscle with. Everyone needs to be on board so the kid has a sense of unity between the adults. Otherwise there is a risk of the kid 'picking a side' which isn't good for anyone here.",
                "Totally NTA. You\u2019re making your niece nutritious food, and you love cooking. She is incredibly ungrateful for throwing the food out.",
                "NAH. This is a sad situation. You\u2019re trying to do right by your niece. Making her healthy meals and introducing her to new foods is awesome. \n\nBut this is clearly a very stressful time for your SIL and she\u2019s overwhelmed. I think you bore the brunt of her frustration, which definitely isn\u2019t fair but I can also see how her daughter demanding more complicated meals than nugs from the freezer could be a burden on a single parent with two jobs. \n\nMost importantly: it\u2019s in your niece\u2019s best interest that you two peacefully work this out. Maybe you and your niece can meal prep simple things together that SIL can throw together in a jiffy. Or make frozen meals that are as easy to reheat as nuggets. Fighting will only add to your SIL stress and possibly cause her to isolate you from your niece.",
                "INFO: have you ever said to your niece that chicken nuggets are not a good food choice and your meals are much better?\n\nEven once? \n\nMore often?\n\nCould that be why she is refusing to eat that with her mum anymore?",

                "NTA\n\nYour SIL should be grateful you were helping.  I think she felt threatened which is kind of strange but she must be under great stress to blow it on you.  The fact that she cried tells me she need some serious help herself.",
                "Yeah, you are not seeing something here.\n\nYou say you understand the situation your SIL is in, but it's clear that's not really the case.\n\nFirst of all, she *doesn't have time* to cook and clean up afterwards like you do. She is working long hours, and I'm sure when she comes home, she wants to spend her free time with her daughter, not ignoring her while she does housework. So when you sent over a bunch of fresh veggies, what was she going to do with them? Of course they got trashed.\n\nNot only that, but those \"fresh foods\" probably felt like a slap in the face. What do you think your SIL thought when she got them? They must have seemed like a criticism of how she was feeding her daughter, and therefore of her parenting in general.\n\nPlus, it rubbed in her face the fact that you have the time and money to be the mom to *her* daughter that she doesn't. I'm sure she would like to stay with her daughter on weeknights and cook nice meals. But she can't. And she probably feels guilty about it. Plus how must it feel to see that her daughter is close with you, when in a perfect world, that's the relationship she would have with her mom? \n\nYour comments in that light are pretty nasty. Instead of understanding that she's upset that her daughter is becoming accustomed to a lifestyle she is not able to provide, you basically told her *I'm looking after your daughter's well-being, even if you're not.* No wonder she was in tears. \n\nI would call her and apologize. Tell her you want to keep feeding her daughter the way you are because it's healthy, and if you can offer to send leftovers for them to have on the weekends. That would be 1000x more helpful than groceries she has no time for.",
                "NAH\n\nI get that you were trying to help and it came from a good place, but if you sent your sister a bunch of fresh ingredients without talking to her first I can see as how that might come off to you sister and a passive aggressive way of shaying she is not a good mom.\n\nLike others have said, if she is working full time, she is trying her best. She probably doesn't have the energy to cook a complicated meal.\n\nTalk to her, start with an apology that acknowledges her struggles.

And you're sending her extra homework and telling her she should be grateful.\n\nYou're doing a kind thing by trying to look out for the kid. You are. But you need a serious reality check on your expectations. If you want to help, ask her what she needs. If you want to feed her kid, ask her if it's okay for you to prepare fridge food. Send her kid home with a casserole they can eat for four nights; don't make her have to google how to make mapo tofu after she gets home from an 8-hour shift.",

You can give her some healthy extras along with her meals or have the occasional day of something \u201cnew\u201d to eat. \n\nYou accidentally started an \u201cauntie food good, mom food bad\u201d divide. Which can quickly evolve into \u201cauntie house good, mom house bad\u201d and it snowballs from there. \n\nThis is common when split parents have the arrangement where every 2nd weekend the kid stays at the fathers house and he tries to make up for the lack of time with lots of fun activities and ice cream and staying up past bedtime. The father becomes the fun one and it makes life for the mother hell even though he has only good intentions. That\u2019s why consistency is so important for kids that age",

From a 5 year old. \n\nWhat you COULD do instead? Look into meals that are less expensive to produce. You have indeed been a bit of an ass by picking out expensive and complicated dishes - niece doesn\u2019t have any awareness of this and can only recognize what she thinks tastes good. To a young kid all meals take about the same amount of effort and they have no idea about costs. \n\nHealthy eating can be done on a budget (which may still be out of SIL\u2019a reach, but is more attainable). Same with easy-prep meals - you can make healthy ones. \n\nI\u2019d suggest you start planning menus that are healthy, cheap, and easy prep.

You're already feeding her an expanded diet the others, and by teaching the kid good meal habits, she's liable to someday take on that effort herself. A better way of going about this would have been to ask your SIL why it was causing issues and open the way for her to express her anxieties, so that you could help her overcome them and offer to teach her a few dishes she can then make with her kid, or to work a fun spin on chicken and fries into your time with her to refreshen the dish and bring bring back out of purgatory.

She's now a single mom who is broke, works long hours, has a toddler to care for, and probably feels like she's being \"shown up\" by her daughter's auntie who is an excellent cook and well-off enough to buy expensive ingredients and also has the time to cook them into tasty meals. \n\nNow her daughter is refusing to eat the food (yes, chicken nuggets and fries) she can provide because it is inferior to the food she gets from you. It would be the same thing if you took her daughter for rides in a brand-new Mercedes while her mom had to take the bus and make her ride it too, and then the daughter refused to ride the bus anymore. \n\nA better solution might be to offer to meal-prep a few days' worth of meals for them, and also offer to teach a few simple dishes that aren't time-consuming or difficult. (However, even this might be a bridge too far). \n\nPeople who enjoy and are good at cooking don't often recognize that for most others, cooking is a dreaded chore, particularly at the end of a long, stressful day where tearing open a package, pressing a few buttons on the microwave, and plopping on the couch to watch TV and eat your (admittedly unhealthy) fare is all you want to do. Practically *any* cooking entails a fair degree of making a mess in the kitchen - a mess which will need to be later cleaned up.

That\u2019s a big issue in the US. When I\u2019ve lived abroad, smaller portion sizes are the norm. Here in the US a family of 4 seems to be the default portion size. When you have to get each vegetable separately, it\u2019s often more expensive, takes much longer to prep and you end up with a lot of waste. My go to tends to be getting a rotisserie chicken and then using the meat in a variety of dishes.

SIL then starts feeling she can't  do anything right, even providing a meal for her child. Plus starts feeling like she's losing her child to you - niece excited to be with you, brags about you as 5 yr olds do,  and compares SIL to you. At least that's how SIL feels.\n\nShe's tired, stressed, worried, scared, she simply can't handle any more pressure - real or not. So she lashed out. Please be understanding.  Her entire world has flipped. She no longer has a partner to share life's challenges,  it's now all in your SIL.\n\nIts understandable that you're hurt that your efforts aren't being appreciated and worse tossed in the trash. So you lashed out in return.\n\nWhat you've been doing is very nice and loving, but SIL views it as another thing she's not doing right - especially when her daughter asks why her mom can't do what aunt does. It's another pressure added to everything else. \n\nYou need to talk and apologize. You didn't do anything wrong,  but it was taken as wrong. Your SIL is burnt out. Exhausted. Can't cope. \n\nAsk your SIL if she had the time  to cook, what would she love to make for dinner and would she mind you making it for her. \n\nThink of meals you can cook and freeze that she can put in the fridge the night before. \n\nTo help in what to offer, think in terms of what money she has left after rent, car payments,  cellphone,  nrw kids clothes, etc. That will give you an idea how much SIL has left to spend on food. You may be able to afford lobster, but SIL can't, and she can't compete. Work within her budget. This way if she decides to make it herself,  she can afford to and not feel here's another thing she can't do. Include a recipe card.\n\nGoogle healthy cheap recipes. Offer to make the whole meal for her. Think in terms of tired and just want to sleep,  not pots pans cooking cleaning.\n\nYou could cook ground meat, diced green/red peppers/onions/mushrooms then add to spaghetti sauce. Make sure everyone liked mushrooms. \n\nBoxed spanish rice, follow instructions but  add sliced kielbasa and add chopped tomatoes, cook. Plenty for all 3 of you. \n\nThey are basic but a step up, bit healthier, and time wise what SIL could do if she had the time and energy. \n\nShepherds Pie is another idea and can be frozen. \n\nMeat loaf leftovers can be sliced and used for a sandwich. Added to spaghetti sauce. \n\nDon't go overboard  - always ask. Say you were thinking of making x for dinner, did it sound good to her cause they'll be enough for everyone. Or ask what she's in the mood for.  \n\nSIL may only be okay with you doing this once a week till things get better between you both. \n \nNAH",

You're stomping aaaall over someone else's turf here, and you haven't shown sufficient cause.\n\nHer diet is her mother's job, and that woman doesn't need a condescending SIL  sending over ingredients that meet her standards to pressure her to change what she's cooking. She also doesn't need you convincing her kid its Chilean sea bass or riot.\n\nYou're telling this mom that her lifestyle and the life she's making for her family aren't good enough to you, so you've sent her...

This comment is NOT accusing you of copying anything. Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nI (29F) have a niece (5F) who is my SIL's (24F) daughter. In the beginning of this year, her boyfriend left her and she has been a single mom since. She is going through a hard time right now trying to balance raising her daughter while working a minimum wage job. Because of this, I offered to babysit my niece on most weekday evenings so her mom can work extra shifts and not worry about paying for a sitter.   \nThis arrangement has been going really smoothly for the last two months. My niece is an absolute angel and we have gotten so incredibly close. I've noticed whenever we've been over to my SIL's that her fridge is severely lacking in fresh foods. I totally understand how expensive grocery shopping can be and how much of a privilege it is to buy fresh food each week. Therefore, I don't blame her one bit. When I first started babysitting my niece, my SIL instructed her favorite foods were \"frozen chicken nuggets and fries\" and she insisted that she'd be happy if I fed her that every meal.   \nPersonally, I'm super big into cooking. I'm also very into nutrition and making sure meals are well-balanced. So I couldn't bear to just feed my niece chicken nuggets and fries at every meal knowing how unhealthy the two are long term. I began to introduce her to more vegetables and meats/seafood to make sure she was getting adequate nutrition. Recently, I've made her pan-seared salmon, steamed chilean sea bass, ma po tofu, peking duck, lemon asparagus, braised bok choy to name a few. And the thing is, she absolutely LOVES every single dish! I also blend her a fresh fruit and vegetable smoothie every evening as a little dessert. My niece has turned into a huge foodie and will try anything I cook. She's even taken an interest in helping cook alongside me.   \nI didn't see anything wrong with what I was doing until three days ago my SIL called me to confront me. She basically told me to stop feeding her all this \"fancy rich people shit\" and accused me of trying to turn her daughter against her. Apparently, at home, my niece now refuses to eat chicken nuggets and requests to eat a bunch of foods I make. But, a month ago, I ordered a bunch of  fresh groceries to their home because I knew my niece had taken a liking to my food. However, a few days later, I asked my niece if her and her mom had cooked anything and she said \"no\" and that her mom had thrown most of it out. I was appalled, but chose not to confront my SIL. It made me livid to have her bash me for caring for her daughter's well-being and nutrition. I told her as such and called her ungrateful for throwing out my groceries and that she should be thankful her daughter is eating well. That did not end well and I heard her start crying on the other end before just hanging up on me.   \nI do feel for her (and I told her as such), but our top priority should always be her daughter's well-being, which I feel like she's putting aside by asking me to stop feeding her. Am I not seeing something here? AITA? \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*",

Maybe she's exhausted & overwhelmed trying to work multiple jobs, care for a child, and keep up with housework? Cooking, especially fresh, complex meals, can require a lot of prep & cleanup. Even something as simple as cutting up fresh fruit might help, or prepping smoothie ingredients so she can just add milk to them. \n\nIf you genuinely phrased it as \"our top priority should be her daughter's well being,\" that's also the kind of statement that is going to force her to be defensive because it comes across as an attack, as if she's not doing enough for her own child, when the reality is that she's probably do the best she possibly can.",

She also needs to understand and appreciate what her life is about. Meaning you and your sister working together to give her a stable home life and a healthy future. Maybe start having some chats about your sister working to pay the bills while she stays with you. Understanding that when she goes home what is there comes from hard work, and the food is what is obtainable under the circumstance, and she should appreciate that by eating without causing a fuss to make her mother feel bad. Approach it as a team effort.",
                "I\u2019m not calling anyone an AH, I think the SIL just feels super inadequate and every time you show her up (in her eyes), she sees a sign over her own head blinking out \u201cBad Mom.\u201d She\u2019s trying hard to keep her life afloat and take care of her kid, so feeling an extra burden of perceived judgement has to sting.  I don\u2019t think that is your intention.  And you are doing a good thing by exposing the kid to a variety of cultures, frankly, through food.  You are sparking potential interest in her that may last a lifetime, or at least her making better health choices.  So I guess approach SIL with \u201ckid gloves\u201d and start with assuring her you think she is a great mother who is doing a good job keeping a roof over her baby\u2019s head.  Acknowledgment of her effort and struggle will hopefully make it easier to help her understand you are not looking down on her by sharing food with her daughter.",

Not only is this healthy for her, but it will serve her well in later life when, one hopes, you can teach her to cook. \n\nIn terms of your SIL, the thought of her throwing out food is appalling.  But I'm sure she's exhausted with the demands of work and felt resentful, thinking that you expected her to come home and put time into preparing complicated meals involving lots of effort.\n\nIt would be a kindness if you could show her very simple ways to prepare fresh food quickly.  As in, show her how to steam vegetables or toss them in the oven for a very short time with some oil drizzled on them &  some salt & pepper (if she objects to using other spices).  Make sure she has a steamer and a pan to roast the vegetables.  Hacks such as how she can cook corn on the cob et all super-fast with zero prep in the microwave.  How she can just wash fruit and hand it to her kid.  Extremely simple ways to broil fish very quickly with minimal effort,, or easy things with which to coat chicken before throwing it into the oven.\n\nPerhaps if she understood that she doesn't have to spend a long time in the kitchen preparing Peking duck, but can use some very basic skills to prepare tasty fresh food inexpensively without a ton of time or effort, she would be likelier to feed herself and her child more nutritiously.\n\nNTA",

                "NAH\n\nthings I will add may have been said by others.\n\nI've eaten at fine restaurants in New Orleans, Chicago, New York As well as my family. I didn't know what good food was until my first visit to NO. I got cookbooks and learned to cook very well. But outside of vacations, I cook on a budget. Veggies are better than many herbs for good seasoning while being cheaper and more filling. I do have a well-stocked herb cabinet that developed over time with onion/garlic powder and maybe some chili powder and sweet basil and paprika for the first staple spices.\n\nYou should start with easy dishes that your niece can make (also that sis can make ) where they can work together. Roasts are cheaper and what is more of a comfort food than a pot roast with carrots onions potatoes and turnips. Or a pork shoulder made into Posole, beef stew, bolognaise with linguini, Chili, vegetable soup. Easy to make foods made cheaply with leftovers. It takes just as long to make spaghetti for one dinner as 8. And these could be made by niece with minimal help from mom, or vice versa, I think. And a Vadalia onion chopper makes short work of onions, green peppers, and celery for those with poor knife skills. Pancakes for a breakfast treat and they can keep in the fridge or freezer if it is a big batch. My family is as happy to have me cook as to go to a fine restaurant. And cooking from scratch is cheaper than buying frozen. I occasionally make pizza totally from scratch, but I still keep a frozen pizza around when I don't have time to make the dough. You just Dr it up with extra cheese and some onions and mushrooms and maybe Gr beef or pepperoni. And who doesn't like an occasional sloppy Joe. \n\nWe're going for fairly easy, fairly fast and fairly cheap and pretty good.",

OTOH, sending \"raw materials\" groceries to the home of a single parent working a minimum wage job who has limited time was not a smart, supportive move. \n\nBut sending completed meals that her daughter helped make? That might touch her heart and get past her defenses.",
                "NTA\n\nYou're being a fantastic aunt, and your sister is being ungrateful to you and borderline neglectful to her kid.\n\nThe idea that she would blow up at you for feeding her kid well is beyond outrageous. Her throwing out groceries is also completely obscene. Beyond the idea of food waste, she could at least appreciate the gift and not literally throw things out. It's beyond spiteful and shortsighted.\n\nIf she doesn't have time to cook much, that's understandable, but that still doesn't justify throwing things away or blowing up at you.\n\nShe should certainly not be feeding her childish that he died of chicken nuggets and fries. Especially not when the kid clearly enjoys fresh fruits and vegetables and meals with varied tastes and complete nutritional profiles.\n\nMaybe you could get her email kit delivery subscription, if you're so inclined, but only if she swears on her life not to just throw them in the trash.\n\nAt any rate, you should keep cooking at your niece delicious and healthy, varied meals. If she's not getting them from you, she might not get them at all.\n\nYour sister-in-law needs to get over herself. Seriously. You deserve an apology.",
                "I know this sounds weird but maybe your SIL is so tired or a bad cook that she hates cooking.  My recommendation is that you look into sending meal kits such as Hello Fresh or the like. It comes in a variety of different meals and can accommodate healthy meals. The best part is that every thing is included in the box. \n\nWhen my daughter was in college we sent her a box each week with 3 meals for 2 people.  She loved it because it was fresh and she didn\u2019t need to figure out what was needed. The recipes are really easy. She kept all of the sheets and now cooks without the kits.\n\nJust a suggestion instead of sending stuff that she may or may not use. Plus, the kits are great to have kids learn too.",
                "Yeah well.. looks like she feels that she can't provide for her daughter and you went the all out holyer than you route.\n\nWhat you don't understand how incredibly strong the need to care for a kid is and that also includes being able to provide for the kid.\n\nFor her you really really rub it into her face that she can't.\n\nAnd THAT s whe she was WEEPING at the end!\n\nFrom a practical view you are right though but that isn't the issue here.\n\nSo Nobody is the assholes here but work that out guys!",
                "I\u2019d just stop feeding her & wouldn\u2019t watch her anymore. You gotta follow the moms rules liking it or not!",
                "Keep feeding her good food. Apparently you are the only source for good nutrition. I hop that your nieice forces her mother to step up to the plate and learn how to cook. Cooking does not have to be fancy but fresh fruits and vegetables along with a protein is not a big deal. If she has a cell phone then she has You Tube and can learn. Her mom is lazy. NTA. zI'm 59 male and did the vast majority of cooking in my home, not fancy at first but became quite elaborate cooking dishes from around the world. If I can learn and grow so can she.",
                "NTA - But it depends on how you do it. If you know SIL can't afford the same level, don't demean SIL by saying she's neglecting the kid or anything, but it needs to be done diplomatically and letting her maintain her pride.   \nWhen I was growing up, I had an aunt who would take me to fancy lunches and teach me etiquette. My parents were more modest but they understood that it was also important that I knew how to act in a formal dining situation and appreciated the gesture.  I do the same now for my nieces and nephews, and they know it's a special occasion and not something to expect from their own parents everyday.",
                "NTA. If you have a child you need to put their needs before anything. Feeding your child ONLY chicken nuggets and fries is straight up abuse. It's easily malnutrition which causes a lot of health issues in the future, and can impede a child's education massively. Now you could have taken initiative to offer a better solution than just sending groceries sure, but still nta. I fully understand the difficulty of working doubles and having to care for children. But that's still your child. You don't have to be Bobby god damn Flay but at LEAST add some frozen veggies/fruits into their diet ffs. Frozen vegetables are $1.50, $3 max. The myth that eating healthy is impossible if you're poor is a very effective myth perpetuated by people who don't want the population to be food literate. What you could really do is offer to cook dinners for them if you can, even if just like once or twice a week. Or pack school lunches for the child."

                "I'm not sure what the \"worst\" is, but the biggest *mistakes* you can make with fair food \n\n* **Buying from the \"Kitchen Sink\" concession stands.**\n   * I mean those carts that have more than maybe like 5 things on the menu,all scrolling confusingly around the top of the sign. \"Pizza! Gyros! Bugers! Cotton Candy! Lemonade! Funnel Cake!\" all in one stop? Hard PASS.\n   * This is simply a waste of precious tummy space.\n   * The more specialized the menu is, the fresher and better that one thing is gonna be. Pronto Pup, About a Foot Long Hot Dog (one near the hippodrome is best), Curds from Mouth Trap, Onion Rings from Danielson, Stuffed Peppers from That Pepper Shaped Thing...They all do one thing, but they do it damn near *perfect*.\n* **Avoiding the Fruits, Veggies, and Farm Provider Educational Stuff that's \"good for you\" and \"lame\".**\n   * Corn on the cob. The Apple Grower's Booth. The Produce Exchange. The Honey booth.\n   * They might not seem sexy, but the stuff they are selling is *fresh* and it's *great*, and often you can't get it otherwise without going out to a farm yourself. \n   * Bonus, the growers or enthusiastic volunteers who actually care a lot about honey or apples are often working the booths (though probably not the cash registers). They are AMPED to get you excited about honey or peaches or goat milk cheese, and they'll give you new products you *can* find after the fair, new ways to approach your familiar pantry staples, and new MN favorite snacks for after the fair. \n   * They're also some of the best *deals* at the fair. $4 for corn. 50 cents for an apple ice pop. $3 for a bowl of ice cream. Can't beat it.\n* **Obsessing over the New Foods**\n   * If the line for the New Hotness is too long, you don't have to get it. No one will shame you. If it's *great*, it'll be back next year. You are officially absolved. (by some rando on the internet)\n* **Playing It \"Safe\".**\n   * You can get a good burger and a Miller Lite at the State Fair. You can also get that *anywhere else, too.*\n   * If you just go for the stuff you've had before that you know you're gonna like, you're missing the point. Fairs were, and remain, exhibitions. Try something new and weird. Try the pickle beer and the burger with the weird cheese or bun that you normally wouldn't. And if it sucks, that brings us to...\n* **Not Sharing.**\n   * Just like you don't fill up on the rice or bread rolls at a Las Vegas Buffet, the State Fair is not the place to hoard your cheese curds.\n   * Even the very best fair food gets to be a bit much by the end of a solo journey to the bottom of the bucket.\n   * It feels real bad to throw away a bowl of ice cream with one bite out of it.\n   * Most fair foods are finger foods that split easily; Have 5 cheese curds instead of 35, 4 onion rings instead of 20. Split that footlong. \n   * Bring a collapsible plastic camp cup, or get a flight of beers from the Hangar or the Craft Brewer's Guild early. Wash out the little cups with some bottled water or visit the Culligan booth. Stack em, and carry on until you find a new weird beer or drink to try. Then decant the single 12oz Weird Pickle Beer into 4 smaller cups and share with your homies. Now you can try 3 additional Weird 12oz beers. \n* **Sharing Everything** \n   * Some stuff doesn't split well. Corn. Ice cream cones. Apple Pops. Paletas.\n   * There is something to be said for the moment of sublime, selfish, hedonistic pleasure as you just wolf down a treat you've been waiting a year for. Which brings me to my final but perhaps most important point...  \n\n* **Apologizing For Your Fair Food Loves, or Shaming Others for Theirs**\n   * State Fair food should be about joy and fun and discovery. It only comes once a year, and the entire format means that no one should have to compromise or pass on something they love.\n   * My partner does not get why I love the Corn Roast. I don't get why he loves his Funnel Cake. But we love each other and we love seeing one another get to enjoy that moment of sublime, selfish, hedonistic pleasure. \n   * Don't mock people, friends or other fairgoers, who choose healthier options like apples or hummus for not \"getting it\", and don't shame people for loving on their sloppy grease bombs. If milk disgusts you, skip the AYCD Milk Bar and Dairy Barn, don't stand there sneering at people who busted out the lactaid for their annual Sweet Martha Dunk. *Party foul*.",

This time I said I\u2019d try the obscure things that I didn\u2019t give a second thought about or ever gets talked about.  This happened to be one of those things.

Single items that flop don't usually come back.\n\nNow, as far as whether there are very unhealthy or very overpriced items, there certainly are.    Any single item that is in the neighborhood of 1,000 calories deserves a second thought.  For most people that is either two meals or something to be conquered with team work.\n\nI think the biggest disappointments I've had are usually reliable items that happened to be made poorly in that one instance.  Either the vendor was super busy or there was a problem in the supplies or whatever.  I tend to not rock the boat and just sulk away with it, which is probably the wrong choice.",

            "selftext": "I've (28) been living with my roommate (47F) for just over a year now, and it certainly has reached a point where she doesn't give a crap about basic respect.\n\nShe's started eating my food -- usually taking a few handfuls of my bulk trail mix, bananas/other fruit in my fruit tray thing, using the last of my creamer and leaving the empty carton in the fridge. \n\nThe main offense is that she took half of the oatmeal date bars I had baked for my work crew that week (we had a chaotic week at work, and I wanted to show thanks to my crew for dealing with the craziness as it's my first real go at being a supervisor/foreman on site). This one upset me the most, I saw it as completely selfish.\n\nI have asked her twice, on different occasions, to stop eating my food and that I would be happy to share some , *if she had asked*.\n\nShe keeps denying taking my food, once even suggesting that \"maybe you [me, OP], actually ate more than you thought\". Which is equally disrespectful because she body shames me too which I don't take to heart anymore because she is almost 50 and acts like a college freshman.\n\nI just came home from a weekend camping trip, and most of my trail mix is gone, yet again. She isn't struggling for money (that I'm aware) -- she works for herself and frequently buys health food/organic/gluten free foods, where the food I buy is your standard fare, just the occasional treat (chips/a nice ice cream/whatever). She also has a major Amazon Prime spending problem (which she is aware of), and gets atleast two packages a week (once I got home to six amazon boxes). So she can't not afford to buy some snacks for herself, she just never does.\n\nI've started keeping some of my snacks in my bedroom, which I obviously don't want to do, and shouldn't have to do.\n\nWhat should I do? Child locks on my pantry cupboard? \n\nThe little petty kid in me is tempted to bake something and put laxatives in it and leave the tray out. I will consider any creative answers.\n\nI am very likely going to be moving out before the end of the fall regardless, for numerous reasons.\n\nEDIT: Holy crap this blew up. Well, do to other reasons that I won't get into (petty shit, if I can be so honest), she had a complete meltdown and I brought up the food thing and she was swearing and wailing like a banshee, denying everything. I immediately was like \"fine. Whatever , I'm over it\". \n\nI already have a new place lined up, and am moving in a few weeks. Thanks everyone for your input.",

I'd get a shower caddy and remove all my stuff from the bathroom, and even keep my spices in my LOCKED bedroom (if you can't lock it, there's another thing to consider). \n\nAnd finally, yes mess with your food, among other things. I'd definitely make a baked good with laxatives, when your milk or creamer is low, fill it back up with water. I think you should also consider that she is using your other products, so fill them with something fun. \n\nI'd set traps for her everywhere- bleach in the shampoo (say you were doing some cleaning), something weird in the milk, laxative in the brownies!",

Make a sweet looking chocolate bar or oat bar again, but go HAM on the salt content. Like 10x the amount of salt. Not poisonous, just tastes bad.\n\nOr if she hates brussel sprouts, make brussel sprout bars.\n\nGet creative!

And I'm sure it will make her think twice before stealing from you again. \n\nMy more reasonable advice would be to put cameras in your kitchen (try to go for ones that can work without wifi bc if she's smart, she will just disconnect the internet when she wants to snoop around) and also lock up your cupboards. It sucks but it's what you got to do until shes out. \n\nShe's gaslighting you, so it would be rather funny if she was doing so and you pulled up footage of her in the act.",

And maybe find a box that you can lock and put inside the refrigerator and one for the freezer (although I find this quite drastic and ridiculous to have to do).

Most people can think of a couple kids that came from families that had little to no money.

Why was that ever a thing.  \nIt would be like having to pay to use desks in the classroom.  And if your parents didn't pay up you only got some uncomfortable stool to sit on.",

Money is not the issue. And people that balk at feeding children are disgusting.\n\nTo make one billion dollars over a 40 year career, working 2080 hours per year, all you have to do is make $12,000.00 an hour. If you have 20 billion all you need to do is make $240,000.00 an hour. Tax the effers, then your burden will decrease. It's not rocket surgery.",

There are many districts facing massive sped deficits, and I would argue that there are more sped kids than there are people who would benefit from this program (since there was already some degree of lunch assistance available for most).\n\nI say this as a parent of an IEP kid who had to stop going to his gifted and talented programs and lost some of his para support because the district has been facing deficits for the last few years even before we added several new mandates this year. Our district is one of the highest tax rates in the county, so it's not a statement of 'tax more'...\n\nI'm not saying it's not a good thing to feed kids, but it sure seems like he's trying to keep everyones attention glued to this one point and shying away from some of the problems that have popped up.\n\nAgain, just me being anecdotally frustrated with my own experience, which is admittedly a very privileged one.",

It's never a privilege to cook for entitled, ungrateful, infantile assholes. \n\nI would suggest marriage counseling, at least a few sessions, but he sounds like the kind of guy who would refuse to go. So here's a suggestion I learned from a therapist once that has helped me several times in my life:\n\nWrite him a letter. Take more than 24 hours so A, you can make sure you don't leave anything out, and B, so you can make sure the tone is calm and clear. Then, sit him down and eead it to him, asking him to listen until you're done. Then, give it to him. The fact that you took the time to do this and sit him down will let him know how serious this is to you. \n\nIf you do this, I hope you mention him feeling entitled and that it's no privilege to take the time and effort to cook for ungrateful people. And that you're a mature human being who would simply never, ever make him bad food on purpose. You're not childish. Tell him how badly he hurts you and that you don't deserve that. Tell him you'd be happy to never cook for him again and he is welcome to live on fast food, as he mentioned. Tell him his hurtful words is not the same as not lying or just being brutally honest. Honesty does not require brutality and if he loves you, he wouldn't hurt you intentionally. Be clear with him that he needs to stop this behavior or it will push you away from him at some point. A real man in love would be grateful and kind.",

It sounds like he'd then attack you for not cooking which shows you can't win and it's not about the food, and if he's going to keep cutting you down and hurting you like this then, well, sod that and I'm sorry.",

Cook for you and your children but nothing for him, and if he asks where his food is, just tell him that since he does not value the effort you put into cooking for your family, then he can go get his own food elsewhere. But also to avoid issues with your children being upset that dad gets takeout and they don't maybe quietly sit them down and explain that daddy said some hurtful things about your food and is acting like a child now. So you will not be cooking for him until he realises his mistake. And if he continues to be disrespectful, I'd say look into couples couselling, and if all else fails...divorce as a last resort.

                "My girl.\n\nI am very sorry this is happening to you.  None of it is your fault, and you didn't do anything to cause it to happen.  It's abusive, plain and simple.  Your husband is entitled to a ridiculous level if he thinks it is a privilege to cook for him (or do anything else, for that matter).  Good lord.  Everyone else is handling that part, so I wanna address something else:\n\nYour title asks how you can \"make him see\" it's hurtful.  You say in the post you \"tried to get him to understand\" that's it's mean.\n\nAssuming that A - he is fluent in, or a native speaker of the language you are communicating in, and B - he has not suffered any sort of injury/impairment/condition which affects the part of the brain which processes language - why do you think he doesn't *understand?*.  He *understands* just fine.  He *knows* it hurts you.  He *is aware* that he is being a jerk.\n\n**He does. not. care.**\n\nSo please throw out the notion that he \"just doesn't get it\", he just thinks you are less than him, and that you should be catering to his needs.  And apparently (good lord, again), thinks you should feel *lucky* to do it for him.\n\nSo if for some reason you want to remain with your abuser, and provide the current example of an adult relationship to your children - who believe me- are picking up the vibe whether you argue in front of them or not- then my advice is:\n\nlet him eat fast food.\n\nCook for yourself and the kids.  He said he could easily do it, right?  Cool, let him.\n\nBut real talk?\n\nDon't stay with your abusive husband.  It's bad for everyone.  Except him.  it's bad for you, for obvious reasons, but it's bad for your children as well - both for the example you are setting, and for the fact that TWO, separate, functioning households are better than one dysfunctional one.\n\nGood luck, my girl.",

Get you large baking dish, add a few tablespoons of the extra chicken oil later to the bottom of your dish when assembling), some peopel add a little tomatoes sauce but I don\u2019t, add a squeeze of lemon or lime juice to your chicken mixture just to add a little extra flavor, assemble and roll with folded sides down, I like to stuff more filling in so it\u2019s packed.

Gave detailed notes on food access, litter box access, etc. \n\nOn her last visit she texts that she can\u2019t find our adult cat (15 years old) \u2014 we let her know she\u2019s probably just hiding, no big deal. \n\nOur flight home gets delayed 24 hours so I ask a friend to stop by and do one more pet check. He stops by and says \u201cwas the door upstairs supposed to be closed? Kiki was up there.\u201d \n\nIt was NOT supposed to be closed! We never gave this instruction. We had no idea why this would happen. It had not been closed all week. \n\nMy wife checks our Ring camera and sure enough \u2014 there\u2019s the Rover, closing the upstairs door. Our cat was trapped upstairs from Wednesday until Saturday with no food, no water, no litter box. We are lucky she didn\u2019t die and I\u2019m extremely concerned for her health going forward \u2014 I\u2019m writing this on the flight home and kind of freaking out. \n\nWhat do we do about Rover in this situation?? I feel like this person should not be able to pet sit again. This was a grave error. I also feel like we should be entitled to a refund at minimum. What does this community think? This was our first time using Rover and I\u2019m furious.\n\nUPDATE: Wow well this kind of blew up. Some of you think the sitter did nothing wrong. Others think the sitter massively fucked up. There\u2019s some consensus that I need to do a better job 1. securing my doors and installing additional cameras so this can\u2019t accidentally happen again, and 2. communicating with future pet sitters about not closing doors via account notes, post its, etc.  \u2014 I am learning from this and taking it all in. I guess I will add that like\u2026in twenty years of owning a cat I have never, ever had this happen before, and it just so happens it\u2019s with my first time booking through Rover. Make of that what you will I guess. \n\nA couple of people seem genuinely concerned for the well-being of our cat, which I appreciate. We are ~ still ~ in travel hell on like hour thirty of flight delays (and this isn\u2019t on a cheap online, as someone suggested lol) \u2014 but friends have checked in and we can see her doing ok on the cameras, she\u2019s eating and drinking and keeping food down etc. \u2014 I will do another update after we get home.\n\nUPDATE #2 \u2014 We are home now. Our senior cat is eating wet food and allowing us to pet her, she\u2019s purring and following us around, etc. and seems to be moving fine \u2014 we are repositioning cameras on her water and litter box to make sure that\u2019s all happening ok. There was so, so much pee on our bed. This ended up being like 33 hour delay door to door and it\u2019s late here \u2014 tomorrow the plan is to evaluate with trusted vet first thing. \n\nI\u2019m going to take a pause replying to people. I appreciate the kind messages. There\u2019s part of me that wants to delete this post because some of the messages have been pretty toxic and shitty, but there\u2019s lots of good advice here as well, and I think the whole thing could be valuable and eye opening for others.
