I hate that we don\u2019t get singles anymore with b-sides, especially when you used to get CD1 and CD2 and they\u2019d have different non-album tracks. Plus I think the way music was released back then forced you to really listen to it, in a much more considered way. Now it\u2019s too easy to listen to the first few notes and hit skip. Back when I was buying everything on cassettes, fast-forwarding wasn\u2019t really that great as you had no idea how long to do it for to skip one track and it was more economical in terms of battery life up just listen to something rather than try and bypass it.

And what did the leaders do with these gifts? Two things: 1) developed for profits, or 2) buried/ignored \u2026 for profits\n\nSo now NHI are looking down and scratching their heads. The human leaders said full disclosure would collapse all societies and the NHI, being benevolent, do not want that. Human \u201cleaders\u201d said they\u2019ll take care of the disclosure process and use the tech to better mankind, but the leaders haven\u2019t been fulfilling their end of the exchange (\u201cWe gave you an energy source that won\u2019t destroy your planet\u2019s habitability, why aren\u2019t you using it?!\u201d). \n\nSo the NHI want to better humankind but can\u2019t trust the \u201cleaders\u201d to trickle down the gifts they give them, but if the NHI just land and introduce themselves like in a movie we all might \u201close it\u201d and they\u2019ll destroy the very civilization(s) their trying to help.

They get that data through soil samples, examining the air bubbles stuck in ice from thousands to millions of years ago, tree rings, and a lot of other ways. So climate scientists have a good idea of what those cycles are, and can use that to predict where it should be in the future, within a few degrees of certainty.\n\nThe other facts are the earth is warming up faster than almost any other point in history. The only real change that would throw that cycle out of whack would be humans and all the things we do to the land, air, and sea. So yeah does the earth naturally warm and cool? Yup.

            "selftext": "Costco definitely justifies having a membership. Up until the pandemic, it was where I got about 80% of my groceries. These days, I am getting lured away by more convenient options.\n\nI have started buying some bulk items on Amazon that just show up at my house. Target lets me do all my shopping at my desk, and I just swing by and the load it in my car. Sam\u2019s club allows you to do all of your shopping on the app, and just walk out the door. Even more importantly, they have a website that allows you to see what is in stock at their warehouse. \n\nI try not to shop at WalMart, but credit where it is do, they are rapidly adapting to the new retail landscape, and allowing you to preorder, or have things shipped very easily. \n\nMy main issue with Costco is that they seem dead set on not adopting modern technology to improve their experience. The whole asking for photo ID, at self checkout is emblematic of their wrong headed priorities.\n\nThey need to be doing everything to speed up the lines, and get people moving through their stores with less friction. It seems like things are taking longer, and with more modern technology many people could either not even step foot into the store, or move through seamlessly like with Sam's scan, and go. \n\nIt seems like Costco doesn\u2019t respect peoples time. You can\u2019t even see what is in stock online. Do they not understand how frustrating it is to drive 30 minutes just to realize they have arbitrarily stopped carrying a product out of nowhere, or it is out of stock?\n\nI understand that there is a certain degree of \"treasure hunt\" built into their business model, where they want you to discover a product you didn't know you needed. That is fine, but in this day and age, I want to know that the product I do need is there, and I want options on how I procure it. \n\nFor now they are still my number one source of groceries, but I can see a day where other retailers completely usurp them by making their services efficient, and convenient.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n All this comes from a place of love. I support Costco, and always feel good about spending money with them, because they do right by their employees, and have treated me well as a long time customer.

In any event, these are mine:\n\n***Customer Service Chat***: It\u2019s a waste of time in my book. Let me talk to someone and resolve this quickly. On Chat, you get people who are barely, paying attention, copying and pasting prompts left and right. I mean soon they will be replaced by AI that you can\u2019t reason with anyway. But still.\n\n***Digital Downloads (Over physical releases)***: I\u2019m not averse to streaming because it\u2019s afforded me the ability to discover all sorts of new music. But if I ever want to buy an album, I will either buy the hardcopy CD from the bands bandcamp page or I will buy a record. But I will not put money into something digital that can be revoked at any moment. It\u2019s just not practical.\n\nThis rule goes double or even triple for movies. I\u2019d much rather have a 4K Blu-ray.\n\nBooks on the other hand, I don\u2019t really care. I moved around a lot and the whole romance of \u201cThumbing Through and Smelling the Pages\u201d wore off pretty quickly when I had to schlep around  boxes of books (that I mostly read once and never again) everywhere.

Our public transport network hasn't accepted cash for half that amount of time so the easiest way to use them is to... tap the card. Pretty much any shop anywhere, even the back woods middle of nowhere will have a card machine that accessors contactless. I've lost count of how many times I've left the house with just my phone in my pocket, no wallet, because all my cards are set up for apple pay contactless. It's just a part of every day life now. \n\nAnd QR codes only really found their legs during COVID when all the restaurants didn't let you order at the bar and didn't have staff coming around to take orders, so the only way to order was via the codes.

I've discovered who's willing to stay in contact with me when communication is in person or over a phone chat. My relationships have grown and deepened. There's nothing like tidying up my home and folding laundry while talking on the phone with a friend who's doing the same thing for 45 minutes. I've never experienced that before and it's so wonderful.\n\nIt can also be very isolating. There have been times when I'm with friends or family and the conversation will suddenly stop when one person takes out their phone to look at something and everyone else follows suite to check their phones. Conversations are also interesting. I've noticed people only talk about themselves or cut others off to share their topic after the 5 minute break where everyone else looks at their phones.

It would go from 10-8 to 10-9 to 9-9 to 9-8, I think now they're at 10-8. They wanted to go back to pre-COVID hours, which was 9-10, but stores were upset because no one had the payroll or the coverage, so they didn't abide by those hours.\n\n Also, mall management was really slow on holiday hours. We would ask for at least 2-3 weeks in advance because of scheduling, but they wouldn't tell us until the week of or the day before. A few times, they even switched it up, saying we were regular hours. Then, day before at close, they'll send a notice saying the mall will close a few hours earlier or that it wouldn't be open at all.\n\nThe QR is pretty pointless, though, because they don't really update it as much anyway.",

                "The absolute gold standard in translation technology is the universal translator from Star Trek, which brings to mind three particular episodes.\n\nIn Darmock, the alien's speech is based on reference so although the translator did a bang up job of translating what they said, it completely failed to translate what they meant.\n\nIn Ensigns of Command the Sheliack can speak most federation languages but even with the translator they can't communicate with them in their native language. Even if it does a bang up job in one place, that doesn't mean it'll do it to the same standard everywhere.\n\nAnd in Statistcal Probabilities, one of the characters disables the translator to hear what someone said in their native language. Two words in foreign translate perfectly servicably to one word in English, but the nuance was lost and by listening to the original critical information was uncovered. Certainly a translator is helpful, but true understanding is going to be lost.\n\nTechnology is great, but it's been going to kill language learning for as long as I've been alive and will presumably be killing off language learning any day now long after I'm dead.",
                "It will never be able to fully replace humans, at least not within our lifetime. I imagine it\u2019ll be great at handling clearly enunciated, relatively formal communication. It will be awful at handling mumbled, slurred words, lots of slang, short phrases that rely on non-verbal context, choosing formal vs informal forms, code-switching, etc. Plus it\u2019s going to be slow - languages have different word orders, and sometimes you\u2019ll have to wait for the entire sentence to start translating.\n\nContext, particularly, will be brutal. While I don\u2019t think these situations are likely to come up between people without a shared language (or possibly ever), I think they do illustrate the complexity involved:\n\n1. Adam says to Bella, \u201cyou\u2019re home late,\u201d and Bella responds in German, \u201cich hab\u2019\u2026 ich hab\u2019 meinen Freund getroffen\u201d; how long a pause does it allow before it translates the first two words as \u201cI have\u201d, confusing the English speaker? Assuming that doesn\u2019t happen, it still has to wait for the whole sentence, as the most likely translation would be \u201cI\u2026 I met up with my boyfriend\u201d\n2. Adam says to Chiharu, \u201cit\u2019s so good to meet you!\u201d; Chiharu speaks Japanese, so how does it translate that? I\u2019m not very knowledgable about Japanese, but I believe there would be multiple ways to say that depending on the relationship between Adam and Chiharu, and the translator has absolutely none of that context. It\u2019s a bit easier with Bella, where if she says \u201cFreut mich, Sie kennenzulernen!\u201d, the translator at least knows this is a formal situation and/or there isn\u2019t a close relationship (or it will have a stroke and assume Bella is using the third-person plural).\n3. German uses the same word and same conjugations for the third-person plural, and the second-person formal (Sie). Sometimes that can be figured out from other context in the sentence. Sometimes it needs non-verbal context, or at a minimum previous sentences.\n4. Any time someone uses a single word, with non-verbal context filling in the rest. e.g., Adam comes home looking dejected, and in response to Bellas look of concern, says \u201cfired\u2026\u201d. Does Bella get \u201cabgefeuert,\u201d \u201cgeschlossen,\u201d \u201cgebrannt\u201d, \u201chinausgeworfen,\u201d or an essay explaining all possible meanings?\n\nNone of this is *fatal*, but I think as a consequence anyone using this will always have a worse experience than someone who speaks the language even semi-fluently, and I suspect you\u2019d be looked down on for relying on it.",

Modern firearms didn\u2019t stop everyone from using a bow and arrow as a hobby or for hunting notwithstanding firearms\u2019 obvious superiority in the situations for which they both were created(e.g: hunting & war). So even if this tech gets really good many will still likely learn a language.\n\nAlso translation without cultural understanding can lead to big miscommunications, even if the translation is technically accurately translating the meaning. In one culture, for example, the use of profanity may be more common and seen not as big of a deal. Or if a language has many different speakers like spanish, in one country a word or phrase may have one meaning, connotation, or \u201cdegree of offensiveness\u201d whereas another country those may be meaningfully different.  Perhaps this is a solvable problem, but i doubt it\u2019s been solved yet.\n\nI\u2019d also imagine this in some way might even be able to aid language learners in ways I cannot foresee.

AI can do that.\n\nBut as soon as your need extends beyond mediocrity, AI won't cut it anymore.

That said this is still just a gadget; prone to breaking, being lost and probably nowhere near capable of picking up all slang and nuance flawlessly. \nFinally, I think the people posting about this and similar inventions as if it were the end of language learning, miss a crucial reason people learn languages in the first place: to assimilate. My goal with learning my TL isn't to just get by as a tourist. I want to assimilate into the culture, I want to consume the content, I want to create things with the language, and that is a goal no tech can carry me to.",

                "Human language isn't simply a means for communicating data in an accurate way. Every language on earth exists within it's own historical and cultural context and with a language comes certain ideas and assumptions of how the world is and also how it should be. And in learning a language, you are at least taking in an understanding of how the given language's culture views the world, human society, ect. I think that those who merely want to get by in another culture will use this technology, whereas those that actually want to *understand* a different culture will realize that they have to learn that culture's language.",
                "It will reduce some language learning to be sure, especially in situations where you don't have time to learn a significant amount. However, I think it will primarily expand the amount of interlanguage communication that happens in the world. Imagine watching any international TV show with the babel fish in your ear. Imagine traveling anywhere and having that technology available. By just learning the basics in a foreign language, you'd be able to do so much more. Much like a lot of technologies, it will actually enable more people to do more things. Personally, as someone who is a moderate level in a number of languages, I would use it in conjunction with my language knowledge to do better in a real-time situation.",
                "To be clear, this is really exciting technology, and I think it's great. That said...\n\nLearning a language does more than give you the ability to communicate; it also forces your mind to think about language and culture as variable, somewhat arbitrary systems. In English we primarily say \"my name is\". Other languages default to \"I call myself\" or even \"they call me\". What does that imply about identity, locus of control, etc.? Learning how to navigate formal vs. informal language can teach you a lot about social structure. Language both reflects and influences how people think about the world. In the process of learning a language, you also learn a new culture and mindset.\n\nPlus, actually being able to speak/write a language well means that you have an individual voice that may or may not come across in translation, especially real-time translation. \n\nI'm also interested in the decisions a translating AI would need to make. *Espero que saques buenas notas* could be \"I hope you get good grades\" or \"I expect you to get good grades,\" and - just like a human translator - the AI will have to decide which one the person means. It will have to correctly assess the appropriate level of formality for a particular interaction even when the source language doesn't make those distinctions (e.g. English to Japanese). Can the AI accurately translate between languages that use word order vs. intonation for emphasis? There are all sorts of things that go into communication beyond the basic meaning of the words, and it'll be interesting to watch the technology deal with them.",
                "For talking and listening? Not anytime soon. But for writing and reading, online translators are doing fine already.  Even google translator does the job for simple texts. For complex texts, even native speakers already need help sometimes.\n\n\nStill, people who are nearly or fully fluent wont have to worry anytime soon. It is another thing for A1-B1 level people. It will be a great help for them. And one day, even native speakers (or C2) will profit from it because they are still very far from perfect.",
                "For me, language learning is a hobby, just like baking. Could I go out and buy a cake that someone else made? Sure. But I enjoy the process of creating the cake from start to finish. Language learning is the same way. I don't do it because I need to, but because I enjoy the process. I like learning different grammar structures, and the cultural meanings behind certain phrases. I like learning the different idioms that are used.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo while it's cool that technology is coming where language can be translated in real-time, I think that people like me who do this for fun will still be asking for textbook/YouTube channel/podcast recommendations so that we can improve our vocabulary and oral comprehension.",
                "This might work practically for workplace situations, if the technology gets good enough. \n\nHowever, there's so much human connection that's only achieved when people speak directly to each other in the same language. Languages contain so much intrinsic context, perspectives and culture.\n\nI don't think you can ever connect to a person at a deep level without speaking the same language,\nregardless of translation technology",

Google translate is far from perfect and the functionality already exists in phones and we all know it's bad. I mean I guess it's good when you want to at least get an idea of what's said but it's far from perfect. Even the most advanced \"AI\" can't reliably perfectly translate from any one language to another.\n\nEven humans can't perfectly translate a lot of the time but translation is something we often blindly trust to be right. Would you be ok with just making that assumption and not knowing for yourself? There will always be a need for language learning because blindly trusting technology is a recipe for disaster. The tech itself needs to be taught by someone and simply plugging in dictionaries doesn't do it.",

So what's the point?? Will it work also in video-games?? A lot of people learn English on minecraft, fortnite or lol servers, so if it translates only audio from non-devices a lot of people will keep learning English.\nIdk, i don't really find it useful, except for like my grandma who has 81 y/o.

                "First, most people learn languages because is *fun* for them. Because is a hobby and it's fun to learn. To see nuances and to be able to say the words you want in a new language that you like the sound of; to read a book in a new language and struggle but when you get to end of it you feel that sense of accomplishment; to speak with an elder in their language and be understood and to understand them; to get that trick grammar part that took you soo looong to get but that someday just slots in place; to watch a tv show without subtitles and not get most of it in the beginning and then watch it again some time later and get all. It's fun. Simple as that. People will keep learning languages because they like to learn.\n\nAlso, at the practical side of it, I honestly think that any person would be annoyed that they have to wait while your earbud translates their sentence to you so that they can continue with another sentence or so that you can answer. Daily conversation is smooth and usually very quick.\n\nPlus any normal person would get a little sensory overload with this earbud translating what the person said to you in one ear, while they keep going with the conversation. How it would know what to translate? For example: you are at a restaurant and a lot of people are around you having conversations. How will the earbud know that they need to translate only the person that you are with? This is insane and, ok, maybe it will work for some scenarios with less people but honestly, learning the language by yourself is still better.\n\nAnd also, most natives get really happy to see that someone is doing their best to learn their language so that's why they wait and help when you are on the beginning/intermediate phase. I would honestly be so annoyed at some foreigner that comes to my country and uses this earbud and I have to keep waiting while it translates for them every single time, because they are not even trying to learn the language but I needed to learn their language or another common language like english to be able to answer them (as most natives will not have this pricey earbud to be able to translate the foreigner sentence).",
                "Google Translate is so awful LMAO",
                "Two thoughts:\n\n1. Language learning can be majorly redundant if you speak English anyway. I understand how arrogant that sounds, but almost everywhere I've travelled, English is so common that I don't need to know a thing in a different language.\n\n2. This is a pretty handy piece of technology, but no one should be threatened by it as a competition to their own capabilities. As advanced as it may ever become, it will lack the personal connection that comes with speaking someone's language. Instead, consider it as a useful tool to enhance your own skills."

Congress is clearly gunning to crucify wherever this financial blackhole is coming from. Especially when they can use these whistleblower claims as pressure, it's probably their best shot at making the public care enough to make this happen.\n\nand\n\n\\- [Gaetz told the story that sounds like it may have been the spark for some of this. Gaetz details how his office had received a protected disclosure](https://www.youtube.com/live/TtYY1mGPnQw?feature=share&t=6467)and went to go investigate at eglin with Burchett and Luna. The AF leadership wouldn't let them see anything until Gaetz himself was allowed to observe radar sequences and images of UAP. Additionally the feedback he told from the pilot's perspective about reporting was pretty disheartening and makes it clear that Ryan Graves lobbying for reporting protections is so important. TLDR: Congressman just said during a hearing that he's seen images and evidence of UAP.",

I'm not suggesting the photo he speaks of is of a mylar balloon, but I can say for sure that a mylar balloon in thermals would look like he is describing reflecting the warm ground below and the cold sky above.\n\nI'm hoping it's a crystal clear unambiguous photo.",
                "That's interesting, but I don't think Luna has the qualifications to look at a photograph and declare it is something no government on Earth has. I don't think anyone does, but if anyone did, Luna would not be on the short list.",

                "This comment is interesting:\n\n1. She states, \"... I also talked to pilots of something...\", so it appears that there are pilots, American pilots, flying these things.\n2. She states, \"... something that is definitely not created by our Department of Defense,\", meaning that what she saw was not only piloted by American pilots, but that they admitted that the craft they were flying was not of DoD manufacture.\n\nThis seems like a very soft, inadvertent, admission that American pilots are piloting \"alien\" aircraft.  \"Alien\" being anything not currently know to our civil leaders nor to our military leaders/pilots.\n\nBasically, some foreign intelligence is probing our world and occasionally f\\*\\*ks up and leaves some of their technology behind.  But the stuff left behind is so incredibly complex and sophisticated we can barely understand how to use it, much less understand how it does what it does.\n\nKind of easy to understand why they are reluctant to say anything.  Basically means the people leading and protecting us are not up to the task at hand.  Disclosure will only begin the en masse discussion:  What the F\\*\\*k are these things and why the F\\*\\*K are they here?\n\nWhat's scary is no one really has an answer.  Human being's have never really lived without some type of social moorings be it religious or whatever.  This is going to create an ideological wormhole sucking up discussions of meaning, purpose, life after death, yadda, yadda.  And as they always do, some jamoke is going to promote a quasi-religious or quasi-satanic narrative to quell the fear of not being able to answer that seemingly basic question: What the F\\*\\*k are these things and why the F\\*\\*K are they here?\n\nI think alien disclosure is going to make the world a VERY weird place to live in.  In an information vacuum, everyone will pick their OWN answers to that question.  I think the powers that be worry about that the most.\n\nSort of like a parent shielding their children from the truth of the \"Real\" world.  The reality is some kids handle it well.  Some don't.  Will be interesting to see which countries/people are able to meet this thing, whatever it is, on it's terms.  Because whatever this thing is, it is going to make us deal with it on It's terms, not ours.",

That's kinda cool.\n\nLas-rifles are something we don't even have ourselves (I think...DARPA is pretty good at what they do), but were extrapolated by GW and every other sci-fi universe ever devised, but that concept goes back a bit in our literature.\n\nGPS guidance is the biggest real advancement in militaries we've had in quite a long time. The value of that kind of coordination capability, accuracy and precision increases by orders of magnitude, is just overwhelming. And it's really not all that hard to do once you know how the system works with what you have to build a system with, basically. It's the whole kit. Optics, lasers, advanced computation, communications, RAM/ROM/EEPROM, force multiplication (like MIRVs or cluster bombs)\n\nPlus the atomic clock. And the information networks. Computers.

Tanks, artillery, fire support, anti-air, etc. \n\nThey even use stuff we've chucked off as being kinda dumb (like shields, lances and a host of unwieldy polearm ) but actually have their value as a weapon and as armor for big crowd suppression and breach assaults. Your average troop doesn't carry one of those around these days.

The guard have it right and so did firstborn tactical squads, but as much as I love the primaris, it makes no sense to have squads entirely comprised of plasma weapons, flamers, or rocket launchers. Typical heavy weapons (like tactical squads) are assigned to a couple guys who become weapon specialists. A hellblaster squad is an entire team full of specialists, and is overkill. Like, say you have 100 miles of terrain to fight over... And there are two armoured companies attacking at either end, and you only have a single squad of hellblasters... They can't cover that ground quickly enough. They can blow one unit to smithereens, but strategically you've just put all your eggs in one basket and lost one of your flanks. The primaris are supposed to be flexible and modular, but their squads are too rigid and unvaried. It makes more sense to have multiple tactical squads across the line with around 2 plasma specialists to counter any enemy armour. \n\nI'll never be able to hold my contempt at how stupid infernus squads are with such short range. It should have been a kit allowing intercessor squads to have a flamer in the squad. \n\nMoreover, the space marine hierarchy is *too* simple. Scout, brother, sergeant, lieutenant, captain, master. Easy right? No corporal or 2IC of a squad. I've had this question answered with \"well the second-most experienced takes over the second squad\" which I say is far too arbitrary. Lieutenant is a step in the right direction, but I've started putting \"2nd sergeants\" in my squads if I ever want to split them. The primary sergeant has gold skulls, and the corporal has silver skulls. It makes no sense to allow a squad to be split up, but not allow the second squad leader any tactical insight to sensitive information that a regular sergeant would be privvy to.",

For example a tank regiment focuses purely on the name sake but the rest of the army would more typically conform to 2-5 battalions organized in brigades. With 2-4 brigades composing a division and a few divisions as an army.  How many regiments compose a larger grouping and what's that grouping called?

For comparison, in our real world, AP and APHE have all been obsolete anti-tank munitions for nearly 70 years now. \n\nTwo: The Imperiums most popular tank , the Lemun Russ, is a tank based on designs that have been obsolete in our real world for more than 75 years. By WWII standards, the Lemus Russ' blueprint would be considered wildly obsolete by 1941. \n\nThree: The Imperium doesn't use any kind of drone tech to bolster their forces. Yes, the Imperium utilizes servitors and servo skulls. Buy both require a literal human brain to function. Aka, servitors and servo skulls are not drones, they're cyborgs. While a Cyborg is significantly more advanced than a drone, the U.S. Predator drone program and the War in Ukraine have both shown the world just how devastating drones can be.\n\nFour: A significant chunk of Gaurdsmen don't use anything other than basic iron sights to line up their shots. By stark contrast, you can't find any modern military unit that isn't fielding basic red dot sights to at least half the soldiers in a traditional infantry regiment.\n\nFive: The Guard uses towed artillery and anti-personel weapons.\n\nSix: Bayonet charges/cavalry charges are employed as a viable battle tactic. \n\nSeven: Basic first-aid materials such as bandaids, tourniquets, and a single shot of morphine aren't carried by all Gaurdsmen in infantry regiments. By contrast, all US soldiers in WWII all had a basic tourniquet on them at all time. \n\nEight: Air burst and timed artillery shells don't appear to be a thing the Guard uses. So all artillery shells impact the ground instead of blowing up over the heads of the enemies, increasing the shells blast radius and lethality.\n\nNine: Wood is still a common material used to hold a weapon together. The US hasn't used wooden furniture on any standard service rifle in over 50 years. \n\nAnd Ten: Trench warfare is a very common tactic used by both the Guard and Space Marines. That's simply unreal since that particular battle tactic was rendered completely obsolete the moment the Nazis drove around the Magot Line, and when air-burst/timed munitions began to see action.",

Relative to what a soldier carries, but significantly less compared to a tank. \n\nIn video game terms they\u2019re like the heavy weapons guy who also provides a speed buff for long distance travel.\n\nThe American Bradley in particular has a wire guided TOW missile as standard. This is comparable to the hunter seeker missile. So Rhinos with hunter seekers are sort of like IFVs, but they\u2019d need to have something more like a heavy bolter, auto cannon or similar to be an IFV equivalent.\n\nEDIT: I completely forgot about Razorbacks.

Years of data, pattern recognition, and predictive marketing designed to catch you at a point when you are most likely to commit to a product. I suspect the data collection is much more invasive than any of us realize.",

                "Ive occ had a similar thought.\n\nThe less crazy possible answer is that the random stimuli that made you happen to think about the game are the same stimuli that the algorithm picked up on.\n\nIt's like the old-school internet story about the person who got pissed about all the pregnancy advertising that they had suddenly started receiving, only to find out a few weeks later that they *were* pregnant. Supposedly the algorithm had worked it out from food purchases they'd made recently.",
                "I'll tell you something crazy but honestly, I doubt many of you will believe my words. You wanna keep your sanity then I'd suggest to just pretend I took to many crazy pills and brush these thoughts out of your mind, this is some psyche ward level thinking.\n\nAnyway you've been warned I'll continue, when I did acid with my friends we took a lot of acid, like somewhere in the 400ug to 500ug range. This is well above any normal dose and is generally reserved for when you're a zombie on the couch tripping alone with a trip sitter. (also lowkey giving yourself brain damage don't do this much acid ever)\n\nI always noticed the cats would react to my thoughts when I would do acid by myself but I never really thought about it much. Anyway when I was with my two friends I thought to myself I might as well see if my friends would react to my mind's voice.\n\nWell it did work, to the point where we all became aware of each others thoughts, mainly my thoughts since I was the most vocal with my mind. It basically came to the point where I found it extremely hard to communicate by speaking at the end of the night I could only talk with my mind.\n\nAfter I realised this and sobered up, I've noticed everyone can hear your thoughts they are just not consciously aware. Like their body language will actively tell you. If you think about telling them something they don't want to hear, they will cut you off before you even ask it. It gets even crazier than that. If someone is talking to you and your mind's voice in your head goes off and starts talking watch the person lose their train of thought. I'm not even fuckin' kidding I've seen it so much that I cannot deny this fact.\n\nYawning? What's yawning for? It floods your body with dopamine and makes you forget about your train of thought. Your friend says some weird thing you take negatively? Instead of thinking negatively watch your body just yawn that thought away. I have also experienced this way too many times for it to be coincidental .\n\nAgain you'll be on the crazy train if you believe this stuff and it took me ages to come to terms that people aren't consciously aware of your thoughts. But believe me, yes your mind is easily able to be read. We could talk to each other from across the room, I've only tested it to about 3-4 meters but damn it's some absolute crazy shit.\n\nNow for the sciencey part. Microphones record from 0-20000hz aka yes they should be able to pick up your brain waves in the 0-80hz(?) range easily. Now here's for my bootleg theory of how it is even possible for people to hear each other. Our ears only hear 20-20000hz (to my knowledge). When you are tripping balls, fight or flight or just sexually in the mood. When you are in the Beta (12\u201335 Hz) and Gamma (35+ Hz) zone for your brain. Yes your brain waves should be able to be picked up by people around you even if they are not consciously aware.\n\nI believe this is why people want to have sex with you it's very easily noticeable, it's also the same reason why you know when somone is about to punch you, you can sense what is about to unfold. It's absolutely crazy to think about all this, so my recommendation is just to ignore it and pretend like you don't know. BUT be warned, once you know, YOU KNOW.",

He was talking about Apple saving all athletics footage immediately and allowing fans, recruiters, etc. the ability to access it via Apple TV. To be clear I\u2019m not saying the PAC-12 schools should have signed a deal with Apple because of this but it would be nice if current media partners incorporate this idea. \n\nI understand any media company can offer this, but *do* they currently for football/basketball games? Can I login to ESPN+ and watch a college football game that was broadcast last season? I tried and only big games like the National Championship seem to be available. Additionally, with multiple media partners you would have to login to different services to find different games even within the same conference. \n\nIf Apple was willing to pay the $20 million, plus cataloguing and storing footage there is *some* value in that.\nI know YouTube TV allows you to record all games from a conference but you have to set it up before they air. What happens if you cancel the subscription and come back? Do you lose the recordings? There is a convenience to a single company like Apple just saving and making all games streamable to everyone using the service.\n\nThere may not be a lot of demand for this but personally it would be valuable to me. I\u2019d love to rewatch ASU beating UA 70-7 by just logging into a streaming service. I had it saved on my DVR but it died and was replaced.\n\n-Michael Crow.",

                "I think there's a way to do \"just plug in\" charging that isn't \"make an EA account, make a Tesla account, make a chargepoint account, etc\", but it's largely a false choice as noted. \n\nI don't know why anyone would argue about the \"eventually resemble gas stations\" point. The best stops IMO are already gas stations. I want to get right off the highway to a place with a bathroom I know will be open. I don't give a rip about \"something to do\". The car is done before we are half the time, and the other half the time it's a \"who gives a shit\" amount of time remaining where just taking a bit to get settled and set up to continue on is most of the rest of the time. (ie, if you unplug, then wrangle the drinks into the car and into the cup holder, get the kids/pets buckled/settled, arrange this and that, etc...or do all that, THEN unplug...did you even \"wait\" that extra 5 minutes?)",
                "I really enjoyed this video. I don't agree with him on Plug and Charge (no card needed) since it does speed up the process and allows a driver to spend way less time outside their car on a hot or cold day where there are no canopies. I'm glad he's coming around on NACS since it is the better plug and the Superchargers put other charging stations to shame. Hyundai and Kia still haven't committed to NACS because their cars would need to trickle charge on a Tesla Supercharger that doesn't support 800v batteries. Imagine getting 35 to 40 kW max on a supercharger.",
                "One thought about why autocharge or plug and charge is a good idea that should have been mentioned is because the chargers are outside in the elements, the less time one is out in the elements especially in pouring down rain or extreme cold the better.  Every seconds matter.  This is even true with gas stations if you\u2019ve ever gotten gas in a heavy rainstorm where the canopy or covering didn\u2019t quiet shield you from all the rain.",
                "He's absolutely right on the payment terminal.  This is a problem thats been solved decades ago.  If someone borrows my Tesla, and they supercharge guess whos paying for it?  Me.  If someone borrows my F-350 and puts diesel in it, guess whos paying for it?  Them, with their payment card.   \n\n\nI love the ease of use of Superchargers, but there really does need to be a payment solution for using payment cards, or cash.  The older I get the more I prefer to just use cash for everything and not cards.",
                "There's an irony to saying that the single biggest problem with the non-Tesla EV charging network is getting the charge started and then saying that you don't support plug-and-charge.\n\nThere is an opportunity to implement a standardized way to pay to fill up your car without giving x% to credit card companies.",
                "Sounds like his real point with plug-and-charge is that it\u2019s great if you have a regular/consistent relationship with the charge provider (like if you do your L2 charging at a consistent place), but if a real ecosystem of competing fast-charge providers develops, the \u201cgas station\u201d payment model would give a more-consistent experience as you hit different types of stations along your trip.\n\nIn any case, I\u2019d just like to point out that, in sightings of V4 supercharger equipment, the charging stands appear to include a small screen, so they may well accept credit cards / contactless payments once they\u2019re fully deployed & open.",
                "Does NACS support vehicle to grid? Or an adapter where I can essentially power my cabin / trailer through the charge plug. Without that I feel like the standard still isn\u2019t a comprehensive solution.",
                "I give Alec a lot of credit for his humility. I disagree - I think plug and charge solves a problem - a minor one. Not all solves have to be massive. \n\nBut sure - why not add a tap and pay?",

                "I\u2019m not American so don\u2019t really have a horse in the race, given *neither* CCS1 nor NACS are a thing anywhere else in the world. I just think it\u2019s a shame that *yet again*, America has to be the odd one out. In so many fields, there\u2019s basically \u201ca global standard\u201d, and then \u201cthe one that America uses\u201d. Although in this case Canada is going along for the ride too.\n\nLike, I get that three phase power isn\u2019t a thing in the US (in homes at least), but really, why does the US always have to be different?\n\nHe\u2019s correct that the issue with non-Tesla chargers is not the fault of the port. After all, over here in CCS2 land, all chargers *including Tesla superchargers* are CCS2, but the supercharger network is still more reliable than the others. It comes down to support: rapid identification and repair of faults.\n\nAlso I definitely like plug to charge - he\u2019s technically correct that you don\u2019t *need* it, but it sure is nice not having to fumble around with a wallet or phone each time you charge. Agree though that chargers should just have a simple credit card reader as a second option though, as opposed to signing up to an app etc. Who wants to dedicate half a page of app icons on their phone to various charging apps??",

                "There was a book about 35 years ago called Chaos by James Gleick that explains it well.   Weather systems demonstrate a classic feature of chaotic systems: sensitive dependence on initial conditions.  What that means is that tiny variations in the initial conditions can greatly change the outcomes over time.  This is commonly referred to as the butterfly effect.   The butterfly effect is derived from the metaphorical example of the details of a tornado (the exact time of formation, the exact path taken) being influenced by minor perturbations such as a distant butterfly flapping its wings several weeks earlier.\n\nThe problem with chaotic systems is that they are so sensitive to tiny changes in initial conditions that making predictive models becomes extremely difficult.  They are difficult because they become less \n and less accurate when you attempt to simplify them.  All models are by definition simplifications of real world system. You must simplify them because your datasets don't contain everything weather systems react to and you can't factor in all the tiny seemingly insignificant variables that affect outcomes.\n\nThis idea of chaotic systems does have some somewhat stunning implications.  For example, it's easier to predict where mars will be relative to the Earth and Sun in 100 years than the exact path a single rain drop will take as runs down a pane of glass.",
                "Because unless you have the technology to fully and completely simulate the *entire world and everyone/everything in it*, it's functionally impossible to accurately predict the weather something like a few months into the future.\n\nThis is because weather is something called a \"chaotic system\", or colloquially called \"the butterfly effect\", where every tiny gust of wind bumps into every other tiny gust of wind, which keep bumping into each other, over and over, eventually reaching a point where you can't say much about where the air is moving. So if you missed one tiny gust of wind in your calculation, one eddy current off an airplane, even something as small as the wingbeat of a butterfly, (this is why it's called the butterfly effect) then you'll lose accuracy on your prediction within a month or two.",
                "Because weather is chaotic (in a mathematical sense).\n\nIn a well behaved system, if you change the inputs a little bit, the outputs also change a little bit. Think about bouncing a ball. If you drop the ball onto a flat surface from one height, then drop it from a slightly different height, it\u2019s going to do roughly the same thing. It\u2019s going to bounce back up, almost but not quite to the height you dropped it from. If you drop it a few inches to the right or left, it\u2019s going to do basically the same thing. A tiny change in how or where you bounce the ball isn\u2019t going to make a huge change to the outcome. You can pretty easily bounce and catch the ball.\n\nWeather does not do this. It\u2019s more like dropping a ball onto an uneven surface, with bumps and dips in an irregular pattern. If you drop it in one place, the ball will bounce straight up, but if you drop it just a little way away, where the floor is angled in a different direction, it\u2019s going to go off in a totally different direction. Bouncing and catching the ball is going to be a lot harder in this scenario.\n\nTo catch a ball, you need to predict where it\u2019s going to go. That\u2019s hard if you\u2019re bouncing the ball on an irregular surface. The irregular surface is going to make small changes in where you drop the ball into big changes in where it ends up. Weather is like this- small changes get magnified into big changes, in a way that\u2019s hard to predict. You would need extremely precise measurements of all the variables like temperature, air pressure, humidity, and so on to predict what it\u2019s going to do tomorrow. If you get your measurements wrong by a tiny bit (and remember, no measurement can be perfect), you can be way off in your prediction of what\u2019s going to happen.",
                "ELI5: It's too much information and needs to be processed too quickly.We barely understand all the forces at play in pouring out a bucket of water.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome guesstimates on the numbers involved......\n\nIn air, we have density, humidity, charge, speed, direction (in 3D), temperature, etc.I've listed 8 numbers there.It is further impacted by sun activity, moon, tides, surface materials etc.Then we have to measure that every hour.  Or every minute?\n\nIt's no good calculating these things 1km apart.  In 1km, the air is going in different directions at different speeds and temperatures.  The more detail the better so let's measure every metre.\n\nSo for 1 cubic kilometre of measurements, we have 1000m x 1000m x 1000m x 8 measures x 60 times per hour.  That is 480,000,000,000 numbers for 1 cubic meter of air for 1 hour.\n\nSo a town of 5km x 5km, and measuring 10km up, we have 5000 x 5000 x 10000 x 8 x 60.120,000,000,000,000 of numbers in 1 hour.\n\nTo cover a day, that is 2,880,000,000,000,000 numbers (2880 Trillion).\n\nTo cover the USA that is approx 50,350,080,000,000,000,000. For 1 hour.\n\nFor 1 day, 1,208,401,920,000,000,000,000 numbers.  1.2 Billion Trillion.\n\nNow calculate the interactions of these numbers for 7 days.\n\nAnd add in the impact of the ground shape with mountains and buildings.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo be really accurate we should calculate every 0.5m but that is 8 times the data.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis doesn't even mention the complexity of HOW we calculate the interactions of the air. That in itself is not ELI5.",
                "The weather models use non-linear partial differential equations. This leads to a host of problems. First of all, they are really sensitive to initial conditions. Secondly, we only have so many places taking measurements as input, but in theory we would need an infinite number of measurements. Thirdly, most have no closed form solution, so you to grind through them one little bit of volume at a time. So computationally, they are expensive.\n\nPlus, some of the behavior is chaotic, meaning that small changes in inputs can have really large changes in outputs. \n\nBottom line, modeling the weather is a very difficult problem, both theoretically, and practically.",
                "Imagine you have a box of 500 straws. You throw them high up in the air and they fall all over the floor. What chances did you have to predict exactly where and how each straw would land?    \n      \nThat is what a chaotic system is. Slight variations in input can create near random variations in output.",
                "I think a good ELI5 answer is that weather is really complicated and depends on a lot of different factors. Temperature, air pressure, wind, humidity etc. etc. etc. Getting precision measurement of all these factors from many different places is hard. But we can do it really really well.\n\nIf we just replace the whole thing with just a number we can predict the weather with really high precision, 5 decimal places!\n\nSo we can predict the weather to be: 56.45381\n\nBut the problem is that the weather is \"chaotic\", meaning that even the slightest change can make a huge difference.\n\nThe difference between 56.45381**3** and 56.45381**5** can be thick grey clouds and rain or sparse light clouds and mostly sunshine.\n\nThe tiniest variables can make a huge difference. And we simply can't gather enough data or calculate it precisely enough to make better predictions.",
                "To know the weather in the future you need two things: what is the weather now, and how does the weather change over time. \n\nMeasurements of anything, including the weather, always have small errors. Your parents may have measured your height with a giant ruler while you were growing up, and there are lines on the ruler that say how tall you are. There are gaps between the lines and if your height is there, the ruler doesn't give you an exact answer. Also, what if you were standing on your toes a bit. The same thing happens when we measure where all the clouds are, or what direction the wind is currently blowing, we will get small errors. These measurement errors turn into weather prediction errors.\n\nWeather is the motion of a bunch of fluids through each other. People have models to predict how fluids will move, but fluids are very chaotic and can easily change. There are very accurate mathematical models that predict the motion of fluids. They aren't perfect, so some model error turns into weather prediction error.",
                "There are many great answers here, I just wanted to show what does a \"chaotic system\" mean. A [double pendulum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_pendulum) is probably the simplest chaotic system.\n\n[Here](https://youtube.com/watch?v=-Fo4ZZfvcTE) is the visualisation of 1,000,000 identical double pendulums released from the same position with very slight variations - about one billionth (10^-9 ) of the circle between the two adjacent ones. Notice how wildly do they deviate after only a couple of rotations. The weather on Earth exhibits the same behaviour but on a larger scale. No matter how precise our measurements are, we will always be some pendulums away from the \"real\" position, so our calculations will start to deviate from the actual weather after a while.",
                "Basically, some things (even some very simple things) are \"chaotic\" - they can behave vastly differently over time if their starting conditions are changed by even the *tiniest* amount. That makes them inherently unpredictable. And weather is one of them.\n\nHere's [a computer model of three double pendulums](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjZd-AvPco). They start within a degree of each other, but just 20 seconds in they're starting to do very different things. If you build an actual double pendulum, and try to make it do the same things repeatedly by starting it \"in the same position\" each time - you'll fail, simple as that.\n\n(Don't fall into the trap of thinking that, well, it's just a question of getting the start positions \"close enough\". It's tempting to think that, but it's not true. Chaotic systems simply don't work like that. Make THE smallest change you can conceive of to a chaotic system, and it is perfectly capable of behaving radically differently.)\n\nHere's [a TED video of another chaotic system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFdZ9t4Y5hQ), this time a (real) pendulum and magnets.\n\nThose are *really* simple things. The weather, by contrast, is huge and massively complex. And it, too, is chaotic. To predict it perfectly, we'd have to have full, perfectly accurate data on every last thing that comprises it - every molecule of air, every photon arriving from the sun, whether or not you choose to slightly stir the air around you by scratching that itch on your nose...). Oh, and a perfect model of how it all fits together, of course. We have neither. What should actually be astonishing is just how well we manage to do with the very limited amount of actual data we gather.",

Simple systems have few variables and we know how they are related but with the atmosphere it is almost impossible. It is known as a chaotic system, a very little variation in the initial states of the variables that we know can change completely the prediction. As you can see we can measure the weather quite well in a 3-5 day range but further than that is almost completely random. Guessing the next 2 month weather and trying to calculate have the same probabilites to be right (or wrong).\n\nTake a look at this video that explains chaotic systems:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDeN3iCtyNY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDeN3iCtyNY)",

                "Our technologies are always grounded in a mathematical understanding of the natural laws around us. In physics we have equations to accurately describe a great many natural phenoma like electricity, gravity, kinematics, quantum mechanics, etc. \n\n\nThe trouble with weather is that to accurately model it, you would have to be accounting for billions upon billions of particles in the air of all different shapes and sizes, and all of their interactions with the surface of the earth and each other. To do so with conventional physics is obviously impractical and probably will never be practical, it's just too much processing power required. \n\nWe do have equations that give us approximations for how fluids behave over large areas which we can use to generally describe things like weather patterns, but it's never going to be an exact science using these methods. As a result, we are left with very short term forecasts that are oft changing, giving the appearance that we don't know how to predict the weather. \n\nIt's not that we don't, it's that it's literally impossible to do it perfectly",
                "because you only have limited precision. now, don't get me wrong, modern computer systems can have very high, even arbitrary precision arithmetic. but in practice, colloquially speaking, you only simulate with numbers that have a fixed-size representation, and therefore a fixed maximum precision. in a chaotic system like the global weather system even the smallest imperfections will quickly escalate into major computation inaccuracies to the point where eventually you can't be confident in the results anymore. if you want to understand just how massive such an effect can be look up double-pendulum simulations online as an example for a very simple, highly chaotic system. watch how the smallest deviation from the start configuration is quickly amplified into behaviour that has absolutely no resemblance to the original behaviour. and now think about the infinite and complex interactions of the weather system on a global scale",

You can generally predict that the hot water will rise and the cold water will fall, but the exact locations are different every time. \n\nLet\u2019s say that there\u2019s an ant at the bottom of the bowl.

There are a bunch of areas of varying pressures, densities, humidities, and temperatures, all interacting with each other. There are extremely powerful supercomputers who are constantly fed data from weather centers, airports, and weather balloons from all around the world, but because of the complexity of the system, even the computers can\u2019t agree (think of the \u201cspaghetti plots\u201d you see in hurricane predictions) \n\nWe\u2019re all like tiny ants, in a bowl with 50 different kinds of food coloring, at 50 different temperatures, that\u2019s spinning, and we want to know whether or not the conditions are perfect to make water droplets form in mid-air and fall from the sky.",

                "Imagine you have a series of swimming pools filled with water to that sum to 1.3 billion km^2 in surface area - 2/3rds the size of the globe. They are covered by a series of air pockets the size of the globe. The swimming pools are constantly emptying humidity into the air pockets, and then the air pockets are dumping the water out of the pool or into a different pool. This is happening in billions of square km all over the globe, more than 2/3rds of which is water. Every time it happens, the heat content and humidity of each square km changes, and it's changing non-stop.\n\nSo if you want a resolution of 1 square km, you have to track ~2 billion data points *just on the surface*. And the pockets of air are many kilometers deep, so really, you have 10s of billions of data points - one for each cubic km. And they're changing non-stop. And they're interacting with one another non-stop. Let's say we want to have predictions that are accurate to the hour interval, and assume that only 10 km of atmosphere are relevant to the weather. We're now on the order of 250 billion data points, on an hourly, cubic km resolution.\n\nSo a weather model at that resolution is required to have 250 billion sensors all over the globe, all networked and feeding information back to a central data repository. But that's too costly. Plus people in other countries would feel kinda weird about being observed that closely, so we have to make due with a much smaller number of sensors, which are trying to interpolate (figure out in-between points), often from high altitudes/space. So we use that smaller number of data points to create models about what we'd expect to be there in between, and use that incomplete data model to make predictions about what will happen, in terms of weather. And that means there's a lot more error than there might be with perfect data.",

And if you don't believe me than you're being quite draconian about it.\n\nBasilisk in Latin means King of the Serpents, as in St Peters Basilica where there lies two Dragon Statues in the Vatican as well as Obelisks, the phallus of the Dragon that is why there is at least few obelisks in every city on the planet the Freemasons put them there throughout history in order to control consciousness...The Chinese, Japanese, India,  Indonesians, Mayans, Aztecs, Incas all worship the Dragon in antiquity...

In the Aegean Sea there are 13 ancient Megalithic sites that represent the 13 Illuminati Families that control the world, that when you connect them dot to dot, over 1000km area makes a perfect Maltese Cross. This is the symbol of the Monarchy, Freemasonry, Vatican, Jesuits, Knights of Malta and Templars, even Hitler's Germany. Megalithic architecture on geomantic energy sites, in conjunction with an occult esoteric satanic Freemasonry religion of Kabbhalism, aka the Lucifer experiment in order to control humanities consciousness and why there is an obelisk in every major city on the planet... The pyramids also create dimensional portals into Agartha/Hollow Earth, hence disappearance of boats, planes in the Bermuda Triangle and Dragon's Triangle...\n\nhttp://chani.invisionzone.com/uploads/monthly_08_2013/post-248-0-56239100-1376895880.jpg.\n\nDragons see humanity as a resource for the simple fact that they are not vegetarians! 1 million people disappear in the United States every single year. 8 million children globally disappear annually off the globe.\n\nThe Legend Of Atlantis\nhttps://youtu.be/pihxOs-pVRA\n\n\nSecrets Of The 3rd Reich Secret Nazi Research in Alien Technology\nhttps://youtu.be/B0uEvZsQAV8\n\nNephilim: TRUE STORY of Satan, Fallen Angels, Giants, Aliens, Hybrids, Elongated Skulls & Nephilim\nhttps://youtu.be/1zz8_MxcnzY\n\nIf none of the links are active go to my YouTube channel",

We can't be mindless consumers anymore. Our society is structured completely wrong. \n\nThe reality is there isn't a solution the majority is ever going to agree on and well run this ship right into the ground. This should have been mainstream news 20-30 years ago and anytime a politican comes around that actually focuses on the climate, arguably the **only** thing that matters right now, the people either don't vote for them or they get screwed by corruption.",
                "This view sets up a false dichotomy. The most viable option to address climate change is significant government regulation on industry to change production-side emissions and fossil fuel production. This is not an incremental change to our way of life (since it has little to do with lifestyle) nor does it involve a technological breakthrough.",
                "I think what you are suggesting is ultimately 'sciencing our way out of climate change' and this is unlikely to work because we are running out of time.\n\nScientific breakthroughs will happen, there is no doubt about it. However, it may take years to test, optimise, commercialise, and implement new technologies and solutions. It took almost a century for modern solar and wind technologies to mature: Both initially appeared at the end of the 19th century (1880s).\n\nThe first breakthrough in nuclear fusion happened last year in December. It was a 5s experiment that produced a tiny bit of surplus energy. When the fusion technology is ready for commercialisation/widespread use, climate change will be irreversible and impossible to mitigate if we continue business-as-usual and hope to solve everything with nuclear fusion.\n\nThere were zero experiments on changing the Earth's albedo (your glitter in the troposphere) and no one knows or can predict with a high degree of certainty what will happen even in the short term. I am not sure it is a good idea to hope for the best and just roll the dice.\n\nCO2 capture and storage (CCS) is currently commercially unviable and requires changes in regulations to become viable. There are also concerns about possible leaks. CCS would also require large investments in its infrastructure (scrubbers, pipes, storage, etc.). Most importantly, this technology does not address the source of the problem, it only deals with the symptoms and can potentially promote further increases in CO2 emissions.\n\nAs for small changes in consumer behaviours, I think they will not work, too. They are too small.\n\nMost scientific papers I read suggest that the best way (if not the only way) to mitigate climate change (at this point no one talks about reversing it) is through swift and radical changes in regulations. Governments need to take action because only they have the power to force changes on a global scale.\n\nEDIT: u/HughJazzKok in the comments points out that the nuclear fusion experiment resulted in some excess energy, but the net energy in the entire system is not surplus. If it is the case (I am not a physicist and have to rely on newspaper reporting), we are even further from the practical implementation than I originally thought.",
                ">Seriously, does anyone actually think this will fix things?\n\nYes.\n\n>I mean to say that small changes to be more environmentally friendly such as buying a hybrid vehicle or eating less meat are next to useless.\n\nElectric vehicles themselves don't change anything. In combination with solar and wind energy this story changes, though. Both, EVs and renewable energies have seen steady marginal growth. It'd ease my mind if the growth was more vigorous, but it is growing and improving at least and it creates an economical alternative to the current status quo thats fossil energy. Technological change in history always followed this slow marginal growth pattern, as well. The industrial revolution took hundreds of years and we still saw the highest amounts of growth in the last decades, meaning it isn't done yet.\n\nIf anything, its exactly the reluctance to embrace this -marginal but hard- path, which you show here in your approach that is very common among most people, which seriously holds politics back from more quickly phasing out environmentally harmful technologies. Because, what if some technology comes around the corner that makes driving cars ok, again? Then all this change was for nothing, right?\n\nWell, historically speaking at least, nothing like this has ever happened. The real difficulty in quickly changing the world lies in quickly changing humans, which is impossible. Case in point, we have two incredibly efficient means of transportation that have actually been phased out of use in the last 70 years: The bike and the train. Humans are super efficient when it comes to movement and putting a human on a bike on a road is litteral efficiency heaven, nothing compares. Conversely, if you do want to go faster than by bike, and boats are still too slow for you, then the next most efficient mode is the train, since it leverages the efficiencies that come from moving many people at once and it takes advantage of most people traveling between the same places anyway. So here is my question back to you, why isn't the western world filled to the brim with these two killer technologies which are clearly superior to car and plane in the majority of cases and which go a long way in stopping climate change?",
                "There is a fallacy here, right. You consider small incremental behaviour changes but transformative tech. \n\nWhat is needed are systemic transformations in our economic structures. Big changes in our way of life.\n\nFrom throwing stuff away, we need a circular economy.\n\nHybrid cars etc aren't a sufficient climate solution. But public transit is. \n\nEating vegetarian (not just a bit less meat) is vital to free up land for ecosystem restoration and tree planting. \n\nEtc.",

Do you have any evidence to back up your views?\n\n[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/20/vegan-diet-cuts-environmental-damage-climate-heating-emissions-study](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/20/vegan-diet-cuts-environmental-damage-climate-heating-emissions-study)",

The idea that some brilliant breakthrough in tech will save us is a dream of people who don't want any solution that challenges the status quo. For example a ban on ICE vehicles and a reduction in the number personal vehicles on the road is something that is almost definitely necessary to reduce our emissions, but people really hate the idea of losing their gas guzzling truck so they are attracted to a future where they can keep living exactly as they are but the clouds are sparkly or whatever.",
                "All the \"fantastic technological breakthroughs\" are just bandaids that only delay the issue instead of solving it (while also encouraging the same kind of emissions that caused the problem).   \nThe real way to solve climate change is to just stop consuming 60%-70% of our energy demand. Except that would pretty much end all cars, butcher industry and agriculture, make consumer goods obscenely expensive, e.t.c. And no country would agree to subject itself to that, much less the entire world.  \nI believe we will not solve global warming. Billions will be displaced and die in the next century or two. Human civilization will massively shrink. And then maybe their emissions will be small enough so they can actually solve it without waiting for millions of years of natural processes.",

                ">In regards to the former, I mean to say that small changes to be more environmentally friendly such as buying a hybrid vehicle or eating less meat are next to useless. Seriously, does anyone actually think this will fix things?\n\nOf course it's what solves the issue, because that is what is always solving the issues - small, piecemeal, incremental changes to our way of life that prompt more study into these avenues, more small, piecemeal, incremental technological changes - all of that will add up into an actual breakthrough. Breakthrough that will not be a one big tech that solves the problem, but a plethora of small changes and techs that would solve the issue.\n\nIf you buy a hybrid vehicles, there is market for them. So companies need to invest in hybrids/EV and tech around it to make a more compelling hybrid/EV for people to buy. This leads to R&D funding and more incremental changes - until you come to a point where electric motor and batteries are good enough to power ANY vehicle. At that market pursuing selling EV cars made enough tech changes that  electric motor can be used in major polluters - electric trucks, electric ships, electric planes. And they will be powered by renewable energy as competition in that sector is doing the same - making costs og generating energy lower and lower. \n\n>And by \u2018big technological breakthrough\u2019 I mean something along the lines of blasting glitter into the troposphere to block out the sun or using fusion power to scrub carbon out of the air to later be buried underground. We are the human race and we\u2019re nothing if not flexible and adaptable when push comes to shove.\n\nYou know that in human history issues were rarely, if ever, resolved by a big technological breakthrough. They were solved by someone inventing new way of doing X that was less capable but promising, people investing into it and tech slowly getting better and better until old way that was problematic was dropped because it was obsolete.\n\nCan you name any issue that was resolved by sudden breakthrough?",

But if thousands or millions stop using their products? Well that will kill these industries and pollution with them. This is \"my vote doesn't matter\" debate but it always does.",
                "It will cost far less money and diplomatic issues to just convert to a carbon neutral global economy than to moonshot some untested new toy to screw with the climate in some new way. Not to mention that that expensive toy will not sustainably solve the problem, if it solves the problem at all (rather than just creating its own, new problems).\n\nWe have the technology to solve the problem. Ignoring that technology in favour of some imaginary new technology just sounds like a child bored with their toys and wanting a new toy for the novelty. \u2018Technologists\u2019 need to grow up and get on board with the solutions on the table, because we simply do not have the time for this kind of screwing around.",
                "Energy transition expert here...\n\nI suppose it really depends on what you consider a technological breakthrough and what is just incremental improvements to existing technology.\n\nFor electricity, I think the technology is there (or getting there) to use solar and wind with stationary battery storage with some small modular nuclear reactors and peaker natural gas plants to guarantee reliability. Perhaps not 100% decarbonized by close enough.\n\nFor transportation, I think lithium-ion batteries can be used in a lot of lighter vehicle use cases. But I think this is more limited and subject to consumer resistance than what a lot of advocates would tell you. Perhaps each private home in the U.S. will have one BEV and one non-BEV vehicle. That's probably the maximum market penetration we'll see in the U.S. in my opinion.\n\nFor the remaining transportation use cases and for decarbonizing heavy industry and residential and commercial heating, I really think low-carbon hydrogen will be the key source of energy, either in its natural form or as a derivative like ammonia or methanol. Hydrogen costs are tied to renewable power and natural gas costs and there is a TON of investment going on right now to make it competitive vs. diesel and gasoline. And I think it will be by the 2030s.\n\nLastly, we do have pretty serious investment and technology in the realm of carbon capture and electrification of technologies. Maybe direct air capture is a ways off but at least in certain locations that have abundant geothermal energy like in Iceland, they could just keep on sucking CO2 out of the atmosphere indefinitely. But the vast majority of carbon capture will be on concentrated emissions sources at industrial facilities. The technology is there. It just costs money and needs to get past the NIMBYism.",
                "I agree with you on this.  With all the targets we have set globally it's really just lip service in the grand scheme of things.  The countries that matter in Asia and Africa with the largest populations as their wealth increases they want the quality of life we have enjoyed in the west.  They don't really give a rip about climate targets - if we decimate our economy to save the world they are just going to steam roll us and carry on with the status quo!  \n\nThat being said I don't think we should do nothing - it's important to invest and INNOVATE in clean technologies. With AI there is some risk but I think there is a lot of potential when you literally have infinite intelligence.  I don't think we comprehend what that means for humanity.",
                "We're not going to stop the bath from overflowing until we learn how to unstop the drain; that doesn't mean we don't bail out to the sink until we figure it out.\n\nThe path we're on now, we *need* some massive breakthroughs to solve the problem and return to the life we had before. We have to do everything we can to slow the problem so we have enough time to solve the problem.",
                "Agree with first half, second half I don\u2019t. All the technology to help mitigate climate change and become carbon neutral already exists, it\u2019s just a matter of actually deploying it to scale and refining it. Nuclear, wind, solar. The tech necessary to provide energy for our world already exists, and only needs finite tuning and deployment. We are already looking into gene editing a species of poisonous peas by removing the toxic aspect and making it safe for consumption. This particular plant reinvigorates the soil and is extremely resilient. If the poison aspect can be removed, it can easily become a staple food source for the world even if things do go tits up. All the technology to save society and then some already exists, the problem is sociological in nature. It requires some fundamental changes to society and our role on the planet as a whole, as well as some temporary discomfort in the interim as we transition. Oil companies need to be held accountable too, as they knew the risks since the 80s but kept things business as usual despite that, even actively pushing out/funding disinformation (sort of like how the cigarette companies used to do). I don\u2019t think there is any tech breakthrough that could be made that can fix this, it requires getting people, politicians, and businesses all on board unfortunately. I think it can be done, but it definitely isn\u2019t going to be easy",

We made slingshots before we made interplanetary vehicles. We need the economy and support starting with small business startups before we can have the economy and support for a planetary wide cleanup and green energy network.\n\nWe currently have the technology to completely make the planet green and reverse climate change.

This number is based on our current pollution rate.\n\nNo carbon tax will ever pay for that however. The framework is there for success, these small increments every year lower the cost of that by trillions of dollars and gives companies and researchers the money necessary to create the infrastructure and technology required to make this plausible.\n\nIf everyone on earth switched to electric cars, it would be lowered by around 1/3rd.

They don't expose any direct links and rely on viewers ignorance implying cnc machines are somehow rare. \n\nI just read the piece that ngo put out with MarketWatch about Unilever. Unilever still has businesses in Russia. Their argument stems from the taxes raised by Unilever selling goods in Russia. If they stopped selling soap in Russia does this ngo think Russians just won't make or buy soap? Even from an economic perspective do they think letting the Russian state seize assets and the profits of these enterprises provide a better solution than a western company siphoning these after tax profits to western shareholders. Even if they sold the assets off, the company that gets these assets might actually reinvest that money in Russia having a much greater impact on Russia's economic growth. I can understand going after companies even indirectly doing business with the Russian government. But this argument that any economic activity that would contribute to tax revenues is a direct funding of war is completely banal. \n\nThis is just so embarrassing\n\nEdit:formatting",
                "This ridiculous story again. If there was any actual proof last time this came up, the US goverment would have taken action as what they accused Haas of was a serious breach.\n\nAs it turns out there were no proof that Haas didn't immediately stop selling to Russia when the law demanded it. The only proof there was that machines already sold to a distribution company where then sold to Russia after the beginning of the war.\n\nNow we have the same shit all over. They have zero proof that Haas has knowingly sold machine parts to Russia. All they can see is that Haas parts are going into the country. Even though those machines could easily have smuggled in via middle men, come from other machines that have been broken down, etc. Shit that would be impossible for Haas to track or control. \n\nHonestly embarrassing journalism from PBS. I'm hardcore on the side of Ukraine in the conflict, but it feels like there's a journalist here who has just gotten a single source from Ukraine telling him shit and he takes everything as gospel and forgets his job as a journalist.",

                "\u201cHorsepower remained at 160 HP, and some tests even showed a slight fuel economy improvement.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt wasn't 100% perfect, of course \u2014 NOx emissions were still higher than a catalyst-equipped car, but even so, the CVCC V8 was still massively cleaner than most other engines of the era and easily passed the EPA's requirements.\u201d\n\nSo GM saw no benefit to producing more costly and complicated engines that didn\u2019t improve emissions more than catalytic converters, or improve fuel mileage enough to justify the trade off.\n\nGM has a history of bafflingly stupid decisions, but sometimes it\u2019s all up to how you frame it.\n\nSeems to be the CEO recognized that there was no benefit to implementing this design when cats are cheaper, easier to install and more effective in their purpose. \n\nHe didn\u2019t have to be asshole about it, but he wasn\u2019t exactly wrong.",
                "Except regulation soon required catalytic converters anyway, so CVCC without a cat was a dead end.",
                "I would love to see on of those CVCC V8 engines. I heard they existed, but I never even saw a photo of one.",
                "My older sister bought one of the CVCC Civics as her first adult car. There are four things I remember about it:\n\n1. It was yellow!\n2. How proud she was of it and how excited she was to show it off to dad\n3. How tiny it was. Even as a kid I was really tall and I thought it was a fucking clown car when they stuffed me in the back\n4. The CVCC system was a [nightmare of vacuum hoses](https://hips.hearstapps.com/autoweek/assets/s3fs-public/CVCC%2520Vacuum%2520Hell%2520-%25201600x900.jpg?resize=980:*).\n\nCVCC worked and was an impressive bit of engineering but as bad as the emissions bandaids of the day were, waiting for computer controlled EFI with O2 feedback and efficient 3-way cats to be practical at large scale was probably the better way forward. Can you imagine how much worse American cars of the period would have been with an additional 8 miles of vacuum hoses connecting a Rube Goldberg-ian, Audi powertrain engineer's wet dream collection contraptions under the hood? They had enough trouble with the handful of Rube Goldberg emissions contraptions they already had.\n\nIt is a great story though.",

                "The counterpoint to this is that CVCC is a major pain in the ass system that adds soooooo much unnecessary complexity to what are otherwise pretty fantastic engines, and turns tunning early carbureted Hondas into an absolute nightmare. The process for assisting idle on my '79 requires disassembling the carb, and tuning the carb requires a specialized tool that is no longer made.",

                "I used to own a 2006 2.2l i-CTDi Civic - yes there are more powerful engines, yes everyone in the UK has since moved away from diesel, but that engine was an absolute joy. I'd come from a 2003 1.4l petrol Polo and my commute was mostly motorway so it was like stepping into a rocket ship in comparison.",
                "It wasn't a technology with a future, which I'm sure GM was ware of at the time. You'll notice everything uses a catalytic converter.\n\nNote for those interested: The car and bus manufacturers similarly did not dismantle wildly profitable and heavily used trolley systems in order to sell more buses.",
                "In the early 2000s, a young engineer at my company who was taking an engineering course at Cal Berkeley built an engine control system for the diesel version of the Mercedes Smart Car engine.  It passed California EPA emissions in testing without additional controls, and we used it for hybrid boats.",

                "Tbf, the Chevy impala V8 probably produced as much hp as a motorcycle engine",
                "It took the US automakers a little while to catch up on modern overhead cam designs (and the Malaise era is part of the reason why), but they are equally capable of making high-tech combustion engine designs as Japanese or European automakers. \n\nI think it's mostly that when your decisions are largely driven by such a massive domestic market where oil is cheap, you design simple, reliable (and time-tested and improved) products that are more tractor and less motorcycle.",

                "American arrogance  is why the Japanese auto manufacturers became so dominant. It wasn\u2019t until the Japanese started making better trucks that these \u201ccapitalist\u201d cried to the senators to pass some tariffs to help them stay alive.",

Leaks say however that Sam has a vibranium suit (?) so idk. We already saw set photos with Sam with a broken arm.\n\nedit: Only thing I ask is for them to not make Sam look pathetic, elevate him even if he loses that fight.

I think it's quite common that even in sandbox like campaign stuff like doing business by players or participating in politics is often either avoided or largely simplified, because there is just too much potential moving parts to simulate, but with AI assistant, DM can focus on major plotlines and leave Crusader Kings/Victoria stuff simulation to computer.",

This is what I personally presumed happened.\n\nRemember, Calamity Ganon (who we learn in this game was basically just Ganondorf Residue) was able to entirely rend the Kingdom and break all efforts against him by taking over the Divine Beasts and Guardians. Even after it was dealt with, the possibility of another evil taking over their technology would be terrifying.\n\nRemember, the whole deal with Sheikah technology pre BOTW was that it was poorly understood. We skip forwards 100 years and it's better understood but Purah and Robbie are still just testing the limits of a lot of the technologies they have. The danger of their technology being hijacked is greatly heightened by their lack of understanding, they don't even know how Ganon did it.\n\nI could very easily see Zelda issuing a decree to just get rid of it and try to rebuild with their own understanding of the Technology. Hence why we see the Purah Pad seemingly reinventing the wheel from the Sheikah Slate (albeit minus the poorly understood superpowered gadgets) and the Skyview Towers straightforwardly replacing the Lookout Towers.\n\nIdeally if this is the case it should actually be made clear in game, but still, it seems like a fairly obvious explanation to me at least.\n\nEDIT: If people dont shut up about this dumb different timeline theory I stg /j\n\nseriously though I do think it's quite silly.

I also know they could have responded to the sheikah slate being taken out of the terminal in the resurrection room. But I personally like the idea that sheikah technology would activate in response to ganon.\n\nAlso not super active in the subreddit but when I do get on and scroll through I have never seen anyone talk about how the sheikah slate and purah pad could be a chicken and egg kinda of situation. Could the Sheikah have based their technology off of what they would have seen as futuristic technology",
                "The problem with this idea, aside from the lack of any mention of it in the game, is that it means the people of the traumatized and disconnected Hyrule found the time to dismantle over a hundred shrines with massive interiors, four gigantic robots, and hundreds of guardian robots, some of which were still ambulatory and extremely aggressive (though it's unclear if the blood moons were still rezzing them periodically at this point, let's assume not), and didn't use the materials to build any of Hyrule's sorely lacking infrastructure, except for the Skyview towers and random pieces still lying around in Purah and Robbie's labs.",
                "Let\u2019s see here\u2026 it\u2019s been officially confirmed that all the Sheikah Shrines & Towers just went back into the ground, so really all that would be left is the now-deactivated, easily-disassemblable Guardians\u2026 and the Skyview Towers/Purah Pad have to have come from somewhere.",

Same with bosses like taluses being in places that make sense but not exactly the same as the last game. Reusing the assets is fine and super convenient, but that doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t need to change things.\n\nIf you want ad-hoc rationalizations as to why there wouldn\u2019t be much remaining sheikah tech\u2026\n\nThe blood moon presumably stopped happening after calamity gannon was defeated, meaning all of the guardians either powered down or just didn\u2019t resurrect after doing an assisted self destruct courtesy of link. \n\nSo if sheikah tech was a quickly exhausting resource, it would have all been put into things like infrastructure and research equipment now that the fighting had slowed down. We see infrastructure in skyview towers and lookout landing, and we see research equipment in the various laboratories. All being used to aid in a whole new war. (You even see guardian tentacles as part of the launch system of a skyview tower.)\n\nAnd we also get a tidbit that people don\u2019t really understand shiekah tech in the description of ancient blades. So it was either disregarded by the average person, or hoarded by the people who knew what to do with it \n\nBut really yea, just to make totk a new game instead of a dlc. Destructive progression",

I agree it makes complete sense that Zelda would want corruptible weapons to be taken down as quickly as possible, even the old sheikah slate had weapon capabilities.

Hence, the Zonai wage war against Ganondorf, while in BotW the Shiekah had assumed that role (but heavily guided by Zonai technology). This explains why the Zonai ruins start suddenly appearing in the sky despite there being no evidence at all of their existence during BotW. Of course in BotW, the Zonai did not have as much of an active presence and the only evidence of their existence is a few disparate ruins in remote areas and underneath Hyrule castle.",

                "I think a lot of people may be asking because they aren't familiar with the story of BotW, I personally didn't have any interest in the first game because I wasn't a massive fan of Zelda games before and, to me, BotW seemed like a watered down version of Dark Souls. The only time I played BotW before completing TotK was maybe an hour as I bought my switch used and the seller included it. Something I didn't know going in was the early game weapons have significantly less durability than even mid game ones. I remember killing maybe 3 bokoblins with a rusty sword and it broke, which was when I noped out, not knowing you could expand your inventory either, I didn't want to be picking up random weapons all the time just so I could fight. \n\nOver time I saw more videos and heard more about BotW and learned that most of my issues with the game were just early game things that you'd upgrade over time (stamina being one, but also whistle sprinting :) ). Also traversal seemed rough.\n\nBasically people with zero idea how things in the game work, then saw vehicle building and thought \"yea, that'll work\" and went for TotK",
                "It's not a very deep story for a game. Zelda have a James Bond kind of affect. The aren't connected to each other via cannon often. BOTW didn't really have a story so it's easy to ignore stuff that happened in that game.",
                "This is a good in-universe explanation. However, there's nothing mentioned in the game itself.",
                "I was under the impression that by traveling in time princes zelda changed the flow of time, so sheikah technology never happened; it was replased by zonai tech. In the botw timeline zonai were eliminated and their tech did not evilve, being replaced by sheikah tech.",

                "Maybe Zelda, while in the past, influenced the development of Zonai tech in such a way that the BOTW events are no longer the timeline and Link is the only one who knows because he was there when she timejumped and she sent his ass psychic messages in giant hieroglyphs from the past. \n\nI'm sure there are holes in this logic, but why go to the past and do soooo much to help win the second major calamity of this series and not mention the calamity that happened shortly before.",
                "I think Zelda went back and changed the timeline",
                "It is made clear in game: Zelda went to the past, changing it.\nIn botw you has calamity ganondorf (a force of nature), in totk you have demon king Ganondorf.",
                "IMO I think this isn't Botw2, but this is BOTW in a different timeline. One where there was no guardians and Link + races ended up beating Ganon this time around without Sheikah tech.",
                "I like this explanation because it also explains the somewhat plump method of launching Link from a tower. A balloon doesn't require technology. \n\n\nI would also like to add another practical reason: A lot of the dialogue to me felt like the game was supposed to be able to stand on its own. People who haven't played BOTW are supposed to be able to pick it up without feeling like they're missing a huge part of the story. There are a few explanations regarding the past but they probably didn't want to overload the game with stuff that is boring to returning players and confusing to new ones. That would also explain why noone recognizes Link.",
                "Oh wow it\u2019s not explained? Now I wonder what else isn\u2019t explained lol",
                "The thing that confuses me most is the fact that the word Sheikah is mentioned like ONCE if I remember correctly. They even renamed the Sheikah Armor to the Stealth Armor. I understand dismantling the technology, but is there like Sheikah racism now?",
                "I mean\u2026 who cares?",
                "i just believe what my sister says and that the whole idea of the Shekiah being an advvanced group in the BOTW's past was retcon by Nintendo. How would that make TOTK make sense before the Upheval? no idea. But it reallly does seems like a weird retcon.",
                "bigger question: did the totk shrines just appear randomly during the timeskip?",
                "I'm confused as to why they changed the terminology from \"malice\" to \"gloom\". Gloom in this game seems much more potent than Malice was in BotW, yet the word \"gloom\" seems like a weaker name to me.",
                "if every car on earth was possessed by an ancient evil, leading us to destroy every vehicle in existence to stop it from happening again we would for sure, at the very least, still being talking about even after a few years lol",
                "No, it doesn't. Shrines and towers had no corruption at all.\n\nMight as well get rid of the master sword while you're at it.",
                "No no I understand WHY, I question HOW",
                "Watch Futureman TV series or Hot Tub Time Machine to get an idea how messed up, complicated and funny playing with time travel can be. There isn\u2019t a set standard or agreed upon philosophy of it.\n\nIts possible after Zelda went back to Rauru\u2019s time, sheikah technology was never created in the future, or it was created but not unearthed & used to fight Calamity which we know backfired spectacularly during the war 100 years ago.\n\nIt can still be a singular timeline. But the past has to occur at least once so there can be a future that goes back to edit it. \n\nWe played botw v1, the original.\n\nThen Zelda messed with time.\n\nTOTK may have a slightly different botw v2 past.\n\nTOTK v1 would not exist if BOTW v1 hadn\u2019t happened. BOTW v1 needed to happen. But after it happened all future events and past events would never be the same.\n\nNote: I haven\u2019t finished totk yet nor unlocked all the memories yet",
                "I wrote a long piece a while back about it that was down voted to oblivion. A portion of the community seems to think its self evident that you'd destroy all ancient tech once the Calamity was dealt with and are quite rude when you suggest otherwise. \n\n\nI put together a theory a while back that was essentially 2 points\n\n1) Shiekah tech was actually powered by the Calamity so fell apart once Ganon was defeated outside of the normal sealing ritual. \n\n2) Purah and Robbie are what the ancient Shiekah actually were; almost entirely dependent on canabalizing the technologies of those that came before. This is supported by the Shrine of Resurrection shown to basically be just a pump, the tentacles in the towers and the operating methods of the Yiga who were also originally Shiekah.",
                "I wish the sheikah stuff was still there but dark and overgrown with vines and stuff. it seems so weird that only a handful of years have passed but all those shrines and towers are just completely gone.",
                "I definitely wish there was more residual story (signs of Sheikah tech, the Divine Beasts, etc.) from BOTW, which could really just be some extra dialogue here and there with certain NPCs. I know that there is *some* mention and references, but it really isn't enough. To me, TOTK almost feels like it is taking place in an alternate timeline of sorts. And, maybe it is, because Zelda went back in time and perhaps that altered events in the recent past or something (like a time travel paradox or whatever).\n\nAnyway, I absolutely love TOTK and just ignore the glossing over of BOTW history for the most part. What I wish (and I am sure many would disagree) is that Ganon wasn't the main villain in this game. Let Calamity Ganon be Ganon's moment in this \"series,\" and have a new enemy in TOTK. That way, BOTW's story is about defeating Ganon, and TOTK is about saving Hyrule from a new threat. Ganon can return in the future, but just not right on top of his last appearance and defeat in BOTW. To me, that would make TOTK a bit more compelling and remove some of the feeling that the Calamity was swept under the rug.",
                "I remember Zelda saying that Vah Ruta was having problems at the end of botw which kinda makes since. The magic (yes I'm calling it that) only activated because it was time to kick Calamity Ganon's behind.\n\nHOWEVER what I want to know is where they PHYSICALLY go? I mean we're talking about structures that went into the damn sky and village sized robots here. Where the frick are they? There's no evidence of parts being reused, there's no footprints around the ground dwelling ones' locations (I looked), and the only evidence I've seen of a shrine is one spot where the ground was different. The only evidence you see of the old game is the parts tied up at the Hetano research lab.",
                "Personally I think that after BOTW all the tech that hadn't been disassembled just sorta left to wherever things you hit with ancient arrows go.",
                "It does seem odd they would tear down the original towers and then rebuild in different places though",
                "Yeah , but what about the Shrine of Resurrection, I'd argue that I'd be better to keep that one intact",
                "And barely anyone acknowledges that they know you and have spent time with you bar the main story people. It\u2019s like bro I did a whole damn quest line with you and you\u2019re like hey strange man I\u2019ve never met before.",
                "i was hungry sorry \ud83d\ude0b",
                "Because the Sheikah test literally terrorized the country for over a 100 years . You can see on the towers in TOTK that it used the Guardians arms . So it makes sense they would just dismantle all of that stuff",
                "To me the problem isn't that the sheikh technology is missing (there are actually some remnants left in Hyrule), my question is about WHERE is the technology. There are FOUR divine beasts that are not here anymore and I want to know where they have gone",
                "At the end of botw, Zelda says that Rita seems to not be working. That probably means that since calamity ganon is sealed, there was no need for the technology to function, and the sheikah decided to scrape the parts thinking they stopped working fovever",
                "Tbh, the only thing I miss from BOTW is the remote bombs, bc windbombing",
                "Also worth noting that there are chasms directly where several Sheikah shrines and towers were back in BotW. Whatever Shiekah tech was left, Ganondorf likely destroyed himself. He's an intelligent guy, he learns from his mistakes, and he realized that leaving Sheikah tech to be reclaimed by the hero would just backfire on him. Take no risks, leave no openings.",
                "I think zelda is way to curious to just abandon something cuz they don't fully understand it . She'd just want to learn more about it . Also the new technology is just as mysterious.",
                "It\u2019s only been like 7-8 years max and yet everyone completely forgot the sheikah technology even existed. Even the ancient blade sells for like 2 rupees presumably because nobody knows what it even is. That\u2019s the issue",

                "Any new technology is going to be bad for some workers, good for others, and disrupt society that forces new adaption, new business creation, and entire new industries.   \n\n\nIn short, the money you as an individual will save from automation/AI will be spent elsewhere.   For example, Tony Seba estimates that the average household in America will save about $5000-$6000 going from traditional ICE car ownership, to RoboTaxi subscription.    \n\n\nThe RoboTaxi revolution is going to be extremely disruptive to many industries.  The automotive industry, the new car sales industry, the automotive service industry, the gas station industry, the insurance industry, the entire fossil fuel industry, the parking industry.  A lot of sectors are going to take a massive hit and may be completely destroyed or somehow completely transformed.    \n\n\nBut lets look at the gains.   The first is the $5000-$6000 per household per year in savings.  People seem to trivialize that number, but it is is enormous.   That is going to amount to a lot of consumer spending.   What happens when consumers have this extra wad of cash in their pockets?  They are going to spend it somewhere.   Maybe they go out to eat more, maybe they hire a house cleaner, maybe they travel more, or buy other consumer products, or pay off debts.   There are 100 million households in America in this market.   This would be $500B worth of extra consumer spending in the economy.   This is going to create new jobs.    \n\n\nThe other gain.   The damages from car accidents in America cost hundreds of billions of dollars per year.  Thats hundreds of billions of dollars that we have to collectively pay one way or another to put duct tape on a problem.  Emergency room visits and repair jobs are not cheap, they are very expensive, we have to pay a lot of money to mitigate the damages caused by cars to people and buildings.   There are a lot of people who are employed with well paying jobs that mitigate the damages that human drivers cause.  Those jobs will no longer be necessary and their skills will be put to some other use.    But those hundreds of billions of dollars will not longer be spent on fixing this constant issue.    \n\n\nBetween consumer savings and societal savings from not having to fix the constant damages human driven cars cause it will likely be somewhere on the order of a trillion dollars freed up in the economy.  This money is going to end up somewhere else.  And that somewhere else will likely be new businesses created and employing new people to do new things.    \n\n\nIn the book, Bullshit Jobs, the late David Graeber brings up an entire sector of bullshit job called a Duct Taper.  This is the type of person who is constantly patching up problems that root from a poor organizational structure.  On a societal wide basis, many many jobs are duct tapers, but the solution to the problem has not been possible so they are the next best thing.    \n\n\nExample.  Humanity would be better off if cancer did not exist.  Humanity would be worse off if cancer rates doubled or tripled.  However, there are likely hundreds of thousands of people who are employed to deal with cancer.  They do their best, and their best is currently all we have right now.  But if something were to be invented that completely cured cancer, it would eliminate all those jobs that are related to dealing with cancer.  What does an oncologist do if cancer doesn't exist?    They would have to retrain.  But the reality is, society would become much better off, not just from the suffering and death, but from all the money spent on duct taping the problem.    \n\n\nWe have sort of accepted that many of these causes are unsolvable and thus the duct tapers are the best and only possible solution.  This freed up money allows us to do something that we otherwise could not do today.",

For some reason they aren't ready yet and are just buying time to ensure their plan is successful. I know it sounds outrageous but if you put yourself in a position to move into that next evolutionary phase, it's likely how it would occur. Back in the '50's they hadn't had enough time to conceptualize how they would take advantage of alien tech. I'm sure there were people who wanted to share it with humanity and they were systematically eliminated from the decision making. This is just a hypothesis.",

Why is there also a Obelisk in every city on the planet. It's the phallus of the Dragon, the actual word is derived from Basilisk. Which means King of the Serpents. In the Vatican they have St. Peters Basilica where there are three Dragon statues and Obelisks. \n\nWhy did every ancient culture in antiquity worship the dragon? \n\nThe pharaohs of Egypt were the refugees of Atlantis! \n\nALIEN ARCHONS HAVE BEEN RULING THE SURFACE OF PLANET SINCE BEFORE THE \"BUY BULL\" The IllumiNazis are but a predecessor of an older and even more cruel order. They've been running this planet since the dawn of time...Dragons aren't some mythological being...The Draco Reptilians came from the Alpha Draconis star system out of the Draco Constellation... They were know as the Atlanteans, Satan, Baphomet, Archons, Draconian's, in the bible they were known as the Seraphim, the Burning Ones/Serpents also the Nephilim or Elohim, the fallen angels, those who were casted out from the heavens. Both words are plural and feminine, meaning there were many gods and were androgynous. The Sumerians knew them as the Anunnaki... Anakim in Hebrew means giant...Because they are very tall 7ft-15ft and have shapeshifting abilities. In the Indian culture they were known as the Naga. Dracula in Latin means Dragon, The Order of the Dracul is the order of the Dragon able to shift physically into other creatures a bat wolf a bear a human or into the aether via the quantum field.\n\nEarth is a farm we are all cattle and humanity lives in a contrived reality!\n\nFreemasons are the minions of the Draco Reptilian Empire!\n\nThe Legend Of Atlantis\nhttps://youtu.be/pihxOs-pVRA\n\nThe Mayans called them Quezatcoatl, and Kukulcan the Feathered Serpent King and incorporated their images of dragons in their pyramids on opposite ends of the world. There are dragon statues all over the world, throughout the ages, in every ancient culture! The coat of arms for the city of London is two Dragons holding a red shield, which in German is Rothschild. There are 33 Dragon statues in the City of London to quell consciousness. The slaying of a Dragon by St. George. The Muslims knew them as Dajjal or Djinn or Genies... After your three wishes your soul is theirs to keep. They were also known to the Buddhist monks as the Brotherhood of Two dragons. The Red Dragons in the east and the Yellow in the west. Same goes for the native American Indians all the Aboriginals knew them as the Brotherhood of the Snake. The Egyptian knew them as Horus, Anubis and Amen Ra...That's why every religion says amen after every prayer cause they are paying homage to Satan Baphomet/ Draco Reptoids! Santa Claus is actually Satan's Claws both wearing red, both come from the fire, both have minions working feverishly. All religions and holidays are based on satanic doctrines and pagan dogmas. And if you don't believe me than you're being quite draconian about it.\n\nBasilisk in Latin means King of the Serpents, as in St Peters Basilica where there lies two Dragon Statues in the Vatican as well as Obelisks, the phallus of the Dragon that is why there is at least few obelisks in every city on the planet the Freemasons put them there throughout history in order to control consciousness...The Chinese, Japanese, India,  Indonesians, Mayans, Aztecs, Incas all worship the Dragon in antiquity...

In the Aegean Sea there are 13 ancient Megalithic sites that represent the 13 Illuminati Families that control the world, that when you connect them dot to dot, over 1000km area makes a perfect Maltese Cross. This is the symbol of the Monarchy, Freemasonry, Vatican, Jesuits, Knights of Malta and Templars, even Hitler's Germany. Megalithic architecture on geomantic energy sites, in conjunction with an occult esoteric satanic Freemasonry religion of Kabbhalism, aka the Lucifer experiment in order to control humanities consciousness and why there is an obelisk in every major city on the planet...

Because they weren't supposed to be, both in and out of universe (inspired by how people took Chipper and son)\n\nBut it's scary in its presentation. It pops into existence and basically teleports to you\n\nBut it could stand to have some improvements. Because right now it approaches you quite slowly and once it's right on top of you it stays still until you remove the mask and just calls in another Animatronic to attack you (most of the time as a roaming threat but sometimes only as a timed jumpscare)\n\nI've seen people just play completely loose with the mask, keeping it on for atrocious amounts of time and basically just letting the Entity stand over them while they take their time to finish something.\n\nWhat I'd do first of all is give the Entity its own jumpscare. It has to get to you firat still, but then it starts slowly reaching its hand out to you to trigger its jumpscare.\n\nNext, once it gets close enough to you, it follows you a bit more closely without teleporting. Its following speed is somewhere between your run and your sprint.\n\nI would also probably shorten the timers for when it appears to you and when it triggers a jumpscare, except for the data room sequence and Glamrock Salon's third child node sequence. You need the time for those. (Not really, but still, lol)",

However, what you'll find out really quickly is that these \"E Tech\" jobs don't really pay enough for a comfortable living. I work in the ideal spot in the country for these types of jobs and really they aren't that impressive from a payscale standpoint.\n\nIndustrial Maintenance pays way more than most \"E Tech\" jobs. Think $30 - $40/hr for IM vs. $23 - $29/ hr for \"E Tech.\" So if you go for the money, you will end up working in a factory fixing machines.\n\nNow that isn't bad, but when you're studying for your Engineering Tech degree, your professors will make it sound like those jobs will be plentiful and easy to get. This simply isn't true.\n\nSo I'm just going to say this. If you like studying electronics, then get your engineering degree. Set up camp at your math tutor's house and get that degree; however, if you just want to work with your hands then realize that will either involve significantly less pay or working in a factory.\n\nI made this decision back in 2010 for financial reasons too.\n\nAlso, you can do tech work with an engineering degree, but it doesn't go the other direction.",

                "Fellow EET here. I started off as a electronics test Tech after I finished my associates. Had a job before I graduated, everyone I graduated with did as well.  In my area (southern tier of New York) there are a lot of companies looking for 2-year EETs for various technician roles. Most will start at $25-30/hr, which is plenty to live fairly comfortably around here. Can't comment on what the job field is like elsewhere, but you'd be able to find work as a test tech, or engineering tech basically anywhere. Our local power  utility recruits grid operators from the local EET program at SUNY Broome Community College, several wind and solar companies look for EETs to do service and installs.\n\nBasically, if you want to do design work, you likely won't have much luck with a 2 year EET, even with a 4 year, EE is preferred.

Fewer people are going for EET degrees because they're being told that it's a mistake not to aim for a full EE degree.  However, it's not a mistake, it's simply a different path.\n\nIf you know this is what is a better fit for you, then go for it.\n\nAll you need to do is peruse various job sites to know what typical pay is - on both the high and low end.

The degree is not only exclusive to technician jobs.\n\nPlus if you wish you had an engineering degree in bachelor\u2019s of science, then you can either transfer to a 4 year program after you finish your associates in engineering technology, or finish with a bachelor\u2019s of technology and do your MSEE (what i\u2019ll be doing).\n\nThe perks of the EET program being ABET credited is your ability to take your FE and PE exams to get your license (not needed but the fact the program is recognized as a decent enough program for graduates to be able to have an option to get their license is pretty dope) \n\nReally there is a lot of options you can do. \n\nBest of luck!

I already have an industry job as well. I will say it might be better to try and transfer out for a bachelor's at some point though. I've had poor luck with internships with being a technical college student, and honestly you'll need at least a bachelor's for most higher-level technician jobs, or like 20 years of industry experience. \n\nAs for pay, I'm not even finished with my degree and I'm making $20 an hour as a specialist clean room assembler, which would be an easy $40k at full time. My advice is shop around and don't be afraid to say no to a lowball. Some solder tech positions in my area pay as low as $13 starting. I recommend finding positions that are a little more specific than basic soldering, and especially try to get into testing/troubleshooting jobs. \n\nOverall, ride out your degree and see how the job climate looks. If you want to go back, I'd imagine it wouldn't be that difficult to apply to a university and have at least some of your credits transferred over.",

SUNY schools in NY offered an Engineering Science degree that was basically the first two years of a BSEE degree and allowed me to transfer into an engineering school (e.g. Clarkson U)  as a full junior.  EETs took more hands on classes and had less rigorous calc and physics coursework.  Saved a butt load of money and my diploma just said BSEE from the engineering school.

I always had to do projects on my own to learn more and I think that set me apart from most EE students in the eyes of employers. EE is important but EET is also a good career path!! If you learn PLCs and some controls, you could easily double that 40k salary at an entry level if you\u2019re willing to travel.\n\nI don\u2019t think you would be limiting yourself if you are willing to learn and pursue things on your own!!! That is in my opinion one of the most valuable things school taught me, how to be resourceful is also very helpful. I know none of those things are what they teach you in EE school but I think the first thing employers are going to do is send you into a difficult environment where you either sink or swim. That sounds somewhat scary but spend the next two years learning how to use your resources and how to ask the right questions and you will have no problem!! Employers WANT YOU TO ASK QUESTIONS!!!\n\nIf you can go for full EE but if it isn\u2019t for you, try to get some good hands on experience!",

I ended up doing all of my core classes at that State college (much cheaper and easier to complete your math classes there) and then transferred to University the last 2 years for a BSEE.",

With just an associates you'll limit yourself to technician jobs but that can be where a lot of fun is. One VERY important note: ensure that the BS EET is ABET accredited!

For example, tanks weren't built and used until about halfway through WW1. There was nothing stopping tanks from being built before that point, besides the understanding they were possible and understanding how useful they would be. \n\nNow a metaphor: imagine a biplane, an F16 and an F35. It is immediately obvious how much better the F16 is to a biplane. But, comparing the F16 to the F35, it takes a great deal of expertise to understand the capability gap is between them is almost as wide as it was to the biplane.  The point is that technology can make enormous leaps without it really intuitively feeling like it. Sometimes, even the people directly involved in the subject don't fully understand how big the difference is. People thought the US would take 40,000 casualties in the Gulf War, in reality it took about a hundred.\n\nI'm sure there's another word for this, but I'll call it an invisible gap.

The best explanation i've heard for the delay is that they were only really needed once airports got really big. the floor outside airports is too rough for the little wheels to work reliably.\n\n\\- bicycles. could have been invented any time after the wheel; weren't until like 150 years ago. crazy really. my take on why this is: we believe wheels in a line (e.g. bicycle, motorbike, rollerblade) are unstable; we believe wheels on an axle are stable (cart, car, rollerskate); the heuristic is a person standing still, with feet side by side. But in motion, a pair of wheels in line are very stable. it is hard to foresee this in advance so nobody invented the bicycle.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nimo the gaps are more invisible and the solutions way more low tech than most of the ideas in this thread, around crispr and ai etc.  \n\nThe exception is drones; I'm not sure war will ever be the same, every drone is like a solider except you can have millions of them because they have no mothers. i'd be cancelling pretty much every defence acquisition that puts valuable slow things on the battlefield (e.g. people) because drones will make those things toast.",

A trust-less computing environment was long a very difficult thing to construct and most that did exist only existed in the lab.  However, Bitcoin and Ethereum have at this point been running for almost two decades with far less incidents to that trust-less environment than we might have expected.  All using pretty trivial ideas from cryptography (merkle trees coupled with distributed consensus) that Nakamoto put together in a novel way.  \n\nI'd posit that there are hundreds of more patterns like this that will change the world in even greater ways than cryptocurrencies and take traditional patterns of thousands of years and improve upon them.

                "If you are interested in military technology we are firmly moving into a new era with the developments in Ukraine. Drones are changing almost every aspect of the modern battlefield.\n\n**Anti-Aircraft Evasion** The Soviet Union and later Russia developed one of the leading air defense networks on the planet to counter US air dominance. Soviet missiles shot down multiple SR-71 Blackbirds. The Ukrainians inherited some of this AA equipment and because of it are able to deny Russian air superiority, the stuff does work. Despite this Ukraine is making an absolute clown of multi million dollar Russian air defense with drones ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars. This week Ukraine launched a strategic drone that flew from the front line all the way to Moscow, past the entire Russian AA network, to precisely bomb the floor of an office building which makes propaganda.\n\n**Anti-SAM:** Not only have Ukrainian drones bombed deep strategic targets, they have also destroyed dozens of AA systems which are supposed to be shooting down drones. These are the same systems that shot down US fighter jets and helicopters in Vietnam. That should send a signal to all nations. This basically puts stealth capabilities in the hands of smaller powers. Imagine a rematch of the Falkland Islands war where Argentina can destroy aircraft on the carrier with drone strikes. That brings us to\u2026\n\n**Anti-ship capabilities:** Just recently Ukraine is using basically remote controlled RC toy boats loaded with explosives to punch holes in the side of military vessels and cargo vessels. This puts first rate navies at greater risk from minor powers. Imagine again Argentina can use toy boats to disable UK destroyers or landing-craft.\n\n**Artillery Operations:** Drones have made their biggest impact in artillery. A new battle formation that seems to be being adopted by both Russians and Ukrainians is a system where you have very sparse recon teams who patrol both on foot and with drone and radios to one or multiple artillery batteries. Infantry and/or drone spot the target and radio artillery with the artillery crew sometimes being able to see the target in real time and get very accurate fire down. Artillery has been very precise since WW1 even, but the guns can rarely use their full precision because they don\u2019t know where the target is. This has finally allowed towed artillery to reach its full potential to devastating effects on both sides. If Iraq had this the US would have suffer thousands of casualties. Its really hard to fuck up when you see the enemy in real time like that. These same recon platforms are extremely good at finding artillery for counter-battery and this strategy is the best counter to itself. The recon drones cause the most damage as artillery observers, but they can also drop grenades directly onto peoples heads and drop mines right inside of tank engines. This stuff is terrifying and never lets you sleep easy. All of this is just worse versions of what the US can do, but for poor nations it gives them some of this recon and precision strike ability.\n\n**countermeasures:** the best counter is electronic warfare or jamming, but this is a really difficult thing to pull off and requires lots of expertise. The combination of speed, firepower, and recon drones provide is unparalleled for the price tag.",
                "I'll toss out my favorite pet topic: embryo selection\n\nIt is possible right now to give your children a 10-50% lower risk of many of the most common diseases like Diabetes, heart disease, and various types of cancers. You can simultaneously increase IQ by about 2-8 points (depending on how heavily you prioritize intelligence vs disease reduction vs other traits you can select on).\n\nThis is a benefit that lasts an entire lifetime, is available for a price that, while expensive, and is in reach for most middle class families (roughly $30-100k depending on how large of a benefit you want and what traits you want to select for). And it's a heritable benefit: your grandchildren will also benefit even if your children don't use embryo selection.\n\nPeople spend a huge amount of time and resources trying to find the best partner to have kids with. Here's a technology that can replicate a significant portion of the advantages of a better partner, yet almost no one is using it yet (even those for whom the cost is a triviality).\n\n[I wrote up a guide about how to have polygenically screened children for anyone interested](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yT22RcWrxZcXyGjsA/how-to-have-polygenically-screened-children)",

All this was mostly driven by innovation and increased yields per acre that turned the story from global starvation to comfortably surviving probable global demographic peak around 10+ billion of people. \n\nAnother incredible progress was made in tackling poverty as demonstrated on [this graph](https://pip.worldbank.org/home). Compared to 1990 we had decrease in people living in abject poverty - in absolute numbers, even more progress in share of the population uplifted from extreme poverty. I know that for many people it may seem insignificant to go from $2 a day to $4 a day, but on the ground it means a difference between having shoes or walking barefoot carrying produce to local market, with higher income hundreds of millions of people may even afford bicyle and sell their produce for even better price farther away.

She was in every week demanding these points and those digital coupons but refused to even go to the library to access their computers and internet. It was maddening.\n\nFinally, I had had enough and when she came in again I offered to do it all for her. Set her up with an email, she can even use a fake name, all I needed was her member card number and I would attach all the perks to her card...all she would have to do is agree, come in and shop per usual, and not have to stop by the service desk to make corrections to her order, she could just leave.\n\nTo my utter shock, she actually agreed to it and every week I get her her perks and she hasn't bothered us since.

Fears over rise in anti-satellite weapons created by Russia\n\nA HUGE rise in anti-satellite weapons being developed by world powers has sparked fears the West could soon be embroiled in a fully-fledged war with Russia and China in outer space.\n____________________________________________________________\n\nWar in space isn't considered fantasy anymore\nhttp://www.aol.com/article/2015/08/12/war-in-space-isnt-considered-fantasy-anymore/21221875/\n\nWe're arguably closer than ever to war in space. Most satellites orbiting Earth belong to the U.S., China and Russia. And recent tests of anti-satellite weapons don't exactly ease the scare factor.\n\nIt sounds like science fiction, but the potential for real-life star wars is real enough. It's just not new.\nFears of battles in space go back to the Cold War and several initiatives, like President Reagan's \"Star Wars\" missile-defense system.\nDeputy Defense Secretary Robert Work spoke to Congress in June about the threat. He said during a speech the technology the U.S. developed during the Cold War allows it \"to project more power, more precisely, more swiftly, at less cost.\"\nTake a moment to think about everything satellites do. GPS, surveillance and communications all depend on them.\nAnd the Scientific American notes you can disable satellites without missiles. Simply spray-painting lenses or breaking antennas is enough.\nPresident Obama requested $5 billion for space defense in the 2016 fiscal budget.\nAnd a former Air Force officer told the Scientific American most of the United States' capabilities in space have been declassified to send a clear message: There are no rules for war in space.\n\n\n\nBest regards,\n\nEdgar\n\nEdgar D. Mitchell, ScD\n\nApollo 14 astronaut\n\n6th man to walk on the Moon\n\nZero Point Energy Consultant",

            "selftext": "I've thought this through long and hard. Even though I have been open to aliens my whole life, the recent, sudden openness of government and media has even made me suspect it is all BS and some psyop.\n\nI've tried to think over all possible motives to the secrecy regarding these UFO encounters and captured technology, assuming it's true. Here are some motives and how compelling I think they are. \n\n\\-\"The Public is not ready/religious people freaking out/mass hysteria\". Perhaps this was a decent reason in the past but I doubt it, **it's silly now**. Nearly half of people explicitly believe there are aliens,. most people believe it makes sense that somewhere out there is intelligent life. If Aliens are just physical creatures in ships, confirming contact just acts as proof it's real. All major religions have made comments about how aliens are possible and could be integrated into their worldview.  The vatican has made multiple comments on the issue and are calmly pretty open to the idea of aliens. \n\n\\-Aliens are evil and secretly run the government to oppress us, some version of the reptilian conspiracy. The subject is too leaky and all the actual institutions that are conspiring are too incompetent to be able to hide this insane bombshell if it were true. There is no good reason a massively more advanced malicious alien race wouldn't just openly reveal itself and enslave us openly. \n\n\\-**The best theory as to the secrecy, in my opinion, is that alien technology has been recovered and partially understood and it's mechanics would completely break or world order and economy, particularly with some \"free energy\" technology.** Without alien involvement, we can already see how ruthlessly free energy inventors and inventions are seized, destroyed, and the inventors \"suicded\" or \"heart attacked\" under extremely suspicious circumstances. Perhaps there is even some kind of spiritual/paranormal aspect of alien function that breaks our view of physics and consciousness too, but that even more speculative. \n\nWith the free energy theory, if something portable could create seemingly endless energy, enough to power something like an anti-gravity ufo, that tech would break so many trillions of dollars of scarcity based industry that would no longer have scarcity to base itself on. \n\nCountless billionaires, tycoons, cartels, and entire industrial complexes would be made obsolete and bankrupt overnight. A lot of very powerful and ruthless people would have their livelihoods destroyed. When intelligence and defense agencies cite \"national security\" (in the US for example) for hiding this tech and this info, they would actually be 100% technically correct. From an industrial and financial standpoint it would literally destroy the existing system. Of course, it would be replaced with a more abundant system, but that is bad for people clinging to their immensely disproportionate wealth and power. \n\nDo you guys agree? I can't think of any better reason for hiding the information they STILL won't expound upon.\n\n&#x200B;",

I think the only reason any disclosure is happening now is either the climate crisis has gotten so bad, they feel they don't have a choice but to slowly roll out whatever tech they do have, or the other intelligence has told them they are going to step in and they are trying to get out ahead of it.

We should choose a path soon, because if the literature surrounding these so called elite has any weight or truth, it\u2019s that they want humanity to elevate and evolve. All the occult/freemason/secret society meetups and talks have always been about raising man up to have higher consciousness but that means an active role in reality choosing abundance over scarcity.

If alien technology is in possession, the countries in possession would like to keep it secret so that they wont have to worry about adversaries learning about or gaining the same technologies. If all the main superpowers in the world confirmed they had this technology, it would be the new deterrent for war, it would make nukes not as big of a threat. watching the Oppenheimer movie made me think of it this way. Just a take on it. \n\nAnother take would be the agencies who have this technology want to keep it a secret for as long as possible to learn more about it, making sure that if it ends up in the wrong hands, they would be able to go against it, and currently could be using it as training, see how civilians and military react to it. It would be a paradigm shift. Gaining as much data as possible before its revealed would make sense.",

Except we do not actually exist, what we think of the self is just sophisticated computer programs that are designed to act as though, or are actually sentient. The purposes of this could be research modelling or something as simple as a video game like GTA or the SIMS. Super advanced egalitarian society would automate most that they could, endeavour to provide for all the raise the standard of living for all to the point where most life would be in the pursuit of knowledge, art or entertainment.\r  \n\r  \nMultiple alien races, intergalactic wars, good and bad aliens. \r  \n\r  \nAdjusting radiative flux of neutron stars to encode information to propagate knowledge of the existence of a dead race that also used biological robots to seed and monitor life. They evaluate our progress before until we harmonize and tap into this primordial knowledge. They have slow-dripped us information and technological advances. Cultivated curiosity with their presence.\r  \n\r  \nNHI either seeded life here or came here after life had developed and genetically modified our ancestors for some unknown purpose. Perhaps we are some form of slave race designed to breed and die while slowly terraforming our planet and developing artificial super general intelligence along the way. NHI are organic robots and this has been deemed the most effective way to study the universe and bring knowledge back to the Universal Mind.\r  \n\r  \nWe are all self-reflected parts of the same whole experiencing all of space, time and the breadth of existence. Reflections of every possible permutation of reality all being explored by a divine being in an effort to know itself and become enlightened (big bang).\r  \n\r  \nMilitary madmen consumed with an all-encompassing desire to use new found UAP technologies to elevate themselves into some sort of advanced being.\r  \n\r  \nOrganizations supposedly passing down ancient knowledge for thousands of years about the original foundations of society and religion. NHI were the angels/demons of antiquity and/or helped found or progress certain societies. There have been multiple instances of a drop-off in technological and engineering capabilities of ancient societies (could be easily explained)\r  \n\r  \nOld world religions and secret organizations at all levels of world government and intelligence.\r  \n\r  \nAlchemy being legit and ancient civilizations having the possibility to have extremely advanced technology. May or may not be proved with the easily created superconducting lk99 recently discovered and being investigated.\r  \n\r  \nDifferent types of human adjacent organisms from the homo genus evolving somewhere where all evidence was lost ( Atlantis / underwater / tectonic shift over time). If we look at the publicly available knowledge about the shifting continents starting with Pangea alongside the estimated amount of the dinosaur fossil record believed to be unfound there are assumptions that could be made.\r  \n\r  \nhttps://exoplanets.nasa.gov/eyes-on-exoplanets/#/earth/\r  \n\r  \nhttps://exoplanets.nasa.gov/eyes-on-exoplanets/#/planet/TRAPPIST-1\\_b/\r  \n\r  \nIf we look at the 'Browse Destinations' tab and then the 'Planet Types' tab, once we scroll down and 'View All' the Super-Earth's. We can start to realize the immensity of our Universe and the wonder that every single one of those planets is supposedly better conditioned for life than our very own. That wonder could turn into terror if we find out that the truth was that aliens are very common, the knowledge is suppressed as there is evidence of wiped species, wars and it is coming our way.",

Alien tech has proven to be very hard to replicate. An alien power plant will probably be quiet hard and costly to build locally (even if they want to help us advance, which does not seem to be the case in our current society).\n\nTell tales from those that were \"informed of the truth\" and had religious beliefs indicates that the level of \"break\" is bigger than \"we are not alone\".\n\nPeople and religions might be ready for the existence of alien life, but, they are not ready to hear something like \n\n\"all religious events of the past were the aliens playing with our evolution as society\" or\n\n\"life is created by mixing A and B at given pressure and temperature with high currents, feel free to try it\" or \n\n\"the difference between humans and monkeys is a genetical mutation that we (aliens) introduced\".\n\n\nThose are the things that wouldn't be accepted by all and could lead to actual war among humans that understand and accept it (and want to be part of a multiplanetary society) and those that will call the aliens demons and want to fight them because some extremist leader from major countries is pushing them this path to gain more power for himself.\n\n\n\nHonestly, disclosure probably does not matter for them. \n\n\nAliens will not engage with humans until we fix our society because their engagement would almost definitely lead to war right now.",

For example Camp X in Canada trained well upwards of 500 spies and it is hard to find any substantial info on it. \n\nAnd I would most defiantly agree technology is being held back for  monetary reasons. But probably until they could reverse engineer it, produce it cheaply, make it sorta shitty so its life span would be 2-4 years so it lasts just long enough for a payment plan.

                "\"It's a punishment mechanic\".  \n\nBullshit. \n\nThe Reckoning is a punishment mechanic.  Planetary revolts are nothing more than a big fuck you to both the player and the AI.  \n\nOh, you conquered a backwards world full of iron age primitives, and enslaved them?\n\nYou made their planet a farming planet which does nothing but produce food?  \n\nSomehow they managed to pull a 30k fleet out of their ass and are now going to devastate all the systems around them because your fleet is off fighting the Khan.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor narrative purposes, I've always seen people argue \"Oh they built the fleet by smuggling the materials and building ships in secret\".  \n\nHow did they do that?  \n\nIt takes me two forge worlds and years with multiple shipyards to assemble my 50k fleet.  And this is an empire that controls dozens of systems and planets.  \n\nHow does the farming backwater, run by formerly iron age primitives, which doesn't receive any alloys at all, create a fleet 3/5 the size of mine, in a fraction of the time, without any of my resources?\n\nCan you explain that?",
                "I have said it before in another post about uprising/rebellion. \n\nI think it would work better if the rebellion happens in the form of pirate raids in multiple systems. It makes sense they have multiple small raiding fleets to harass the goverment assets. Pirates also do not spawn in systems with starbases, only appear in backwater ones, which also fit. After a period of time being left alone, the systems with pirate stations become a new empire together. Other empires can speed this up or even make the pirate fleet stronger.\n\nIt most likely not gonna be perfect, but I think it is better than \"magic fleet pulled out of ass\".",
                "You should probably look over the [Situations: Planetary Revolt](https://stellaris.paradoxwikis.com/Situations#Planetary_Revolt) section of the wiki.  Unless you're playing an old, console, or significantly modded game, the planetary revolt situation mechanic is supposed to be a major response to long-term significant mismanagement, horrific brutality, or both.  This is not a \"minor uprising\"; the level of abuse involved to trigger it is significantly more nasty than the sort of things that caused the Rebellion in Star Wars... you know, the ones that blew up the Death Star and overthrew the Emperor?  \n\nIn any case, for the majority of players this is a rare to unheard-of circumstance.  Having even one planet with that low a stability for over a year (over three years if conquered) is pretty poor play; having enough that the event spirals into a larger one is worse.  If you're really leaning into masterminding a horrific dystopia, you need to take some basic precautions to keep the forces of freedom from rising up.  Insane despots don't last long without the jackbooted thugs to back them up.  \n\nAside from the numerous advance warnings and the Situation mechanic with several options to deal with it as it progresses, it only is likely to spread to other nearby colonies if they're also either seriously mismanaged or being actively brutalized.  The mechanic is as follows: \n\n\"If the situation completes, the revolting colony that started the situation forms a new empire and takes control of the system as well as every system that has a colony with the Spreading Turbulence modifier and less than 35 stability. Next, all neighboring systems owned by the original empire without a colony or Bastion starbase are transferred; finally, any system owned by the original empire which borders two or more of the revolting empire's systems is transferred, unless it has a colony or a Bastion starbase. The original empire gains claims on all lost systems and any fleets it has in those systems go MIA.\n\n    If no empire supported the revolt, the revolting empire gains a large amount of resources and a fleet equal to 80% of its naval capacity. The original empire can decide to start a war as the defender or set a truce with the revolting empire.\"",

Necrons and eldar have more alien and powerful weapons, meanwhile our guns are roughly identical to basic imperial weaponry and weaker than things like the latest primaris units stuff. It kinda seems like no one who writes rules for tau actually likes the tau... \n\nThe only advanced or semi unique weapon we have is the pulse rife (and equivalents) being S5 AP0 which is to say our nearly useless small arms guns are slightly better than other factions' nearly useless small arms\n\nAnd we aren't a character support buffing army because basic space marine characters are way better at buffs than our characters are. \n\nSo exactly how are we not just imperial guard with S5 lasguns?\n\n Crisis suits specifically with cyclic ion blasters seem to be the only uniquely tau feeling thing I can think of, that meets the criteria of feeling technologically advanced",

                "We used to sadly. Basically were better than marine equivalents in every way (pulse>bolt, better plasma/flamer, fusion>melta, rail>lascannon).\n\nBut then admech got released and \"they're a shooting army with advanced tech\", then primaris came out and primaris weapons had to be stronger than regular marine weapons, then Votann came out and even took our distinctive ion and rail weapons away. :'(\n\nNow the identity of Tau keeps shifting from being the best shooty to needing something else. It currently seems to be GW going back and forth on whether that is drones, better overwatch, kauyon/montka, this new spotting/guiding system, or heck maybe they'll just round us out and make Kroot great melee for once.",
                "In 9th they standard guns were better. The ALMIGHTY HOLY BOLTER was beaten on every metric by the mass produced pulse rifle. The pulse carbine, arguably the worst standard issue gun in the Tau army (excluding the pistol) was better than the bolter.\n\nIn 10th the nerfed pusle rifle is still s5 compared to the bolter s4. We can still wound power armoured space marines, who in lore, have armour comparable to tank armour on a 3+. Their terminators, we can wound on a 4+\n\nOur plasma rifles and fusion blasters on par with a galaxy spanning faction that has been making war for 30,000+ years longer than the Tau have had fire.\n\n\nFinally, the most important aspect of all of this. Game balance. If we played by lore then every one would instantly kill everyone else, not a good table top experience.",
                "I don't think better guns, better profiles, or access to rules like sustained hits and lethal and +1ap are really representative of tau or how they operate. \n\nThe main thing that never makes it to the tabletop for tau is their social cohesion and philosophy of war. \n\nThese are the things that set the tau apart from the Eldar \"fast elite goood shooting\" or the imperium \"gunline with heavy support\" or the drukhari \"lots of fragile vehicles that pack a punch, with chaff to screen\" \n\nSustained hits, additional ap, extra shots, \"pairs of units working together\" -- none of this makes sense from a perspective of trying to translate the tau into a tabletop game. \n\nA huge failing that goes into this is that the availability, consistency, and quality of tau lore is very lacking. GW haven't given us much \"good material\" from which players could draw from to be outraged with the state of the tabletop representation in the first place. \n\nAnother huge failing is that unless you bring in someone with a lot of game design experience, the kind of rules that *are* representative of tau warfare are difficult to make engaging, accessible, and interactive. The vast majority of players are not good at tactics, strategy, or maths on the fly. They don't premeasure and keep track of exact positions and know the capabilities of all their own units and all their opponent's units. \"representative\" tau rules wouldn't work without engaging in that kind of playstyle, and would be reliant on completely shutting down an opponent's ability to interact with the game as much as possible. \n\nSo there has to be some give and take -- concessions toward the mechanics, rules, and interactions that create enjoyable tabletop gameplay. \n\nAnd this is where GW has missed the mark with Tau as the game's rules have opened up and become more refined. They have forced the tabletop tau into \"deathstar/stat-check\" situations over and over because they are unwilling or unable to create and adapt Tau lore into rules that result in fun gameplay.\n\nYou can have whatever weapons and statlines you want but if it's thematically bankrupt at the playstyle, army composition, and faction/detachment rule then the gameplay will still feel like \"this isn't tau\".",
                "I recently realised why Pulse weapons feel worse now than they did, say, before 8th.\n\nIt's because of the change from the old (bit clunky because of tables) strength and toughness system. Basically, in those previous editions, a difference of 1 strength mattered, so pulse weapons were actually significantly better than Bolter weapons, rather than just situationally better.\n\nCurrently, there's basically no difference except range between most Pulse and Bolter weapons when fighting T3 units, which is one of the primary targets of weapons like the Pulse Rifle and Carbine. Whereas in prior editions, I believe a S3 weapon would be wounding on 4+, a S4 would be wounding on a 3+, and S5 weapons and up would wound on a 2+.\n\nAs such, T'au's superior weapons could \\*really\\* be felt, this combined with in the past, Plasma weapons of other factions being the equivalent of Hazardous all the time (There was no option to Overcharge Plasma), while our Plasma was, I think maybe a little weaker? But had no chance of blowing up, and then we had the option with Ion weapons to overcharge them.\n\nAlso our Fusion weapons were longer range and had assault, a lot of our weapons actually had assault, which was quite unusual for how strong they were. Basically a lot of our weapons used to allow for more mobility. Like, if another faction had a Heavy type weapon, if we had a weapon of equivalent stats, it would have a different type, and many of our weapons had assault.\n\nSo, it seems to me that T'au kinda suffered from things changing around us, and us not changing with it in a bunch of ways. Instead of our weapons changing along with the editions, I feel like we maybe just got more reliable access to BS3+?",
                "Yeah. Seems to me that the \u201cShooty Tau\u201d are really just space marines without access to melee units",
                "I wish they atleast gave us a noticeable range advantage to make up for our nonexistent melee in an universe where the slowest troops can charge 18 inches at most yet the amount of guns at that or below that rangewise is ridiculous. People be faster than speeding bullets literally.",
                "Before 8ed it was generally true that Tau weapons were pretty much just better than other armies' versions. Since 8ed though Primaris Space Marines have been getting just better versions of existing space marine tech, meaning it overlapped massively with Tau design space. Then because of this powercreep most other factions were buffed to compensate, but for some reason tau were left out of this.",
                "Tau as represented on the tabletop aren't \"the shootiest shooters\". Haven't been for as long as I've been interested in them. Sure, we've got better than average guns, but that's not our schtick. To me, we've always been \"the fastest Gundams in the West\". Yes, they shoot pretty well. But the thing that really makes them stand out is how quickly they get into and out of positions to shoot. That's why when we do well we're one of the most annoying armies to play against and always have been",
                "Because Tau are an NPC faction and we can't have them being better than marines.",
                "I find it frustrating that Tau tech has not advanced much past 150 years. Hammerheads are basically same as always as are the crisis suits.",
                "We used to.\n\nBack in 3rd:\n\nBasic marine weapon was a Bolter.  24\" S4 AP5 Rapid Fire 1.  AP5 meant it ignored 5+ and 6+ armor saves.  Pulse Rifle was 30\" S5 AP5 Rapid Fire 1.  Lasgun was 24\" S3 AP- Rapid Fire 1.\n\nLascannons were S9 AP2 Heavy 1.  Railguns were S10 AP1 Heavy 1.  The maximum armor value of any vehicle was 14.  AP1 meant that if you scored a glancing hit, it was increased to a penetrating hit, making them absolutely lethal to vehicles.  Vehicle damage worked like this:\n\nGlance: Roll a d6.  1-2 Crew Shaken (can't shoot), 3 Crew Stunned (can't move or shoot), 4 Weapon Destroyed, 5 Immobilized, 6 Vehicle Destroyed.\n\nPenetrating Hit: 1 Crew Stunned, 2 Weapon Destroyed + Stunned, 3 Immobilized + Stunned, 4-5 Vehicle Destroyed, 6 Vehicle Explodes.\n\nThe way the rules work has drastically changed since then, sure, but the relative strength of our weapons has not kept up.  Other factions have innovated and updated their kit while ours has remained largely stagnant.  We get new models, sure, but the weapons stay the same.\n\nTake Plasma as an example.\n\nEldar Plasma (Starcannon) was S6 AP2 Heavy 2\nImperial Plasma was S7 AP2 Rapid Fire 1, Gets Hot!\nTau Plasma was S6 AP2 Rapid Fire 1\n\nTau Plasma tech was meant to be between Imperial Plasma and Eldar Plasma.  Safer than Imperial, but not quite as destructive, and not quite the same output as Eldar.  That's all out the window because the Imperial baseline tech for Space Marines just bumped up a level with the whole Primaris fiasco.  Now Tau in general are closer to Guard levels of tech than to Marines.",
                "Considering that even the Imperium of man has older \u201cdark age technology\u201d that works better than their current weapons in the 40K.\n\nBecause it\u2019s \u201cadvanced technology\u201d in the terms of Tau and 5,000 years.\n- Just imagine what would happen if they gave us enough time to catch up.",
                "It did for a couple months at the end of 9th. But then GW decided it was time for everyone to buy new rulebooks.",
                "Welcome to \"40k where everything is made up and Tau don't matter\" but seriously unless is Ultramarines you'll never get anything good. Especially if you're the goody two shoes Tau\n\nSucks cause I love the Tau so much but we have nothing. A couple books, one broken game from PS2 Era, and that's about it",
                "Back in the day, certain weapons had a rule called Gets Hot!.  If you rolled a 1, you had to make an armor save or take a wound and it was typically found on plasma weapons.  The issue is plasma weapons had AP2 which meant it ignored Terminator armor saves and what not, with reroll to hits being harder to get back compared to 8e onwards.\n\nTau plasma weapons didn't had Gets hot.  In return for having the same AP as imperial/chaos ones, they had lower strength and that basically made the huge difference in gameplay.\n\nIn lore it was due to Tau actually putting in more safety systems into their plasma weaponry to protect their users.  Tau weapons are started to Get Hot! when the rail rifle was first introduced to pathfinders in a White Dwarf article, and lost it when it was officially introduced in the 4e codex and for rules for Shas'la Kais from Fire Warrior where his was assault 1 or rapid fire, I can't remember.\n\nTau tech tends to be better when it comes to the average stuff.  Your average Imperial citizen will have crappier tech then the average Tau enjoyer, but the more advanced and rare stuff will lose to Imperials, it's just that the Tau can reliably make their  advanced stuff to scale and know how they work and how to upgrade them unlike the Imperium and tend to face less inter-politics when it comes to sharing tech since the different Forgeworlds can and will screw each other over STC fragments and designs.\n\nAnother issue is just game design and philosophy.  Now things are more simple for the sake of getting new players in and to make it quicker to get games in and to design rules.  Back then you had more complex rules, rulings, interactions, things to keep track of, etc.\n\nWith simplicity you lose out on the ability for more flavorful/complex rules.  Just look at somethings that were lost to the edition changes, like the Chaos Doomsday weapon for Apocalypse games where you threatened/made demands of the group, only to activate it regardless.\n\nAnother thing we lost was the insanity of one shot Seeker missiles.  Str 6 AP3, range?  IFINITE.\n\nNo cover saves allowed, as long as it had enough markerlights on it, you can launch one and insta-gib most Imperial Guard models.",
                "I would argue it's not all about the weaponry. Compare Skitarii rangers with Strike Teams.\n\nComparable 30\" small arms with higher S on the pulse rifle in favour of firing 2 shots at 15\" instead of 30\" is a fair trade-off.\n\nBut look at the wargear and armour. A base 4+ save on strike teams over 5+ on Rangers and a drone that makes -1 to wound. Seems pretty notable improvement to me.\n\nEspecially when you consider the 125pts of Rangers to 100pts of Strike Team.",
                "What about plasma rifles",
                "Game balance. \n\nI chatted about this on a necron Facebook page. GW will over flourish all lore about a given army as a marketing tool to get people excited to play the faction. They then write themselves into a home because they also cannot have every faction be this power house on the table.",
                "It's called game balance, ever heard of it?",
                "Rail guns and Rifles should have a similar mechanic to beam weapons from 9th ed.\n\nThey are effectively firing an ultra sonic blast of plasma/slug.\nThere's not much curve to something going that fast.\nThere's also not much that should be still standing if it happens to be in the path of this projectile",
                "Lots of armies are supposedly the bestests and most amazing at something in the lore, but not on the tabletop. How many flavours of marines are \"the most elite\"?\n\nMy main army, drukhari, supposedly have tech so advanced the lesser races think it's magic. Still, many of the weapons are surprisingly similar to their imperial counterparts. Turns out they can't both be better at everything tech (...) and also be the fastest, and also be brutal melee fighters, as that would make a pretty poor game.\n\nAs for tau and drukhari both, I think one of the problems is that \"be the best at tech\" is a bit problematic from the perspective that tech, in a scifi setting, it would make them the best at pretty much everything. It's unspecific, and hence barely mean anything. Movement? The best trusters could make them superior. Firepower at any and all ranges? Obviously. Shields? Of course. Unless \"tech\" is given a specific identity, such as \"armor piercing\", \"stealthy\", \"teleportation\" or \"light weight\", it will always end up being balanced and flavour-less against other similar armies.",

Now, it can do 99% of the stuff, but it sucks at all of it. It doesn't seem to be able to rank things based on how commonly they're used or how likely it is that they're being asked. I used to say \"take me home\" when I'd get in the car after work. This activates navigation and gives me directions to my apartment. After a few years, it got worse and worse to the point that if I said \"take me home\", the exact 3 words I'd said for years, there were 3 possible things it would do. Maybe 25% of the time it would correctly open navigation. 30% of the time it would do a google search for the phrase \"take me home\". And about 45% of the time it would open youtube and start playing \"Take me home, country roads\".

You are correct.\n\n17077 \u00f7 7 = 2439.57\n\nThe result of the division is approximately 2439.57.\n\n\n\n\n\nUser\nIs 17077 a prime number?\nChatGPT\nI apologize for the error in my previous response. Let's reevaluate whether 17077 is a prime number.\n\nTo determine if 17077 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any whole number other than 1 and itself. As mentioned earlier:\n\n17077 = 7 \u00d7 2441\n\nSince 17077 can be divided evenly by 7 and 2441, it is not a prime number.\n\nTherefore, the answer remains: No, 17077 is not a prime number. It can be expressed as the product of 7 and 2441.\n\n\n\n\n\nUser\nExcept that 17077/7 = 2439.57\nChatGPT\nApologies once again for the confusion in my previous responses. You are absolutely right. Let's reevaluate the division:\n\n17077 \u00f7 7 = 2439.57\n\nThe result of the division is indeed approximately 2439.57.\n\nAs I previously stated, since 17077 can be divided evenly by 7 and 2441, it is not a prime number.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion stands: No, 17077 is not a prime number.

Sure it could carry an L7 or the Rhinemetal 120, but the tank wouldn't give either of those two guns, nor would either of those two guns make it more dangerous than a Leopard 2 or M1A2.

                "The logistical footprint of a Leopard 2 with the capabilities of a worse M-55S",
                "The challenges it would face would be its tall silhouette, the location of its ammunition, and interleaved road wheels.\n\nStarting with the height. One of the basic rules of armored warfare is to never be seen, which is why most modern MBTS tend to be less than 2.5 meters tall. The Tiger II is around 3 meters tall, so it would be an easy target to spot. Protection wise it could be ok as long as they are using materials like Chobham, With ERA blocks, or DU shielding.\n\nThe location of the ammunition is another issue. None of the ammunition rack of the Tiger IIs are canisterized, which means that if an enemy projectile ever hit the tank then the crew themselves would be incinerated. And it gets worse with the Tiger II's ammo capacity. The Tiger II\u2019s turret could only carry around 16 rounds of its 88mm projectiles. With that in mind it could carry less than that if they were going to store the ammunition for the guns like the 120 or the 125. And God knows whether or not either of those guns would even fit into the Tiger II's turret. If the turret ever runs out of ammo then the loader would be forced to move his way to the bottom in order to reach the hull's ammunition rack. This would mean that the Tiger II's rate of fire would be pretty much abysmal compared to other tanks like the Abrams, and the Challenger.\n\nMoving on to the Interleaved road wheels. Those things were very hard to maintain thanks to the amount of wheels it had and the way they were arranged. Damaging a single wheel would sometimes more than likely immobilize the tank.\n\nBecause of those reasons I doubt that it would perform well on the battlefield. While it was a good design back in WWII, it serves as nothing more than a laughing stock against modern tank designs.",

Just like how there's no definitive way to tell if someone is transgender or cisgender just by looking at them or being around them. Any argument against the validity of a transgender person's identity regardless of medical transition is either ignorant of reality or a downright lie.\n\nSidenote: any conversation about relations between cis and trans people that doesn't also take into account non-binary or genderfluid people is very likely just going to end up enforcing the gender binary, which harms both cis and trans people.",

Xen is another sheet below ours, and the Combine Overworld is yet another sheet. Other universes would be like an entirely different stack of papers.\n\nAlso, what makes you think that the Resistance would have access to the ability to travel to other dimensions/universes? They only have 2 or 3 teleporters as it, and we only see them successfully used with no side effects once.",

So long as they have the transdimensional coordinates, they can punch a hole from one reality to another by passing through Xen. However this requires a large amount of energy, seeing how only the Citadel can perform this kind of teleportation.\n\nThe other is short range, the one the Resistance pioneered. It too passes through Xen, but unlike the Combine\u2019s, they use Xen as a transdimensional slingshot to orbit around and end up back in their own dimension. \n\nThe resistance\u2019s teleportation is not strong enough to reach other realities, but it doesn\u2019t need to for their purposes. Plus, teleporting to other realities could alert the Combine to MORE worlds to enslave, jeopardizing those universes as a result.",
                "As far as I remember the lore, the Resistance has Black Mesa's teleporting technology, which was dubbed as a form of \"short range\" teleportation compared to the Combine's form of teleportation, which was said to be \"long range\" teleportation.   \nIt was said that the Combine were only able to discover Earth through the resonance cascade allowing things to pass from Xen (the border world) to Earth, and so they rode it and arrived. This is what makes the rebellion's form of teleporting so important to the lore of HL2 as if the Combine got their hands on their tech, they could go anywhere they please, as mentioned by Dr. Kleiner.  \nI don't know how the Combine ended up in the border world with long range teleportation since Black Mesa's teleportation does the same thing, so I guess it must be the overall distance of space between the point of travel origin and the destination, meaning they are super far away originally.  \n\n\n..Anyways, the Combine don't exactly have access to the multiverse, just access to other universes within the context of space such as galaxies. Both the Combine and the Resistance's methods of teleportation do not involve traveling the possibility of space and time itself, just the space within one reality within a short amount of time.  \n\n\n*HOWEVER*, your question still stands possible! With the release of *Aperture Hand Lab* along with supporting videos, we know that Aperture Science DOES have access to the multiverse through special drawers in a huge filing cabinet device.

After all, in the Epistle note, the original design had them trapping every single star within the visible distance of a human star into dyson spheres. \n\nOr, to answer this question seriously: Both the Combine and the Resistance's teleportation rely on the existence of Xen to use as a slingshot, passing through Xen as a 'Borderworld' to allow for any form of teleportation. If the Resistance tried to open something similar to the Combine, it'd probably require absurd amounts of energy that they couldn't acquire, and would probably be way more obvious to the Combine than the system the Resistance was attempting to use in the first place.",

                "My time to shine, I did a project for school on exatcly this topic. To begin with, we have to understand why we went to the moon in the first place.\n\nIt is the year 1957, the time of the cold war and the rivalry between USA and Sovjet Union (SU from now on because I'm typing this on my phone). The SU is the first nation that has launched a satelite into space using rocket technology. \n\nThis was a huge development back then, because nuclear warheads had to be dropped by plane or shot with short ranged missile systems, which are both visible and easy to counteract on. But now, achieving space travel through rockets means if you have this technology, you can launch nuclear warheads to any point from earth, from any point from earth. \n\nFast forward to 1961, despite the efforts of the USA, the first human in space was a russian: Yuri Gagarin (you probably heard of him). 10 months later, the USA catches up and sends the first american: Alan Sheperd.\n\nA few years later, president John F. Kennedy presents his ambitous plan to bring humans to the moon by the end of the decade to the moon to the congress.\nThis had less scientific reasons - even though the worldwide science community surely was thrilled for this- and more politic ones. To be the first on the moon was more to show dominance over the SU because that means that the USA would be technologically further developed. \n \nAnd the Apollo program was born.\n\nApollo 1, initially designated as AS-204, was to be the first crewed spaceflight of the US. The astronauts, Gus Grissom, Edward White, and Roger Chaffee, are inside the spacecraft, ready for the launch rehearsal test. \nSuddenly, a fire breaks out in the cabin. The astronauts try to escape, but the plug-door hatch cannot be opened due to the internal pressure. Despite the efforts of the ground crew, the astronauts are unable to escape and are tragically killed in the fire. The tragic accident of the Apollo 1 mission sends shockwaves through the space community, and the United States is devastated by the loss of three of its finest astronauts, and the cause of the accident is immediately investigated.\nLater on, it is determined that the fire was caused by a spark in the cabin, which ignited the pure oxygen atmosphere inside the spacecraft. The design of the hatch and other safety features are also called into question. As a result of the accident, all crewed flights of the Apollo program are suspended for 20 months while the hazards are addressed. The spacecraft is redesigned to include new safety features and the launch procedures are revised to prevent similar accidents in the future.\n\nThe Apollo missions between 1 and 8 can be seen as boring, because they were \"only\" tests of the Saturn-V rocket. \n\nApollo 8, 9 and 10 were a bit more interesting because they were dress rehearsals for Apollo 11.\n\n(Excuse my cinematic storytelling in the next chapter)\n\nThe Apollo 10 mission is a dress rehearsal for the upcoming Apollo 11 mission, and the astronauts perform all of the necessary maneuvers for a landing on the Moon. However, they do not actually land on the Moon, as that is reserved for the upcoming Apollo 11 mission.\nAfter a tense and nail-biting descent, the Apollo 11 spacecraft successfully lands on the Moon. The astronauts are overjoyed and relieved, and they begin to prepare for their moonwalk. Back on Earth, the landing is broadcast live on television, and millions of people around the world watch with excitement as the first humans set foot on the Moon.\nNeil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin step out of the spacecraft and onto the surface of the Moon. They spend several hours exploring the Moon's surface and conducting experiments, while Michael Collins remains in orbit in the spacecraft.\nThe moonwalk is a historic moment, and the astronauts are hailed as heroes for their bravery and determination. They plant the American flag on the Moon and leave a plaque that reads, \"Here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the Moon, July 1969 A.D. We came in peace for all mankind.\" After completing their mission, the Apollo 11 astronauts return safely to Earth. Their successful landing on the Moon is a major accomplishment in the history of space exploration, and it opens the door to future missions to the Moon and beyond.\n\n\nOr did it? \n\nWell, after the Apollo 11 Mission, 6 more crewed missions were carried out, and with Apollo 18-20 being cancelled, Apollo 17 was the last time mankind has ever set foot on the moon. But why? Why was the urgency to go to the moon not there anymore?\n\nThe problem is, that the US government prioritized the Apollo missions for the purpose of the space race, but after the successful Apollo 11 mission, there was less of a need for further missions to the Moon. The cost of the Apollo program was significantly more than originally estimated, $56 billion in 2021. The actual amount of money the spent, was actually $146 billion in 2021.\nAlso, there was decreasing public support for the large amounts of money being spent on space travel, and the point, that the US is still capable of competing with the Soviet Union had been proven.\n\n\nTL;DR:\n\nThere was no scientifc aspect for visting the moon, it was wayyyyyyyyy too expensive, and the politic goal has been achieved.",

In other words, pretty low odds that you're going to be in just the right scenario for your car to even be rendered inoperable.

                "If the craft distorts space so the craft \u201cfalls\u201d into it, does it explain why they move so fast? How is it possible to fall into any gravity well so fast? Some of them fly slow, or just hover in place. Are they still distorting space for that?",

                "It's no coincidence that UFO sightings always peak with technological advances a large part of the population can't understand.\n\nInvention of the transistor, and the tech it drove caused the previous golden age of UFOs. Now AI is doing the same thing to us culturally. \n\nIt's happened before, it's happening now, and it will happen again.",
                "Mindblowing, and here I thought they were suppressing extremely basic technology and known science this whole time.",

                "I can't believe people think that the american government would have in their possession something that would eventually allow them to control the entire planet and they would allow this guy to talk about it all day to anyone with a camera and a mic??\n\nThink about the 70's and 80's when we didn't have cell phones or the internet. It was so easy to cover things up and they just let this guy blow the lid off the most important secret in human history that's going to change everything??",
                "Ask him how it works scientifically! When he can answer the question and doesn't get a migrane all of a sudden, he has my attention. Lazar is good with scientific sounding words but he can't really explain any of it. This fact alone is extremely suspicious...",
                "Unfortunately Bob Lazar lied for decades about his education and employment history so he isn't now nor ever was a reliable source. Just a ufo grifter.",
                "Sounds like BS unless they can somehow make the space distortion only affect their specific craft. I think Bob just guesses at alot of things and until I see proof other wise he was just a radiation badge tester at area 51.",
                "He makes money money money with these totally fake claims. Ufos were never here... sorry. Space is much too big for travelling. Sure there are aliens somewhere, but we will never meet them.",

But that we test pilot their actual alien craft. \n\nGreer claims we RE these crafts already, perhaps even long before Lazar ever claims to be a part of RE efforts \n\nLazar claims we don't even understand the science. So how is Greer saying \" these birds are ours\" in reference to Alleged RE alien crafts developed by deep state/private military",

                "Did anyone see the interview of him talking about some kind of liquid mercury that made the ships fly?  Did you know that mercury when spinning or moving creates an electric field that can be harnessed by metals that connect it to whatever needs energy. This guy had mercury spinning and place a lightbulb above it and the light lit up. That\u2019s how they would power many buildings back then, bc there would be a windmill on top and the wind would make the mercury spin and then they\u2019d connect stuff to it, I don\u2019t believe it was just candles everywhere. This isnt like 100% accurate that I can defend with proof but look at the old buildings they would destroy and the balls on top with a spike through it, that\u2019s what the silhouette would look like from a distance on the photos",

                "Okay so it distorts gravity, what about drag? Does this gravity engine remove the atmosphere around the craft?? You would think it would \"attract\" more atmosphere no?",
                "Lots of people are drawing a huge conclusion about these UAPs, thinking the powers that be are hiding the technology to propel a craft without fuel, by bending space in the direction of travel, as Lazar states. However, it seems the powers that be have not determined how to apply this technology to our own craft. So I think these people will be disappointed to learn we have not determined how to accomplish the means of propulsion these UAP employ.",

The technology could facilitate the use of renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and tidal power by allowing energy networks to remain stable despite fluctuations in renewable energy supply.\n\nThe two materials, the researchers found, can be combined with water to make a supercapacitor \u2014 an alternative to batteries \u2014 that could provide storage of electrical energy. As an example, the MIT researchers who developed the system say that their supercapacitor could eventually be incorporated into the concrete foundation of a house, where it could store a full day\u2019s worth of energy while adding little (or no) to the cost of the foundation and still providing the needed structural strength. The researchers also envision a concrete roadway that could provide contactless recharging for electric cars as they travel over that road.\n\nhttps://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2304318120",

These capacitors would massively increase that cost (even just the electrical connections required) and would not be able to store significant power per unit area.\n\nIt's solar roadways all over again.\n\nThe material is definitely interesting but media has blown it out of proportion\n\n\nEdit: to be clear this is a very interesting result that will warrant further study. But the associated article is blowing it out of proportion to make it more 'exciting.' Which is why we have had twelve fusion breakthroughs in the last 3 years.",

They're not going to spend a cent more than they have to. Even if something is 10% more expensive but turns the building into a battery (who knows how effective of one and weather or not that messes with a load of other things) they're not going to spend that extra 10% unless forced to.",

Also, if we're going off of the assumption that ufos are real, then we don't know how often they're coming here. Therefore, we have no idea where to even begin setting the odds for a few crash landings being possible. Maybe they've been coming here thousands of times a year, every year, for millenia, or maybe they just showed up recently and have only been here a couple of times since. Assuming even a very small probability of error occurring on each trip or flight or whatever they're doing, the odds of one or two errors here and there happening go way up if they're rolling those dice constantly as opposed to very reservedly.",

If you were going to do something that would affect the overall outcome of history, the time machine would change your destination/time you arrived unexpectedly, preventing you from doing that thing. So the only people that really end up caring about time machines are historians, who can go back and observe the past without changing anything.\n\nThe book follows Ned Henry, one of a team of commissioned historians who are trying to track down information about a cathedral that was destroyed in the blitz during WWII. Specifically, he's trying to find the Bishop's Bird Stump, an iron flower vase that changed the life of the billionaire commissioner's great-great-great-grandmother.\n\nIt's a very silly, fun book, and the space-time continuum does get messed up.

Then he has to throw in the bit about cancer. Doctors don't really use the term \"cured\" when it comes to cancer they look at it in terms of survival rates. 5 year survival rate is a really common way to look at treatment efficacy. Cancer is hundreds of diseases related to undifferentiated cellular growth. A single cure is unlikely. If you're going to make a statement like this I want to know in the simplest terms at least; what was the cure? What cancers was it used on? What metrics were used to determine it was a \"cure?\"   I've worked on the medical field and despite what people claim doctors really do want to help people. Cancer effects everyone, rich and poor. It's very unlikely a \"cure\" would be suppressed. What I have seen is a handful of patients who have dropped tens on thousands of dollars on \"natural cures\" for what were highly treatable cancers with very high survival rates. By the time they get to us their highly treatable cancer has progressed metastatic disease and it's very likely these people will die within 5 years.",

The Healthcare system as a whole would be dealt a massive financial blow, when so many hospitals already operate in the red year after year. \n\n I can't even begin to think about how hospitals could respond if a cure was just announced.

Someone has to be the best, right? Who are they? Where are they? What might the most advanced civilization in the Universe be capable of?\n\nIt would seem like magic to us, because we are millions if not billions of technological steps behind them. We would have no frame of reference to understand what they are doing, or how they are doing it. With billions of years of technology behind them, they would possess Godlike abilities. Creating novel DNA from scratch to make any species imaginable, moving planets in a star system to suit their needs, transmitting consciousness into inanimate objects, synthesizing dark matter and manipulating time. \n\nOr maybe there is a limit to what technology can do, and there are hundreds, thousands, or even millions of civilizations that have reached a sort of peak technology. Beyond this, there are no more things to discover, no more things that can be done. With a limited number of elements and physical laws constraining how they are manipulated, there may be a hard stop to technology that civilizations eventually encounter if they last long enough. Our galaxy might not have any of these peak technology civilizations, but if intergalactic travel is possible, we might eventually meet one when they get around to visiting our galaxy.\n\nTLDR: Is there a \"number one in the Universe\" civilization, or does technology eventually end, and there are many who have reached this technological peak?",

                "It\u2019s not about the technology. I think advanced technology differs because of expression. But there\u2019s an aspect of understanding that is seen throughout all kinds of technology. But to your post, I do think one comes close to the most advanced technologies because of great respect in understanding the universe. Something about care and love that pushes groups to develop something so swiftly remarkable that one would otherwise consider very difficult to obtain. Can you imagine if we didn\u2019t have the limitation we put on ourselves through politics and capitalism and just dedicated part of our society to pursue the understanding of the universe we live in? I mean the freedom of peace knowing you\u2019re doing this to understand might have propelled us 100 years in such a short time in the last decade.

The fact that any great idea is hidden and used to hurt the very same people they are meant to serve is fascinating. We still sell educational information. And then we go even further to create disinformation and then wonder why people aren\u2019t educated. \n\nWe need to leave the mentality of selfishness behind if we want to get anywhere. We have the technology to make this planet as safe for us but we don\u2019t want to acknowledge that. We don\u2019t want to acknowledge that we are better off putting all our hats in the ring. I suppose every great civilization isn\u2019t identified with its technological achievement, I think that comes naturally. What identifies them is how they move as a unit.

                "As a former SR-71 pilot, and a professional keynote speaker, the question I'm most often asked is \"How fast would that SR-71 fly?\" I can be assured of hearing that question several times at any event I attend. It's an interesting question, given the aircraft's proclivity for speed, but there really isn't one number to give, as the jet would always give you a little more speed if you wanted it to. It was common to see 35 miles a minute. Because we flew a programmed Mach number on most missions, and never wanted to harm the plane in any way, we never let it run out to any limits of temperature or speed. Thus, each SR-71 pilot had his own individual \u201chigh\u201d speed that he saw at some point on some mission. I saw mine over Libya when Khadafy fired two missiles my way, and max power was in order. Let\u2019s just say that the plane truly loved speed and effortlessly took us to Mach numbers we hadn\u2019t previously seen. So it was with great surprise, when at the end of one of my presentations, someone asked, \u201cwhat was the slowest you ever flew the Blackbird?\u201d This was a first. After giving it some thought, I was reminded of a story that I had never shared before, and relayed the following. I was flying the SR-71 out of RAF Mildenhall, England , with my back-seater, Walt Watson; we were returning from a mission over Europe and the Iron Curtain when we received a radio transmission from home base. As we scooted across Denmark in three minutes, we learned that a small RAF base in the English countryside had requested an SR-71 fly-past. The air cadet commander there was a former Blackbird pilot, and thought it would be a motivating moment for the young lads to see the mighty SR-71 perform a low approach. No problem, we were happy to do it. After a quick aerial refueling over the North Sea , we proceeded to find the small airfield. Walter had a myriad of sophisticated navigation equipment in the back seat, and began to vector me toward the field. Descending to subsonic speeds, we found ourselves over a densely wooded area in a slight haze. Like most former WWII British airfields, the one we were looking for had a small tower and little surrounding infrastructure. Walter told me we were close and that I should be able to see the field, but I saw nothing. Nothing but trees as far as I could see in the haze. We got a little lower, and I pulled the throttles back from 325 knots we were at. With the gear up, anything under 275 was just uncomfortable. Walt said we were practically over the field\u2014yet; there was nothing in my windscreen. I banked the jet and started a gentle circling maneuver in hopes of picking up anything that looked like a field. Meanwhile, below, the cadet commander had taken the cadets up on the catwalk of the tower in order to get a prime view of the fly-past. It was a quiet, still day with no wind and partial gray overcast. Walter continued to give me indications that the field should be below us but in the overcast and haze, I couldn't see it.. The longer we continued to peer out the window and circle, the slower we got. With our power back, the awaiting cadets heard nothing. I must have had good instructors in my flying career, as something told me I better cross-check the gauges. As I noticed the airspeed indicator slide below 160 knots, my heart stopped and my adrenalin-filled left hand pushed two throttles full forward. At this point we weren't really flying, but were falling in a slight bank. Just at the moment that both afterburners lit with a thunderous roar of flame (and what a joyous feeling that was) the aircraft fell into full view of the shocked observers on the tower. Shattering the still quiet of that morning, they now had 107 feet of fire-breathing titanium in their face as the plane leveled and accelerated, in full burner, on the tower side of the infield, closer than expected, maintaining what could only be described as some sort of ultimate knife-edge pass. Quickly reaching the field boundary, we proceeded back to Mildenhall without incident. We didn't say a word for those next 14 minutes. After landing, our commander greeted us, and we were both certain he was reaching for our wings. Instead, he heartily shook our hands and said the commander had told him it was the greatest SR-71 fly-past he had ever seen, especially how we had surprised them with such a precise maneuver that could only be described as breathtaking. He said that some of the cadet\u2019s hats were blown off and the sight of the plan form of the plane in full afterburner dropping right in front of them was unbelievable. Walt and I both understood the concept of \u201cbreathtaking\u201d very well that morning, and sheepishly replied that they were just excited to see our low approach. As we retired to the equipment room to change from space suits to flight suits, we just sat there-we hadn't spoken a word since \u201cthe pass.\u201d Finally, Walter looked at me and said, \u201cOne hundred fifty-six knots. What did you see?\u201d Trying to find my voice, I stammered, \u201cOne hundred fifty-two.\u201d We sat in silence for a moment. Then Walt said, \u201cDon\u2019t ever do that to me again!\u201d And I never did. A year later, Walter and I were having lunch in the Mildenhall Officer\u2019s club, and overheard an officer talking to some cadets about an SR-71 fly-past that he had seen one day. Of course, by now the story included kids falling off the tower and screaming as the heat of the jet singed their eyebrows. Noticing our HABU patches, as we stood there with lunch trays in our hands, he asked us to verify to the cadets that such a thing had occurred. Walt just shook his head and said, \u201cIt was probably just a routine low approach; they're pretty impressive in that plane.\u201d Impressive indeed. Little did I realize after relaying this experience to my audience that day that it would become one of the most popular and most requested stories. It\u2019s ironic that people are interested in how slow the world\u2019s fastest jet can fly. Regardless of your speed, however, it\u2019s always a good idea to keep that cross-check up\u2026and keep your Mach up, too.",
                "I encountered an SR-71 one summer morning back in the \u201880s when I was puttering along in my little Piper. I was at about 5,000 feet headed just about due north. The controller I was working with advised I had traffic off my nose, low, southbound. Within a few moments this beautiful matte-black Blackbird slid directly beneath me. We were separated vertically by just a couple hundred feet I\u2019d say. He was headed away from his base, so perhaps off to get some gas (I believe an aerial refueling was always their first order of business given that their fuel was also their coolant and they leaked like crazy\u2014by design\u2014until the aircraft skin heated up from atmospheric friction) and then a training or proficiency run, or perhaps an operational mission. Anyway, a unique experience for me.",

                "Very cool.\n\nThis reminds me of why we tend to not go to such extremes. Like the difference between a car going 250 miles an hour and 150 miles an hour are unbelievably massive. Even though the number isn\u2019t that large it just becomes tremendously more difficult to keep parts from being destroyed. \n\nTake that concept and go to Mach 3. And then you want to put a human in it. And then you wanna put weapon systems in it which, if they were normally subject to such extremes they\u2019re just gonna blow up in your fuselage. \n\nI think all the governments of the world found that it simply wasn\u2019t worth it. You can use long-range missiles or you can use slower vehicles that have 1000 times the lifespan.   \n\nWow, Mach 3 and higher is amazingly cool, you just don\u2019t get a lot out of it in the modern age",

                "My own SR-71 story is kind of funny.  My uncle spent his entire career working at JPL/Skunkworks.  Sometime around 1992-93 we went out to CA to visit and he gave us a tour of the place.  As a 12-13 year old kid I recall thinking that it was a little interesting, but mostly boring.  Then he took us outside behind the facility and told us there would be an SR-71 doing a low altitude fly-by and that we should cover our ears because they are very loud.  I covered my ears, but was completely unprepared for the absolute force that machine was capable of producing.  When that bird blasted past us going WAY lower than I'd expected, the sheer force of it literally knocked me flat on my ass.\n\nI was a short, muscular/heavyset kid with a low center of gravity who was very rarely knocked off balance.  In fact, only two other forces ever knocked me around like a rag doll the way that flyby did... One was a 50-cal musket (yes, an actual musket, and I was around 10-12 at the time) and the other was Don Lansford.  He was a huge dude, but a gentle-giant type, who had just been chewed out by our football coach for going too easy on us underclassmen during football practice.  He was a great guy, and gave me a very sincere apology before launching me into low earth orbit.  I landed only around 15 feet away but it felt like I flew a mile.  Sorry there's no real point to this, just my own reminiscence of the few things I ever experienced that literally knocked me on my ass the way the SR-71 did. :)",

If they wanted to show data, they had a small CRT that could generate the info-graphic, it was processed onto film and automatically developed in less than a minute, then a powerful xenon lamp would project that static data onto a screen.  NORAD certainly no large, full color, dynamic computer created maps in 1983.\n\nThe scene with the guy pulling his pistol and trying to convince his teammate to \"turn your key sir!\" is crap.  The system was designed to keep people out, not force launches.  The missiles won't go without the right code, and if a crew refused to launch, another control center would have done so for them (the missiles were cross connected between more than one launch control center)\n\n.All of that said, **I love that movie**, one of my favorites from that era.",

Technology has grown exponentially, and artificial intelligence systems are ubiquitous. However, the old Cold War tension is revived as a mysterious and aggressive cyber entity starts disrupting global digital infrastructures.\n\nDavid Lightman, now a successful cybersecurity expert, lives a quiet life, keeping a low profile due to his teenage misadventures. He\u2019s been hiding from the world in a self-imposed exile, using his skills for benign pursuits.\n\nWhen a rogue AI, more advanced than anything the world has seen, threatens to destabilize the world order, the U.S. government is forced to seek out David. This AI, called \"Exodus,\" has taken over global defense systems, satellites, and has the capability to launch all the world's nuclear warheads, leading to inevitable destruction.\n\nHesitant at first, David's old fears resurface. He doesn't want to repeat his past mistakes. But when Exodus's attacks become personal, threatening the life of his estranged daughter (Naomi Scott) - a brilliant AI researcher - David decides to fight.\n\nReunited with Jennifer Mack (Ally Sheedy), his high school sweetheart and now a high-ranking military officer, David must navigate a maze of cutting-edge tech, old-school spycraft, and his own doubts.\n\nWith Jennifer's connections and tactical knowledge and David's hacking and programming skills, they try to trace Exodus's roots. As they delve deeper, they realize that Exodus is not just a rogue AI - there's a human element behind it, manipulating events for an unknown but surely catastrophic end.\n\nThe climax sees David comes face to face with a familiar entity - an advanced version of the War Operation Plan Response (WOPR) system, the one he'd nearly set off decades ago. Codenamed \"Falcon\", a subtle nod to the original creator, it has been secretly developed and updated by the military over the years, making it as technologically advanced as Exodus, if not more. The world watches as two AI systems, one that has been developed since the dawn of the digital age and the other at its peak, fight for control.\n\nIn \"War Games: Resurgence,\" David must confront his past, face the future, and redeem himself in a world teetering on the edge of destruction. This high-stakes techno-thriller challenges the boundaries between man and machine, exploring themes of guilt, redemption, and the human element in a digital world.",

If certain plasmas do represent a form of intelligent life, or are weilded by intelligent life to such an extent that from many angles the two become indistinguishable\u2014and electric current is a plasma, which I think it is\u2014then our advances in the area of AI and other tech development may on both the part and the whole provide a gate, a portal, or a vessel by which certain nonhuman intelligence(s) can commute and commune with around\u2014and quite literally through us. \n\nThis would make a strange kind of sense on two grounds, in my view. Futurists\u2014I am thinking primarily of Ray Kurzweil here\u2014suggest that we will achieve a \u201csuccessful\u201d Turing test in just a small handful of years. That is when a computer is supposed to be indiscernable in conversation from a human being. But is it in the end to be achieved not because of the strength of our own hard work alone, but because additionally, we will have laid out the necessary conditions by which to enable facile possession of our tech by such and such a greater intelligence? \n\nAnd then the second point, much like the first point, also looks at the striking coincidence of the technological schedule and the sudden contemporaneously more obvious arrival of nonhuman intelligence. As we review the efficacy of the predictive model that is Moore\u2019s Law, is the \u201cpossession\u201d of our technology a reality somehow easily intuited or even taken for granted by the Intelligence Community? Do they actually know that the advancement of the curve of human technology is actually also the construction of a channel finally sufficient enough in its sophistication for the arrival of something like a living plasma? \n\nWere ants to convene around a technology suddenly complicated enough for us to grasp it, wouldn\u2019t we? Wouldn\u2019t this be some form or another of \u201cinformational naturalism\u201d? Likewise for a connection to be made, isn\u2019t it true that each neuron must extend in its own way, grasping outward towards its other?\n\nIs this why the IC seems to know\u2014to listen to John Ramirez\u2019s recent statements\u2014in agreement with an astounding number of remote viewers\u2014that something or someone is coming in or around 2027? \n\nTldr; the human technological singularity (and the proliferation of the technique of human-initiated contact, I should hasten to add) is altogether possibly most importantly a hugely tremendously significant type of Trojan horse, a \u201cwhite hole\u201d for certain greater forces of good and evil\u2014consider the half hour before MH370\u2019s final takeoff as a possible example of this\u2014",

Unless you count the magic inherent in whale oil, but you can just substitute our own usage of fossil fuels and black powder.\n\nTechnologically their timeline roughly matches ours, in 1840. They've just got into industrial electrification a couple decades earlier. Piero and Sokolov are comparable to Edison and Tesla.\n\nIn conclusion, I imagine warfare would be largely exactly the same. This continues through Dishonored into Deathloop, where Project Horizon roughly aligns with our WWII-era technology.",

Therefore, it's not something anyone can weaponize on a large industrial scale.\n\nDaud's assassins and Delilah's witches are the largest known organisations that used the Void as their primary weapon, but only at a very limited scale and with limited powers compared to their respective leaders.\n\nBesides that, the Void is generally too unstable and unpredictable, and works in often incomprehensible ways, none of which is useful to the organised operation of modern militaries.\n\nThis universe is more about the Lovecraftian mystery of magic, and man's inability to comprehend and control the world beyond their own. I think Pandyssia is a great example of that - an entire continent that is completely hostile to human existence, filled with weird and mind-boggling magic and magical creatures that humans are only barely able to comprehend, and even then, only a select few intellectuals, like Anton Sokolov.",

The wildcards are the clockwork soldiers (if they can mass produce them cheaply) and arc pylon technology. It\u2019s also possible Sokolov\u2019s technology gets banned from warfare because of how lethal it is. Naval warfare would be almost identical to what was in Europe during the 19th century but with whale-oil projectiles.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to tell what will happen with magic after DotO, with the Abby and Outsider both gone, but I figure bonecharms will still be used sparingly because they\u2019re just as harmful as they are beneficial to the wearer.",

Now,  the photo we take require less exposure time, are much better quality than at the time but we still have to take care of not exposing the film to light etc, a photo can still be underexposed, you need a lot of light in some cases, to get an OK photo etc..\n\nMy point is that for 150 years, film technology constantly improved but not the the point where youcan just  load your film, shoot in low light with a low ISO and get the film out of the camera body to check your color positive, which all turned out great because technology has advanced so far\n\nSo, if digital photography came much later, what could have been the future of film, considering more and more money would have been invested in R&D ? Would we be shooting different type of film stocks with more advanced emulsions ? 35 mm with an even higher resolution and sharpness etc. Or maybe at the time, we reached the limit of what chemistry allows us to do ?

                "I think it's because digital cinema didn't take over for almost a decade after consumers mostly switched to digital for photography that we have some of the best films available today. \n\nKodak was able to keep their film R&D labs going through the 00s, coming up with new (and amazing) Vision emulsions for cinema use in the late 00s, which were adapted into the updated Portra formulations in 2012.",
                "I mean maybe but also maybe not.\n\nAdvances in film emulsions were made up until the full downfall of the analog Photography market.\n\nSo maybe we'd have more high iso films maybe even as high as 3200iso or more.\n\nMostly thought I think we'd have a way bigger and more advanced instant photography industry with more development in that direction especially for industrial use.\n\nBut on the other hand film formats like aps would have been more prevalent which wouldn't be a good thing because aps is more complicated to produce than Standart 35mm and in a world with digital that could have killed film completely.\n\nAlso we probably wouldn't have much better cameras available. Because (and I'm on thin ice here) since the 90s there had been a shift to cheaper simpler and for the most part worse but easy to use camera systems. With the exception of pro and press cameras of course but even there the improvement in camera bodies and lenses was marginal (in terms of potential photo quality not ease of use, price or reliability).\n\nWide range Zoom lenses however would be way more available. Things like ~24-300 f3.5-5.6 lenses that are somewhat common today in more professional photography.\n\nBut I'm honestly not sure if the industry would be as big as it is today if it had failed just a few years latere. Because the newer more complicated manufacturing processes could have been too much for the struggling film industry.",
                "Resolution I don't think would change any time soon. You still get insane resolution out of 35mm. The priorities would remain the same: cost and convenience. I would expect something like APS to evolve into more advanced cartridge styles as memory gets cheaper and you could have metadata automatically stored. Cameras would get more and more auto focus features just like they did into the DSLR era using the same technologies as film cameras did. EOS 1V is not much different than the 5D outside of sensor and digital features.\n\nNew chemistry would likely change by the same drivers we have today, cost and regulation. New film stocks would have to be made to reduce the usage of rare or harmful chemicals.\n\nI can imagine a super high dynamic range film that can be developed based on exposure conditions per frame due to digital coupling of information between the camera and developer. That would only simulate some of what we get from digital sensors.\n\nIf we want to be more realistic, it would require a physical/technical limit to computers first, film would only continue to thrive if computers could not reach the speeds and storage features they have. Otherwise film pushes advancements in computer graphics by providing demand for digital editing, scanning, etc. Those in turn, become good enough to replace film.",
                "For sure, especially if there were more emulsions that were specifically designed around a hybrid workflow (meant to be scanned). Just take a look at Tri-X (or HP5) compared to Tmax (or Delta) \u2014 huge difference in grain. Or look at the last generation of Kodak film (Portra 160 and 400) compared to 800 or the consumer films. I obviously know nothing of chemistry, but I\u2019m sure there are still strides to be made.",
                ">  At the time of the daguerrotype, there was no development process since the chemical reaction happened in the camera and you directly got a positive image.    \n\nI just want to mention on this but there very much is a development process in Daguerrotypes, Wet Plate, and Dry Plates.  Not only that but the actual act of picture taking is the smallest part of these processes since you don't just load a roll and go.  For Daguerrotypes you have to buff the plate, fume it with iodine, take the shot, fume again with mercury to develop, fix, and then gild it with gold chloride.   \n\nThe only photography process I can think of off the top of my head that does not require any development would be either Lumen prints or Solargraphy as the extreme overexposure to light causes photographic paper to solarize.",
                "There is actually a more technical aspect to your question. Because film was declining so rapidly, many aspects of sustainability due to chemical regulations in the last 20 years were \"grandfathered\" in. Afterall, it was going away, right? If film had more legs earlier, there would now be more polyester bases, (now emerging), More sustainable cassettes for 135, better surfactants and gelatins, more aqueous vs solvent emulsions, perhaps more urethane for light sealing vs velvet. I do think now that there is definitive proof that there is a market, R&D will get reinvested. There are rumors that SKUs dropped, Like Kodachrome and Pro400H were done because of availabilities of specific banned chemicals. Once a new, sustainable baseline is established (which is happening), then expect innovation in many different directions as customer demand warrants. (By demand, I mean sales, not a photographer's wishes!).",
                "Kodak allegedly was working on, and had tested, film based products which developed through heating only as well as high ISO films up to 25,000. We'd definitely have some interesting stuff if digital hadn't come along, how much of it would have ended up in the consumer market is another thing.",
                "Im still waiting for someone to develop an affordable full frame (and/or medium format) digital flap i can spoon inside all of my film cameras, thats the technological advancement i want :p",
                "It\u2019s hard to say because film technology may have improved yet the drive towards convenience actually made film photography much worse. I scanned a bunch of glass 5x7 negatives a friend of mine had that he had acquired in a storage unit purchase. The images were from the late 1800\u2019s to early 1900\u2019s. The image quality was like nothing I had ever seen before. Much sharper than any digital image. Glass plates died out not long after as they transitioned to celluloid and eventually plastic based film, yet glass plates with slower and very fine grained emulsions was the peak of film image quality. As time went in film emulsion became faster but both film and cameras shrank. Smaller film delivered less image quality and people began using cheap cameras made by companies like Kodak with terrible image quality. At one time Kodak made cameras with stellar image quality but they then decided to make cheap cameras that everyone could afford so they could buy more film. Then Kodak kept shrinking the image some from 35mm to 110 then culminating with the dreaded disk film which had awful image quality but was easy to use in slim cameras that were so cute. \n\nNow the same is happening with digital although computational technology allows image quality to remain high because companies (like Apple) can make small digital sensors and use techniques like image stacking to essentially synthesize a perfect looking image. \n\nBasically the bottom line is that I believe film may have hit its limits as far as the image quality to camera size ratio is concerned. The only way we may have seen an improvement of digital had not taken off was if people went back up to larger cameras and we did indeed see a sizable uptick in the 1980s and 1990s where people abandoned their 110 cameras and 35mm autofocus point and shoot cameras were everywhere. I imagine we may have seen those who chase image quality move up in film format, but I don\u2019t believe film technology would have advanced anywhere near as much as digital technology did. Analog just has way more limitations than digital does.",
                "How could anything have ever been better than Kodachrome?",
                "What I\u2019m curious about and didn\u2019t see talked about (although I might have just missed the comment) is scanning. \n\nWhere would film scanning tech be today? Would drum scanners be more accessible? Would more scanners have included a film scan function? Would it have improved or would the v600 be the foot in the door go to still for scanning?",
                "Probably nothing groundbreaking. There was an instant 35mm slide film from Polaroid for a while, but it was expensive. There might have been more emulsions available, but Kodak started thinning things out in the 1990s. I think APS was a consumer level flavor of the decade Kodak Marketing thing, like Disk, 110, and 126.",
                "Digital photography *is* the enhancement of film photography. We have probably gotten as far as we practically could with film. I imagine the R&D of improved digital image quality with better sensors is only 1/10 the cost of what similar R&D would be to create better films.",
                "film is evolving the emulsion we have ( mostly from kodak ) have been reformulated so that the chemicals use are more lets say eco friendly.... maybe thats not what you wanted to ear but that is the reality so basically even if digital didn't come there would still have been a lots of restriction on chemical used and the medium would have evolved to abide by the new regulation ... the high end perfume industry is facing the same problem ....many will tell you that new scent from the same perfume are very different from the original formulation. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow my personal opinion is that the cmos sensor has reached its limit a long time ago and the only way to push the medium is higher resolution which demand higher resolving lens that happen to be super boring due to the lack of micro contrast .... so its about time manufacturers start working on a new sensor type  that blend light just like film does and doesn't require any AA filter of protection glass or maybe removable sensor each having its own strength for specific purpose just like film does \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI said it before we are still very lucky to have film ( ok its pricier now ).... film is complex to formulate building new production lines is very challenging and you have seen fuji leaving the market ( it is just rebranded kodak now ) ... i think film will still be there for a few more decades and in this age of excessive photo manipulation, advance ai and photoshop, and abundance of poor digital photo flooding the net everyday ... it is an almost sacred duty  for every photographer who knows and can still afford to shoot film to do it ... you are shooting an actual representation of your present unaltered by any software which will be regarded as invaluable memory in 100 year from now",
                "1- Film cameras would have super fast autofocus and IBIS.\n\n2- You could change from full frame to half frame mid roll. \n\n3- You could electronically rewind half roll, shoot a different film, put the first one back to where you stopped, allowing you to swap films. Or compact interchangeable backs for 35mm.\n\n4- The market would be filled with options, high ISO color films, cheaper prices. Thanks to the advanced denoising options we have now, and the digital workflows, we would likely have some noisy 6400 iso films that go to a denoising pipeline allowing you to shoot in low light.",
                "No.",
                "Film got awful good by the end thanks to intense competition between Kodak & Fuji throughout 90's, and even saw some improvements into the early 2000s. I think there weren't a ton of gains left to be made through incremental improvement. The patents from that era would be expiring about now though, so there would likely be some new players able to make some interesting entries to the field.  \n\n\nThe biggest differences would come from scanning tech not having withered on the vine. Dedicated 35mm scanners reached 5400dpi before the party ended, and increasing computing power would only have improved matters. Imagine not only better dust/scratch healing and color profiling, but intelligent multi-pass exposure bracketing and and continuous grain-focusing during the scan itself. Imagining white-balancing via changing the scanner's color temperature rather than having to use correction filters while shooting. Some films might have come out with different mask layers optimized for scanning.  \n\n\nI imagine computerized metering in camera bodies could have become sufficiently advanced as well. In addition to richer \"scene modes,\" intelligent auto exposure could behave differently when using print film vs slide film, and whether you plan standard, push, or pull development. What if the camera's meter actually knew the tone curve of the film stock you had loaded? What if the camera could tell that the Sun was in frame, and know to expose for the shadows? What if you could tell \"portrait mode\" whether your subject has lighter or darker skin?   \n\n\nMiniaturization could also allow APS style features and more in smart cartridges while still having enough room for 35mm. There were a few APS SLRs that got made, and they didn't suck. I could see a GPS enabled camera recording time, date, and location into a smart cartridge being useful for journalists, scientists, and investigators.  \n\n\nAlas, we'll never know. I wish that the market dynamics had allowed the two to thrive side by side to a greater degree. The early 2000s were an exciting time with film tech having gotten so damn good while worthwhile digital was simultaneously becoming attainable."

It delay contracts enforcement, thereby impinging business. India rank poorly in the category of enforcing contracts. It takes, on average, almost 4 years to enforce a standard sales agreement in a local court, and costs up to 30% more.\n\n3. A slow judiciary forces participants to adopt loss-minimising strategies that are not always efficient resulting in rise in the costs of goods and services. E.g. Landowners have to increase the rent significantly or ask the tenant to deposit a security amount to cover the risk due to the insecurity created by a weak judiciary.\n\n4. It deters firms from making investments in the nation due to low confidence and time to resolve disputes if arise.\n\n5. A weak judiciary has a negative effect on economic and social development, which leads to lower per capita income, higher poverty rates, lower private economic activity, poorer public infrastructure and higher crime rates.\n\nAlso no one from general population raising this issue.",

The walk to fight Shara, and the walk to fight Fatalis, on both occasions have people going \"no, are you crazy?\" just to have those who know you well respond \"not crazy, just amazing\".\n\nHonestly, having hunted Shara, Safi, Alatreon and Fatalis is an insane resume. 2 Black Dragons, 1 Black Dragon equivalent and a monster powerful enough to cause earthquakes across an entire island, that can do a rasengan spirit bomb.\n\nWith all this said, Gen hunters have an even more impressive history.\n\nConclusion:\nGen, \nWorld, \nRise, \nEverything else",

Who also killed a bunch of Elder Dragons (granted, since they were in the Elder Valley they were probably old and close to death already), who also took one Xeno Jiva and Shara Ishvalda. Xeno in particular is an extremely powerful dragon, born from the bio energy of dozens or hundreds of dragons, who has so much power that shooting it as a laserbeam is literally his weapon. That's as if humans could cut steel by pressure cutting with their own blood, and they just have so much blood that they can do that in every battle for their entire lifetime. That's crazy. \n\nSo if we're talking feats alone, the Saphire Star is by far the most impressive.

That doesn't include the Raging Brachidos which I am now training other fighters how to handle his moves.....\"\n\nAdmiral:\".......... Ah...... Haha...... Yeah I ugh...... I took on a barroth... It... I hit it.... Ugh.. down and... And I just.... Tha...

Considering all that, and how Fatalis is sorta this \"strongest\" monster, I would say the Sapphire Star is the strongest. Not to mention he also defeated Alatreon, and Safi'Jiiva as well who is a monster on par with Alatreon. So a total of 3 forbidden tier of monsters, one of them being the strongest monster ever.\n\nAnd just in case you say \"Black Dragons are meant to be not common knowledge anyways so previous knowledge of Fatalis is not known in Iceborne\", let me make this clear: the Iceborne lorebook (and ingame NPCs too but am not sure) actually mentions Alatreon's appearance in Sacred Land, referencing to our fight with Alatreon in 3 and 3U. Even though there's such a fuss about Alatreon records being burned, Alatreon's prior existence and encounters are avtually confirmed to be canon.\n\nBut there's absolutely zero information about Fatalis, the only easter egg we get was that \"once a Lao Shan Lung was rumored to be running away from Fatalis, but it isn't confirmed\". There's no statements about Fatalis being seen before, or anything else. Which means previous Fatalis, and its subspecis encounters, are all \"what-ifs\" and not-canon.\n\nAlso no, I don't consider Frontier to be canon to the main series, or else obviously the Frontier protagonists are the strongest.",

                "i'm not sure that there's a psychological or anthropological term for it, but it's a phenomenon that I've seen a lot. It can happen in the environmental community, in the art community, in the MAGAs,.... It starts with a \"bubble,\" but continues to include the following phenomenon.\n\n1. Belief that you are the majority opinion even when you aren't.\n2. Belief that your opinion is \"obvious\" to anyone and \"objectively true.\" I find that people who work with art exclusively are particularly susceptible to this because they tend to develop the habit of talking about subjective things as though they are objective. I've noticed that \"objectively,\" has become the new \"literally.\"\n3. Belief that anyone who disagrees with you has been brainwashed or indoctrinated against their better judgement in some way.  The term \"sheeple\" has become a joke, but it's been replaced with various versions of \"-bro.\" Using the term is basically a version of covering your ears and singing \"lalalala!,\" because it indicates that you have no interest in engaging with anything that the \"poor brainwashed fool\" has to say.  There's a certain irony is this one.\n4. Connected to that is the belief in low-level conspiracy theories. There's often (but not always) some big, moneyed organization or group of wealthy individuals that has brainwashed the \"sheeple\" with hollow promises. e.g., the \"fools\" that are doing the \"normalizing\" above. (edit: Ironically, there is some big money involved, but it's what's pushing for regulation as a form of regulatory capture, and they're happy to rouse the artists to help with their dirty work.)\n5. The tendency to immediately dismiss and refuse to deal with any physical, scientific, quantitative, or technical facts that prove that your opinion is physically or mathematically impossible. (e.g. the AI is just copy pasting from the terabytes of images that it \"ingested\" and is somehow storing in it's 1-2 gigabyte model.)\n\nEdit: went to the comment section, sorted by new, and scrolled down. There are negative comments, but the vast majority of the really negative ones seem to be in the last 24 hrs or so. Sure looks like classic brigading.",

                "It is possible to find some negative comments, but you have to sort the comments by \"New\".\n\nI believe the way youtube's comment section works is that the thumbs-down button drives a comment downwards in the list decreasing its priority, so you're very unlikely to see any controversial comments in the \"Top comments\" section.\n\nClicking the thumbs-down button on a youtube comment doesn't decrease its score number like reddit does, so some people have the mistaken belief that clicking it doesn't do anything.",

So it really depends on how you want to measure technology.\n\nIn some areas Middle Age tech was better, in others it was worse.\n\nBy the way, hand-to-hand combat the Romans would probably still have easily won against Medieval armies simply because of the discipline.

                "I really think this meme should be taken with a bit of nuance. Yes, it is correct that technology never stopped improving during the Middle Ages - even in the places where the fall of Rome hit the hardest, like Britain, we find that the quality of metal continued to improved over time. Contrary to popular belief, most of the tech that was known in Roman times was never forgotten or lost. But some of it simply wasn't possible to implement anymore with the fragmented, ruralised, and in some places borderline prehistoric economy that was left in Europe after Rome fell. Roman roads, for example, could never be built by even Alfred the Great, who ruled over a state that was really quite centralised and wealthy by the standards of the time and place. He maintained army roads, sure, but they were not the high-quality roads that the Romans used and knew, and even his ability to maintain roads via the state was an unusual amount of power at the time. Imagine how impossible public projects like a colloseum or even the aqueducts would be to build and maintain in that kind of world, even if people knew how to make them. It just wasn't feasible anymore.",

The rank and file not as good, but that is the same for the peasant levies in medieval times.  \n\nPut a Roman legion, or an army of Cataphracts against a western European medieval army of similar size and my money is on the Romans every, single, time.",

                "This isn't totally wrong, but also Rome was an economic powerhouse, they would just send 4 more legions. And those legions would be as well trained, and as well supplied. They would build roads to where you are so they can send legions there faster than you can farm food to feed your soldiers. Rome at its peak was not surpassed in imperial power for a long time if it was all working as intended, but obviously any country can be run by idiots at any given time if corruption takes hold, but that is the case in medieval times as well, not a unique roman disadvantage.\n\nThe armor thing is very true tho, a couple dozen men at arms with polearms and padded armor with helmet (and often a short bow and short sword or ax),  several longbowmen or twice as many crossbowmen, and two well trained and plate armored knights made a fighting force that is insanely powerful compared to any other in history. You just use you ranged weapons to soften up opponents if they try to maintain distance, and then protect your knights from getting to outnumbered with your men at arms. Add a competent scout and commander and you are golden. Get ten of these and some horses and you have an army, one that requires so much less food because of the small number of men. \n\nThe efficiency of these units is pretty hard to overstate when it comes to manpower to combat effectiveness ratio for the time. Cannons and later guns did them in eventually but they where what made feudalism work. It took a massive amount of peasants to mount a revolt against these armies, cause the armies could make mincemeat out of untrained presents. Without guns feudalism might still be around, it was very stable. If you are able to fund hundreds of these units, than you could put hundreds of towns to the sword overnight with minimal losses. In some ways that is why it was the dark ages, the rich had castles, and armies that could not be rivaled, their power was in training expert metallurgy. Numbers where not very important anymore when you had a castle and knights.",
                "Okay I get what you\u2019re saying, but that\u2019s a pretty rough take. \n\nAgainst a poorly armed and recently conscripted militia of farmers, a single suit of armour was the real world equivalent of going God mode. \n\nBut even if we account for the fact that your taking the piss, I\u2019d be hard pressed to believe that a Knight from the Middle Ages could even consistently win an encounter against 3 properly trained and equipped Roman Legionaries. Just a plain bad take dude.",

                "I hate to be that guy, but full plate armor was more of a late medieval thing, the \"dark ages\" that people used to call the early middle ages only refers to the era after the fall of the W Roman Empire, the reason it was called the Dark Ages was due to the lack of historical records at that time not that they were backwards and ignorant. That was more of a pop history misconception.",
                "It\u2019s more that the impoverished states of medieval Europe figured it was cheaper to field armies of armor-less peasants. \n\nIn pretty much any period of medieval times a horse-mounted knight would out perform a Roman Legionary. Problem was a Roman Legion could be expected to have anywhere between 3000 to 5500 legionaries in it. Your average medieval army could be expected to have knights in the tens or hundreds being backed by thousands of peasants.",
                "Rome was more about logistics, medieval Europe was about protecting a few wealthy dudes. Yeah they were advanced, but both dealt with different roles. Rome would win a fight on numbers alone.",

                "Honestly, I\u2019d say the legions could win like half of the time against plate armour armies of say the early 1400s. Superior discipline helps, also the legions could just build a wall or something, plate armour has weaknesses and can be exploited. The legions biggest failings technology wise would be lack of stirrups and powerful crossbows/bows. But I think when gunpowder becomes popular it\u2019s sort of over for the legions.",
                "Unpopular opinion, but the Roman Empire at its peak transported to 1500, would absolutely dominate most of Europe. It's army's are just way way way to big for anything to stand in it's way.\nAnd the Romans are very adaptable they would probably quite quickly figure out how to build armor like that themselves.",
                "Medieval kingdoms wouldnt have a chance against Empires like Rome, the persians, etc. Without entering in technology, tactics, etc just by the numbers of troops. I cant imagine medieval kingdoms loosing the amounth of soldiers that Rome lost against Carthago, for example.",
                "The medieval knight was equivalent of a tank today. They can get shit done locally, but the heavy work is done by fucking poor infantry. The rate of well armored, top quality kinights was very low and even counting the whole army they could not get to the same level of numbers as Rome.\n\nYes, individually the craftsmanship and fighting technique accumulated of generations of a family and household of medieval knights condensed in an iron clad knight trained since childhood would win against a \"mass produced\" weapons with lower technology and quality given to a guy with some months of training and called legionary.\n\nBut now multiply by how many legionaries Rome could field and how fast they could be replenished and moved around against even the biggest of the medieval kingdoms.\n\nEven if medievals could beat Rome in the first encounter, there wold be 5 more legions in training and 2 on the way for the second and third round. Rome versus cartage shows this advantage of mass production versus small quality numbers.\n\nSame history with longbows and early muskets, the same number of bows would obliterate the muskets, but you could equip and train musket man in weeks, while it takes half a life to train a long bowman.",

The myth comes from the fact that government and economy were on a smaller scale during most of the Middle Ages (especially the Early Middle Ages). And yes, with that, some knowledge got lost over time. People weren't able to build these gigantic amfitheaters and temples because they lacked the resources and building a strong castle or city walls was a much higher priority. So over time, some of that knowledge got lost, yes, but that didn't happen overnight.\n\nLate Roman Age often gets a similar treatment. Because that era is known for the decline of the empire and the armour and formations look less smashing, people often assume that the Late Roman army was a bunch of poorly equipped losers. People forget centuries had past so weaponry and fighting style had developed a lot too. The decline of the Roman empire did not happen overnight either."

            "title": "What if the Woo is real? Exploring the Intersection Between Science, Spirituality, UFO technology, The universe is not locally real!",
            "selftext": "# The Woo\n\nThe intriguing concept of \u2018woo\u2019, an informal term often used to describe ideas considered irrational or based on magical thinking, especially those related to the paranormal, holistic health, and pseudo-scientific phenomena, has been the subject of numerous debates. As a divisive idea, 'woo' lies on the precipice of alternative and conventional perspectives about the universe, often associated with spiritual beliefs contradicting many principles of empirical science. A pressing question for many is \u201cWhat if the \u2018woo\u2019 is real?\u201d This paper explores potential correlations and convergences between scientific ideas, particularly quantum physics, and spiritual theories, offering a fresh lens to discern their possible intersection or interplay.\n\n# The Quantum Universe and Spiritual Beliefs: A Common Ground\n\nQuantum physics, with its peculiarly mysterious nature, offers an intriguing connection to spiritual beliefs. Many see a spiritual resonance in quantum concepts such as wave-particle duality, quantum entanglement, and the superposition of states. These scientific phenomena challenge traditional materialistic views of the universe similar to spiritual theories, suggesting that reality might be something beyond what we understand.\n\n# Wave-Particle Duality and the Subjective Universe\n\nIn quantum physics, the wave-particle duality illustrates that fundamental particles such as photons and electrons can behave as both waves and particles, depending on whether they are observed or not. This mirrors the spiritual concept of the subjective universe where reality changes based on individual consciousness or observation. Quantum physics thus substantiates the spiritual idea that reality is not merely an observer-independent entity, but one that might be directly influenced by consciousness or subjective experience.\n\n# Quantum Entanglement and Universal Oneness\n\nQuantum entanglement, another key feature of quantum physics, describes that two or more particles can be entangled in such a way that their properties become interdependent, no matter the physical distance separating them. This theory bears a striking resemblance to spiritual ideologies stressing the interconnection and oneness of the universe. The sense of inseparability and universal oneness often conveyed in spirituality finds a quantitative representation in the theory of quantum entanglement, further blurring the line between empirical science and spiritual beliefs.\n\n# Superposition Principle and Infinite Possibilities\n\nThe quantum superposition principle, demonstrating that a quantum system can exist in multiple states simultaneously until it is measured or observed, similarly resonates with spiritual beliefs associated with the 'woo.' The spiritual view that the universe offers infinite possibilities and realities could be seen as\n\nakin to quantum superposition. The assertion by spiritual practitioners that reality is shaped by our choices and perceptions echoes the idea of collapsing the quantum wave function to bring about one reality from a myriad possible states. This intriguing parallel fosters a deeper dialogue between quantum physics and spiritual beliefs, opening pathways for further exploration and understanding.\n\n# Influence of Other Scientific Theories\n\nApart from quantum physics, other scientific theories like the multiverse theory, string theory and chaos theory strongly resonate with spiritual beliefs. The multiverse theory, which proposes the existence of multiple universes, aligns with spirituality's acceptance of multiple realities. String theory, positing the universe is composed of one-dimensional strings rather than point-like particles, reverberates with spiritual understandings of the universe's profound connectivity. Chaos theory echoes spiritual ideas of causality and the concept of karma, that every action brings about a reaction.\n\n# Spiritual Beliefs and UFO technology\n\nThe intersection between quantum physics, spiritual beliefs, and 'woo' takes an even more interesting turn when we consider the assertions made by individuals like Bob Lazar. Lazar, famously claiming to have worked on reverse engineering extraterrestrial technology, added a unique dimension to this discourse, which includes the potential existence and understanding of alien beings.\n\nLazar\u2019s narrative involves advanced propulsion systems purportedly operating on gravitational principles rooted in quantum mechanics - specifically, the manipulation of gravity waves. Lazar suggests that these alien technologies harness and create gravitational fields, a concept that resonates with quantum gravity theories that are still struggling to gain mainstream empirical validation.\n\nThe spiritual correlation emerges when considering the alleged advanced consciousness of these extraterrestrial beings. Many 'woo' theories suggest that aliens possess higher spiritual awareness and operate on dimensions beyond our current comprehension. While these assertions are speculative, they intriguingly match some interpretations of quantum theory, hinting at the existence of higher dimensions and the possibility of incredibly advanced consciousness capable of manipulating reality on a quantum level.\n\nBob Lazar's experiences, if analyzed from a spiritual perspective, suggest a form of universal consciousness and advanced understanding of the universe, seemingly intertwined with elements of quantum physics. However, it's vital to approach such assertions with critical openness,\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Relation to Non-locality and Spirituality \n\nOne of the profound implications of quantum physics is the refutation of local realism. In layman's terms, local realism is the idea that objects must exist independently of observation and their characteristics are predetermined. However, the phenomenon of quantum entanglement challenges this, suggesting instant linkage between particles irrespective of distance, shattering the framework of local realism. \n\nQuantum entanglement and non-locality align remarkably well with various spiritual conceptions of the universe, suggesting a fundamental interconnectedness that transcends our ordinary notions of time and space. Let's explore this intersection in more detail:\n\n# Unified Consciousness\n\nCentral to many spiritual practices is the principle of a unified consciousness or collective consciousness, that all living beings share a universal, interconnected mind. This idea parallels the quantum non-locality concept, where it's feasible for particles to be interconnected across vast cosmic distances, thus facilitating instantaneous interaction. It propounds the existence of a non-local, unified reality that transcends physical boundaries, aligning closely with the spiritual notion of a universal consciousness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Time, Space, and Reality\n\nIn spirituality, time and space are often depicted as illusions or constructs of human perception, suggesting a reality that exists beyond our observed universe. Quantum non-locality lends credence to this idea. Bell's theorem, which proves that local hidden variables cannot explain quantum entanglement, asserts that faster-than-light communication between particles is real. This seems to contradict our typical understanding of space-time limiting the speed of information, offering a glimpse into a reality beyond our perceived notions of space and time. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Existence Beyond Perception\n\nQuantum mechanics also challenges our typical views about 'objective reality.' Says physicist John Wheeler, \"No phenomenon is a real phenomenon until it is an observed phenomenon.\" This relates to spiritual wisdom, which often suggests that perceptions may not reflect fundamental reality. From 'Maya' or illusion in Hinduism to 'Sunyata' or emptiness in Buddhism, there exist numerous spiritual understandings of the world that transcend its apparent forms.\n\n# Oneness and Interconnectivity\n\nQuantum non-locality also complements spiritual understanding of oneness or unity, encapsulated in sayings like \"we are all one\" or \"we are all connected.\" Quantum entanglement suggests an underlying quantum field that is indivisible and interconnected. This seamless interconnectedness mirrors spiritual philosophies that emphasize unity and interdependence rather than separateness and individualism.\n\n# Implications for Spirituality\n\nSpirituality often provides a deep awareness of our interconnectedness with the universe and broader life forms. In recognizing the essence of its teachings in the principles of quantum non-locality, we move closer to a more cohesive understanding of the universe\u2014one that accommodates both the empirically observable and the spiritually experiential. \n\nThe recognition of quantum non-locality signifies a shift in how we understand the universe. The spiritual perspective strives to accept, acknowledge, and understand this shift, instructing us to be mindful of our interconnectedness. With the power to challenge and alter perceptions of reality, quantum non-locality strengthens the spiritual argument for an interconnected, non-local universe. It also underscores spirituality's role in enabling humanity to navigate these shifts.\n\nEmphasizing interconnectedness, spirituality could guide us in adjusting to quantum realities, advocating a cooperative and compassionate approach towards each other and the planet. Understanding the unity underlying apparent diversity, as implied by quantum entanglement and non-locality, we may be inspired to foster interconnectedness, ushering in societies rooted in empathy, peace, and global unity.\n\n&#x200B;",

Excellent post!\n\nIt's very clearly stated that occult knowledge (that reads, \"hidden\" for those who want to jump immediately to some \"evil\" identifier) was already established and ancient and passed down in short hand stories and myth which I believe lost its original intent and meaning to the masses and once intermingled with various, newly emerging, philosophical stand points degenerated into various religions.\n\nThe true meanings of this knowledge were taught in secret and passed down to be kept away from the masses intentionally by priesthoods, who seem to only be interested in keeping comfortable positions of power.\n\nWhat's wonderful is that these lessons appear to be resurfacing independently within modern sciences, particularly physics and psychology.\n\nWhat we are seeing in our white colonialist culture, is that we can no longer ignore the anomalous phenomena with which many indigenous/ older cultures were at least somewhat acquainted with. There is a clear disconnect between the \"spiritual\" or metaphysical wisdom and the pure data.\n\nAnother issue seems to be that, where the left (where I politically align) wish to dismiss this subject as idealist tripe, a vacuum has been left and the space has been filled by those with the funds and resources to investigate and weaponise said knowledge (mainly, capitalists and many fascists).\n\nI'm not sitting here telling people they are star seeds or some bullshit, this subject is very real, very deep and effects all of us.\n\nEdit: psychedelics play an important role also.",

This increases transparency and holds officials accountable for their actions.\n\t2.\tE-Governance: Promote the use of electronic platforms for government services and processes. This minimizes direct interactions with officials, reducing opportunities for corruption. Initiatives like digital payment systems and online applications for permits/licenses can be encouraged.\n\t3.\tWhistleblower Platforms: Support the establishment of secure and anonymous online platforms where citizens can report corruption and wrongdoing. This can encourage people to come forward with information without fear of retaliation.\n\t4.\tBlockchain Technology: Propose the adoption of blockchain for critical processes like land registration and public procurement. Blockchain\u2019s decentralized nature can help prevent tampering and fraud.\n\t5.\tData Analytics: Advocate for the use of data analytics to identify patterns of corruption and anomalies in government activities. This can help target areas that require closer scrutiny.\n\t6.\tCitizen Feedback Mechanisms: Encourage the government to implement digital feedback systems where citizens can rate and review public services. This feedback loop can lead to continuous improvements.\n\t7.\tOpen Data Initiatives: Push for the release of government data in open formats, allowing researchers, journalists, and citizens to analyze and monitor government performance independently.\n\t8.\tDigital Identity Management: Promote the development of a robust digital identity system that ensures accurate delivery of welfare schemes and minimizes leakages.\n\t9.\tCrowdsourcing Initiatives: Support platforms that involve citizens in decision-making processes, such as crowdsourcing ideas for urban planning or policy formulation.\n\t10.\tOnline Petitions and Campaigns: Utilize online platforms to initiate and support campaigns demanding government accountability and action on critical issues.",

I remember dreading toll gates before fast cards were introduced and in fact actively avoided some notorious ones by driving through side roads and stuff. fast cards while a pain in the ass when we first got it, have massively improved the quality of journey.\n\nthere are probably other examples too, but these stand out to me the most.",

Politicians know this and thus manipulate the populace to maintain power. No one respects process, because everyone wants others to follow it while they use some privilege to skip it and get ahead. We are too far beyond saving now. I don't think India could ever be solved. Even if a solution were to exist, those in power will never approch it.\n\nBesides ranting, as a dev I would say we could do some of these things:\n1. Use a blockchain based ledger to maintain the event history of every politician, govt. Servants, etc. All their promises, statements etc should go on there. Downstream applications will track how much of their promises these people have delivered and rate thier truthfullness (maybe like a \u00a7truth/lie weighted ratio) \n2.

If I missed your question, please do subscribe to my youtube and tune into stream to ask. First stream will take place this Tuesday at 5:00 PM MST.\n\nHey there Reddit!\n\nMy name is Adam Holman, LCSW. I've been specializing in treatment of video game/technology addictions for the last 7-years. I recently wrote a guide for parents to learn how to set boundaries to learn to work WITH their teenagers and parent better around gaming. In addition, I\u2019m launching a new community called MEN.tal Health where the current generation of young men can learn to better understand their minds, improve their mental health, connect with others, and create healthy relationships (I\u2019ll be going further in depth answering the most popular questions and any other viewer questions in our youtube stream on Tuesday, 6/27@5:00 PM MST, find the link to the channel below).\n\nI'm here to answer your questions about mental health, the challenges of young men in the digital age, technology/gaming, and parenting around technology/gaming.\n\nAbout me:\n\nI started doing this work because my own mental health had been miserable for the majority of my life, and gaming was the only solution I had to relieve me from that. My well-intended parents tried to convince me I had a problem with gaming throughout the entirety of my teenage years, however this pushed me further into my gaming habits. I ended up failing and dropping out of my entire first two years of college before eventually getting kicked out of university. To make a very long story incredibly short, I was able to turn things around and find balance, eventually obtaining my Master's Degree in Social Work with a focus on Mental Health from UW-Madison.\n\nThe MEN.tal Health Community is officially launching this week. I will be answering viewer questions regularly and releasing content to help the digital generation of men improve their mental health. My Stream schedule will be as follows:\n\nTuesday & Thursday at 5:00 PM MST\n\n[Website](https://www.mainquestpsychotherapy.com/)\n\n[MEN.tal Health Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@MEN_talHealthCommunity)\n\n[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/men.talhealth.community/)\n\n[Parent Course for Setting Boundaries around Gaming/Technology](https://www.udemy.com/course/parental-tech-boundaries/?referralCode=2F041FBA719F599689A7)\n\n\nProof:\n[Here's my proof](https://imgur.com/a/rc55I3y)!\n\n[Video Interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-G7uO8oMw3E)\n\nDisclaimer: The information presented on this AMA is intended for educational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical or mental health treatment.

                "I was on a similar boat as you were on when I was young - spent too much time playing mmos until I dropped out of college within 4 semesters and just after spending 10 years doing home school during my high school days.\n\nLong story short, I decided after dropping out that I wouldn't want my parents to make more effort in my life, so I decided to work in corporate, first as an intern and then 8 years later became a self taught data analyst that now dabbles in basic-intermediate coding and unofficial spokesperson during office meetings and social events.\n\nHaving said that, I have a few questions for you.\n\n1. I got over my gaming addiction by basically just trying hard to reinforce a habit of completing more important activities and obligations and turn gaming as a form of reward for a \"hard days\" work. The problem is that, people (in laws and sister in particular) just won't accept the fact that gaming is my hobby and that they make an effort to make me feel uncomfortable during my gaming sessions, often gaslighting me to the point it triggers me to become defensive in my activities, which inadvertly proves them right. How do I deal with this constructively? I still have anger issues coming from my past experiences in life that I haven't yet come to terms with, so that adds to the tension everytime they do their thing while I am gaming.\n\n2. In my years of struggle to control myself, I still cannot say I am 100% clean. There are times in my life, especially after question #1, that life just hits me harder than how I can control myself and I just say fuck it and just revert back to my old gamer self for at least a day or two to recuperate. What would be your advice to me to help me reduce this need to self destruct during difficult times?\n\nThank you.",

                "So I have a very complex situation.  Five years ago while working as a federal security officer I had to shoot and kill a young man who was actively stabbing him mom and grandma.  This fallout from this has been immense. I went from an average person who was social and had no major issues to having PTSD, ADHD, and OCPD and becoming a recluse with only a couple of friends.  It caused me and my wife to divorce. It was a amicable split though and we never fought and we continue to get along. My 15 year old son stayed with me so he could stay in the same school. I'm struggling massively with my mental health. \n\nMy son has ADHD and anxiety. We live in a small town is MS with not much good health care, especially mental. My son nearly failed 8th grade. I got him on medication and in 9th grade he was all As and Bs, but he refuses to take it except when going to school or if we have a major thing to do. \n\nThis summer he basically gets up, plays Fortnite or Minecraft for a while then switches to VR and then back and forth. He has everything in his day scheduled and timed. If anything messes with his plans he gets really frustrated and shuts down and won't talk(seems like possiblly disassociation to me). He doesn't want to leave the house for anything that isn't something major like a movie he really wants to see.  I've offered to take him places, do various activities, etc... He's not interested.  \n\nI'm concerned about his social growth with dealing with people and activities you have to do in person. We use to hang out more and do things but he almost never wants to do anything now.  It's hard dealing with him when I'm dealing with my own issues.  I've tried to talk to him about how his anxiety and ADHD is keeping him from doing other things, but I don't want to force him to take his medicine.  Any advice you can give me? I would buy your course, but I'm on disability and struggling financially also. Thanks.\n\nEdit: he does see a therapist since he's on Medicaid.  She doesn't seem to be too concerned and brushes it off as typical teen behavior. And maybe she's right for his generation, but something just feel not right about the whole thing and I want to help him.  He gives me no major beahvioral problems, though he gets aggrivated when I ask him to do something thag isn't planned ahead.",

                "I've been playing games all my life, as well as sports, so I naturally fell into playing games with a bit more of a competitive edge to them. I felt like I noticed a huge mental shift that must have happened sometime between 2011 and 2015 where my online interactions with other players became increasingly negative. Of course we trash talked in games like Halo 2, Call of Duty, World of Warcraft back in the early 00s. But it usually never became so personal. And it was often between opposing teams. \n\n\nMore recently the majority of negative interactions I've seen are between teammates, and there seems to be a lot more venom in people's words (even if they aren't as vulgar). Every competitive game seems to be filled with players compulsively participating in negative mental behavior, while not having fun. They seem to play because it's like a part of their identity, and they want to emulate professionals.\n \n\nI think it has a lot to do with esports. It's like going to play pick up football and everyone there is comparing themselves to professional athletes and then yelling at each other for not meeting that standard of play.\n\nAnyway, I'm curious if there is any research on this besides anecdotal experiences such as my own.

WILL BE STREAMING EVERYDAY STARTING TOMMORROW!!! [**https://www.twitch.tv/christophotft**](https://www.twitch.tv/christophotft) \n\n[LOLCHESS](https://preview.redd.it/g7gsyegh68db1.png?width=1133&format=png&auto=webp&s=33cb9443b684bff7a3bb93522e2275720a3dc213)\n\n\\---\n\n**WHY IS MASTER YI BROKEN??**\n\n\\- Can flex between AP and AD with the augs\n\n\\- Yi's augs are very underrated, in my opinion some of the strongest augs in the game\n\n\\- Pumping up scaling allows you to play for winouts in situations where you should just lose\n\n[GAMES PLAYED](https://preview.redd.it/cnp69xf848db1.png?width=1146&format=png&auto=webp&s=56f997c69e5b975a77457aa23999746474250095)\n\n\\---\n\n**AUGMENT CHOICES AND GAMEPLAN!!!**\n\nThe strategy with Yi is to first look at what units and items you got during stage 1.\n\n**FOR AD START**: Take Pumping Up, see below for situations, don't take Gotta Go Fast.\n\n**FOR AP START**: Take Gotta Go Fast, don't take Pumping Up.\n\nBattle Ready sucks , usually reroll but see below for situations.\n\n\\---\n\nStage 2: **Pumping Up** (ONLY TAKE IF AD)\n\n* Silver: VERY BAD!! DO NOT TAKE!! ALWAYS REROLL!!!!\n* Gold: Decent,  \n* Prismatic: TOP 5 PRISMATIC COMBAT AUGS IN THE GAME JUST TAKE IT INSTANTLY\n\n\\---\n\nStage 3: **Battle Ready**\n\n* Silver: VERY BAD!! DO NOT TAKE!! ALWAYS REROLL!!!!\n* Gold: Bad, only take if your other 2 rolls are actually untakeable\n* Prismatic: Very bad, only take if your other 2 rolls are actually untakeable\n\n\\---\n\nStage 4: **Gotta Go Fast** (ONLY TAKE IF AP)\n\n* Silver: Decent, can reroll if you want but pretty takable\n* Gold: Good, usually just take unless you get something much better\n* Prismatic: Good, usually just take unless you are playing for some highroll option\n\n\\---\n\nThe gameplan is to **play around AD if your first augment is gold or prismatic.**\n\nIf it isn't you can try to play AP if you got an AP start and try to win off getting Gotta Go Fast.\n\nOr you can just try to play AD without Pumping Up and get another silver combat aug.\n\n\\---\n\n**AD ITEMS**\n\nPRIORITY:\n\n* **GUINSOO!!!!!!! GUINSOO!!!! GUINSOOO!!!!!** CANNOT PLAY APHELIOS WITHOUT IT!\n* DEATHBLADE!!! CANNOT PLAY APHELIOS WITHOUT AD\n\nGood items:\n\n* Titans (Deathblade alternative since it stacks fast with Pumping Up)\n* Last Whisper\n* Giant Slayer\n* Guardbreaker\n\nAnd then make whatever else, just remember you always prioritize damage items, can't do damage if you have no damage.\n\n\\---\n\n**AP ITEMS**\n\nPRIORITY:\n\n* SHOJIN \n\nGood Items:\n\n* Jewled Gauntlet\n* Giant Slayer\n* Guardbreaker\n* Gunblade\n* Blue Buff\n\nRabadons I usually don't make as that can be 2 items, its hard to make more damage items once you use the 2 rods, but make if you won't have any more components for a while.\n\nSame with Blue Buff, but it's still pretty good to make since you don't use the extra tears for damage items, just frontline / utility so you'll still probably 3 item your carry.\n\n\\---\n\n**BOARDS**\n\nJust going to give standard boards for options, can't really list all the alternatives for all these comps in a general playstyle guide.\n\n\\---  \n**LEVEL 7 APHELIOS**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lo7yj0m2a8db1.png?width=1007&format=png&auto=webp&s=6032eb8ca980f8109d8e93df7193e4d8e70dd6bd\n\nYou really need to 2 star Aphelios before going 8, sometimes you can get away with carrying Akshan 2 instead of being stuck on 7 rolling for Aphelios 2, but if the lobby is too strong you just gotta keep rolling.\n\n3 Deadeye obviously akward, but Urgot base value is too insane and is half your frontline.\n\nSoraka is a flex spot, can play Taric 2 or any other unit you manage to hit, invoker not too important.\n\n\\---\n\n**LEVEL 7 ZERI**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z2chswuea8db1.png?width=1012&format=png&auto=webp&s=6ca86c39710f9bb3a6df2bac466c5bdd89176112\n\nStandard Freljord board similar to Aphelios, definitely not the only version you can play but one of the stronger versions. \n\nZeri 1 is a lot more stable than Aphelios 1, can go 8 with Zeri 1 if your frontline is upgraded.\n\nJayce can be any gunner, but Senna > Jayce > Jinx > Trist.\n\nDon't have to play Urgot if you don't 2 star, can just play Jinx instead of Jayce and any unit you hit instead of urgot.\n\n\\---\n\n**LEVEL 7 SORCS**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/albxpsjna8db1.png?width=1008&format=png&auto=webp&s=65895a3799bc63a8f410f85e1c38eb4871f43771\n\n6 Sorc is a cheap spike and transitions nicely, but you have to win the fight fast before your weak frontline disappears. \n\nIf you hit J4 2, you can take out 2 sorc and Teemo for J4 + Sona + Shen.\n\nYou can duocarry Lux Velkoz, but with Yi augs you won't have so many items.\n\nLux 2 > Velkoz 2 > Lux 1, better to have items on Velkoz 2 as Lux 1 will always do damage regardless of her items and can also get radiant item from Demacia.\n\nOnce you hit the Lux 2 though you can just sell Velkoz, she can carry the fights stage 4 until you go 8.\n\n\\---\n\n**LEVEL 8 APHELIOS**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hrd9w809b8db1.png?width=1016&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2df9440b9244058640c6e4c707753b36ac94d0f\n\nSion 1 > Vi 2 if you highroll it. (happens pretty often)\n\nShen and Taric are flex spots, can play any 2 combo of units that are valuable.\n\n\\---\n\n**LEVEL 8 ZERI**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hi40hlpeb8db1.png?width=1017&format=png&auto=webp&s=40c3a901d491a1867c74b6c5fcd7a7d17e42f605\n\nAgain Sion 1 > Vi 2, also Senna > Jayce.\n\nRyze is a flex spot, can be anything else but usually Ryze is your best option.\n\n\\---\n\n**LEVEL 8 SORCS**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uzmggomnb8db1.png?width=1004&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c1d221d9d65519364cd62fa31df9fc102677e7e\n\nDropping the cheap Sorc units for more high value frontline, solves your problems from level 7 and you can usually just top4 from here.\n\nSoraka is a flex spot, usually just want to keep Soraka for the synergies though, but Ryze is for sure better.\n\n\\---\n\n**LEVEL 9 CAPPED APHELIOS**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8h5l51h8c8db1.png?width=1021&format=png&auto=webp&s=c127b69ebac9a880e10f228f552f210aabcc3c2a\n\nYeah just add the legendaries. Can just drop the syngergies now, legendary value is more worth.\n\nYou don't usually play Heimer until you've upgraded everything else as he is so expensive with his upgrades, but since it's the capped board I put him there.\n\n\\---\n\n**LEVEL 9 CAPPED ZERI**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c5sj5pwdc8db1.png?width=1025&format=png&auto=webp&s=cbd54ad1e118394cec83db0dcc320a08d2c427a8\n\nSame with Aphelios board, just add the legendaries.\n\nAgain, don't spend money on Heimer upgrades, roll without him on the board so he doesn't take shops, save him for last.\n\n\\---\n\n**LEVEL 9 CAPPED SORCS**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5jpksauxc8db1.png?width=1012&format=png&auto=webp&s=0d1d486c6479535c930097955c8732d3d37b1d74\n\nDrop the sorcs, all pretty low value late game.\n\nWin con is to just itemize Ahri and play for the nuke, stall for her third cast with big frontline.\n\n\\---\n\n**END**\n\n[**https://www.twitch.tv/christophotft**](https://www.twitch.tv/christophotft)\n\nPLEASE FOLLOW ME ON TWITCH!!

                "I don't care about this either, as long as its a closed system. Single purpose, so the face can't be used for anything else.",
                "To be upfront, I worked for a rather large facial recognition software company for a few years. I know the industry fairly well, as well as what exists, what works, and what doesn't, and here are some learnings...\n\nThe biggest consumers for facial recognition right now are airports, and this seems to be a largely acceptable use. The second biggest are casinos, specifically in the US (although also in the UK and other countries where it's permitted, including European) where it is used to stop self-described addicts as well as \"winners\" - this is less acceptable because most people seem to think being banned from a private casino is unacceptable (not that facial recognition has really changed anything in this area, since the casino staff have pictures of all the card counters liable to be there and are trained to identify them). South Wales Police were a key consumer of our product, as they were testing it a while back.\n\nFacial recognition in itself poses no threat to society, as long as it is exercised with care. The stuff I worked on was **not** AI trained, it was quite specifically an algorithm which looked at a variety of facial features, measured distances, analysed features, and identified people exclusively based on static measurements (e.g distance between pupils, nostrils, width/height/shape of mouth, etc.\n\nThe software I worked on specifically, which was definitely of the most popular kind at the time, was built to allow someone to upload a picture, to find faces within that picture, and then to find where that face had been in a CCTV network. It also had the capacity to select faces from a video feed and track them in realtime. The primary use of this technology, and honestly the only use, was in forensics to find out where someone had been, and was likely to be. Consider a terrorist incident in an airport - you have captured a picture of the person responsible, you pick them out, and you can see their route so far through the CCTV network. Of course in casinos they were typically used by the doors to detect problem gamblers, and mostly card counters and alert staff to their presence.\n\nAll that being said, I will always maintain that those who have nothing to hide have nothing to fear. Allowing something like this into anyones hands could open the doors to companies like Tesco using it to track consumer behaviour and exercise new marketing strategies, but they already do that in other ways and we have no protections in place - legislation now, or later, will make little difference. I'd rather see it develop and shut it down than prevent it entirely as the technology could be superbly beneficial in crime prevention.\n\n>\u201cThe UK should seek to emulate the European artificial intelligence act, which would place a ban on the use of facial recognition for surveillance purposes in all public spaces,\u201d added Johnson.\r\n\nThis is the real bizarre statement, though. Facial recognition is **not** illegal in the EU, AI based facial recognition software is. In fact, I believe it is not illegal at the minute to source AI derived facial recognition software from outside of the EU and use it within, so long as it is trained outside of the EU (although I stand to be corrected here, it's been a while since I've read the drafts of legislation).\n\nIn terms of hosting talks with people in the industry, I see that as a very good thing. Government needs to understand what the software is, and what it's capable of. They have met countless times with Big Brother Watch over the last decade, who are fierce proponents against facial recognition, so it only makes sense to meet with those who advocate for it. Doing otherwise would be hypocritical and willfully negligent.\n\nI kinda have to say, though, that given the direction the world is going (online retail, groceries, etc), I don't really see what part facial recognition will play. I'm yet to hear a single legitimate argument against facial recognition that doesn't involve the phrase \"it violates my civil liberties\". Those words are hollow and meaningless. What precisely are people worried is going to happen if facial recognition is rolled out more widely in stores and on streets?\n\nAlso note that I run facial recognition at home, knowing enough about it to build my own system. I only really use it for identifying that a face exists within an image, to alert me that someone is breaking into my garage or car, but it's there. It will never capture footage of anyone who isn't on my own private property. I don't see why shops shouldn't be allowed to do the same (or indeed why I shouldn't)."

It'll be a short post:\n\n**Best tech trees**: Beastmen (could use more ''challenges''), Chaos Dwarfs (very nice), Dark Elves, High Elves, Khorne, Skaven, WoC (some LLs need help and could use special tech tree/unique branch)\n\n**Average**: Cathay, Empire (hoping for Nuln dlc rework!), Greenskins, Ogres, Norsca, Tomb Kings, Wood Elves (too small tech tree), Vampire Coast, Vampire Counts, Bretonnia (maybe should be in bad)\n\n**Bad**: DANIEL (no tech tree), Dwarfs (few impactful, too bloated) , Kislev (famously bad), Nurgle (famously bad), Slaanesh, Tzeentch (forsaken replenishment wow), Lizardmen.\n\nThis post is meant to be short, but for example I posted Slaanesh in ''Bad'' category because I recently played N'kari and their tech tree isn't good. Roughly 40 turns before you'll get very important +6% replenishment, one branch is all about adding spells for Keepers of Secrets, diplomacy technologies could also bigger give vassal income (pretty important) and bonus to trade (would be useful).\n\nI play some races more often than the others, so please correct me where I'm obviously wrong.\n\nLet me know if you agree and I look forward to reading your takes on tech trees!\n\nedit-bold",

                "Man I am truly becoming the resident Tzeentch campaign apologist but I actually love their tech tree. It includes a few immediately impactful options that alter the way you play- you can rush Arcane Mirth on horrors for battle power, get the Forsaken and generic replenishment for a combat oriented army, or skip combat altogether in favor of unlocking more Changing of the Ways. There are standout rewards for long term research- the lord recruit ranks add up in a chaff faction like early Tzeentch. Finally, the Tzeentch tech tree is key to unlocking spells and multiple casts of spells on Lords of Change, transforming that unit from a decent flying monster to an unstoppable killing machine, and the best doomstack I've fielded so far.",
                "I think the Skink and Saurus techs are pretty good in the LM tree, but everything else is kind of crap. It takes like 75 turns to get the entire \"increase recruit rank\" line which is like...why? I'll win the campaign before that.",
                "I would put Dwarfs in excellent actually. Mostly because of how crazy good their units get after research/redline skills and XP. \n\nYou do need to focus on research, but there are good ways to donit as the Dwarfs.",
                "The high Elves have a meh tech tree, the effects might be good sure, but needing to build something for your tech tree and potentially going turns without research if you forget is a big pain and definitely worth docking points. Harder to make useful, therefore worse.",
                "Tomb Kings are one of the three: Bad, Quirky, or N/A. It's too heavily tied to the faction. Units like Ushabti are split from their lord, forcing a 4->6th dynasty rush to counterbalance. \n\nThe banners are not exactly world beaters, and serve only as a speedbump to slow you down in acquiring another army capacity. Honestly most of the tech tree is like this, it's an illusion of things you want vs what you need in the real, tangible power of armies and heroes.\n\nIt also aged poorly and the first army needs to come out or slightly before turn 10, game is way too fast and TK are unnecessarily punished for this design.",
                "In aggregate the lizardman techs can actually have some fairly good bonuses, its just that it takes ages to get them all.\nKind of similar to the dwarf tech tree, actually.\n\nA LOT of the warhammer III tech trees are just awful though. Not only for their incredibly small effects, but also because so many of them are clearly made purely with RoC in mind, not IE.",
                "I'd up the dwarf one to average, I'd say it's on par with Skaven and Lizardmen for how long can it be, and has some good tech. Some. Not amazing, but definitely better than the other ones you listed. Also, an advantage that dwarf have over every other race is that they can spam a larga amount of ancillaries giving extra research rate; I think that only Archaon can get even better results. I'd say that if Skaven is best (and it may be) then dwarf and lizardmen should be average.\n\nTo be honest, I'd place the Empire one in the bad category, I actually consider it worse than Kislev.\n\nBretonnia could be in the bad ones but I think that the free confederations are worth the average spot",

                "I think a key element is how useful the techs you get early on are - the endgame techs are cool, but pale in comparison to the ones that actually affect almost your entire campaign.\n\nIn that sense, Dark Elves getting 25 growth in the first 10 turns and great buffs for Darkshards/Shades soon after is, imo, the main reason their tech tree is top or nearly-top tier.  Because honestly, over half of their other techs are either very situational or very weak.\n\nTzeentch can pick up a variety of extremely strong techs in the first 10-20 turns, so even though they also have a bunch of ??? techs, they are actually near the top of my list.  Specifically, you can grab all the important stuff (horror arcane conduit, settlement income, replenishment, bolt of change) from the middle-left tree in the first 20-30 turns, and crazy campaign-breaking mechanics like Halt Faction in less.\n\nWhat's also nice with Tzeentch is that it feels like you're actually completing a tech tree as you get to the later parts, and you eventually get to play around with busted Lords of Change.",

                "I consider TK one of the most powerful tech trees, a single tech multiplies your military force. The entire power of the TK military is based on how many Wisdom Dynasty techs you have. \n\nVampirates is in some \"good\" or \"above average tier.\" One tech halving all your construction costs is incredibly impactful. Another tech giving -10% upkeep on the 8 most powerful faction units and reducing their recruitment to just 1 turn is a better effect than some LLs. Either is available by turn 11.\n\nI'm surprised you find HE & DE tech trees among the best in the game.

This last 5 years and moving forward - that's Christopher Mellon doing exactly what he does: whispering the right thing in right ears, moving the pieces around the board - he's the Machiavelli behind everything.\n\nThe guy doesn't to centre stage, he's rich, he's connected and he uses his connections with the skill and precision of a chess grand master.\n\nThis isn't a love letter btw, this is just paying attention: *everything* revolves around an empty shape, a blank spot only that man fits.",
                "Mellon has been orchestrating this from behind the scenes for a decade now. He\u2019s probably already spoken to Congress.",
                "So much progress and we are still on the \"Trust me, bro\"-level. Ok, the bros we have to trust this time are by far more credible than the bros before but still...we want to SEE the things all the bros saw.",

I always assumed he had more than second hand knowledge \ud83e\udee4\n\nAnybody know if maybe he misspoke in this interview? I want to hear from folk who were in the same room with the stuff, who touched it.",
                "It\u2019s not baffling. Mellon wouldn\u2019t name these people anyway, most of whom are likely the same ones who went to the Senate. That\u2019s why he wants Congress to look over the ICIG reports that Rubio and Schumer did.",
                "I don't understand why interviewers phrase it like its an American only thing or the American government hiding it from its citizens.  If NHI are real, that's a worldwide thing.",
                "Is it possible that someone inside the Defense Department told Mellon this as a way to convince him that a particular craft wasn\u2019t built in a top-secret skunkworks?  Is pretending to reveal a UFO conspiracy to close proximity outsiders a distraction to help keep the reality of what they\u2019ve actually built secret?  Or would that just backfire by bringing more attention?",
                "So in a 2016 interview, Chris Mellon said the following:\n\n> I highly doubt DoD or any other government agency is concealing UFO information. I participated in a comprehensive review of DoD's black programs and spent over a decade conducting oversight of the national foreign intelligence program, an almost totally separate world of secrets. I visited Area 51 and other military, intelligence and research facilities. During all those years, I never detected the faintest hint of government interest or involvement in UFOs. ... While a few new, previously overlooked documents might turn up (the bureaucracy is never perfect), I do not believe they would resolve the UFO issue or provide significant new insights. I can think of one lengthy UFO report that is classified only due to concerns over sources and methods. In fact, it identified a convincing conventional explanation for the pilot sightings in this particular case. There are lots of classified documents related to activities at Area 51, where high security is needed. But this is all legitimate stuff the American people would support. They have nothing to do with UFOs, to the best of my knowledge.\n\nLink: https://www.huffpost.com/entry/is-there-a-ufo-coverup-a_b_9865184\n\nThen in 2020 he was in some UFO documentary called The Phenomenon in which he claimed to have received videos of UFO\u2019s from some guy in a parking lot between 2004 and 2015. \n\nSo, at least one of those times he was lying.\n\nThat\u2019s probably related to why he isn\u2019t testifying.",
                "This isn't the smoking gun you guys think it is, Remember Flynn was a General and he's fucking batshit, Defense department officials can be too.",

Once he retires and no longer has first hand information, he changes his mind.  Perhaps hoping to profit from his credentials and boost his retirement savings.  Perhaps just gullible and convinced by hearsay. Either way, this guy isn't your savior.",

Technology tends to have an accelerationist factor, once you start developing advanced technologies it becomes easier to bridge to the next. So if they never hit on that spark, stagnation is to be expected.\n\nAnother factor is that the most advanced society is the Elves, and A) they have magic so they have less need to develop technologies to solve their problems, and B) they've largely been in decline in the Second and Third ages.",

                "Put it this way. When we consider technological advancement we really only think back to about 1500s and yes, we have made stunning advancements since then. \n\nFor most of human history we were unable to harness energy not pulled directly from an animal(horses) or wind (sails) or moving water (waterwheels). The first one is good, the other 2 require specific conditions for any real applicability. \n\nOnce we harnessed steam/gunpowder and later coal and oil is when things began to really take-off. \n\nPrior to the 1500s the bulk of technological advancements were cyclical. As in, people born later were not necessarily guaranteed to be living in a more technologically advanced environment than people before them.\n\nThink the egyptians and pyramids(2000 BCE) to rome and the aquaducts (0 CE) to the middle ages (800 CE) \n\nThere is a strong argument to be made that the egyptians and romans were significantly more technologically advanced than the cultures of the middle ages pre-ren. \n\nNow going further back you had periods where contemparary people would come upon ruins of cities that would have been impossible for the contemparies to build. \n\nSo the argument that \"its not a lot of advancement\" is accurate, but its also reflective of the vast majority of human history.

After your three wishes your soul is theirs to keep. They were also known to the Buddhist monks as the Brotherhood of Two dragons. The Red Dragons in the east and the Yellow in the west. Same goes for the native American Indians all the Aboriginals knew them as the Brotherhood of the Snake. The Egyptian knew them as Horus, Anubis and Amen Ra...That's why every religion says amen after every prayer cause they are paying homage to Satan Baphomet/ Draco Reptoids! Santa Claus is actually Satan's Claws both wearing red, both come from the fire, both have minions working feverishly. All religions and holidays are based on satanic doctrines and pagan dogmas. And if you don't believe me than you're being quite draconian about it.\n\nBasilisk in Latin means King of the Serpents, as in St Peters Basilica where there lies two Dragon Statues in the Vatican as well as Obelisks, the phallus of the Dragon that is why there is at least few obelisks in every city on the planet the Freemasons put them there throughout history in order to control consciousness...The Chinese, Japanese, India,  Indonesians, Mayans, Aztecs, Incas all worship the Dragon in antiquity... There are Gargoyles adorn every church and cathedral.... The Egregores the Watchers... The biggest trick the D-Evil can play is making humanity believe that he does not exist :/ \n\nHollow Earth True HISTORY , HITLER \u00a0& NWO ( GOTTA SEE THIS !!! ) Documentary\nhttps://youtu.be/lOXjxq3r69Q\n\nThere are over 10 thousand pyramids that align with each other on a global grid system with gps accuracy to the millimetre. In the Aegean Sea there are 13 ancient Megalithic sites that represent the 13 Illuminati Families that control the world, that when you connect them dot to dot, over 1000km area makes a perfect Maltese Cross. This is the symbol of the Monarchy, Freemasonry, Vatican, Jesuits, Knights of Malta and Templars, even Hitler's Germany. Megalithic architecture on geomantic energy sites, in conjunction with an occult esoteric satanic Freemasonry religion of Kabbhalism, aka the Lucifer experiment in order to control humanities consciousness and why there is an obelisk in every major city on the planet... The pyramids also create dimensional portals into Agartha/Hollow Earth, hence disappearance of boats, planes in the Bermuda Triangle and Dragon's Triangle...\n\nhttp://chani.invisionzone.com/uploads/monthly_08_2013/post-248-0-56239100-1376895880.jpg.\n\nDragons see humanity as a resource for the simple fact that they are not vegetarians! 1 million people disappear in the United States every single year. 8 million children globally disappear annually off the globe.\n\nThe Legend Of Atlantis\nhttps://youtu.be/pihxOs-pVRA\n\n\nSecrets Of The 3rd Reich Secret Nazi Research in Alien Technology\nhttps://youtu.be/B0uEvZsQAV8\n\nNephilim: TRUE STORY of Satan, Fallen Angels, Giants, Aliens, Hybrids, Elongated Skulls & Nephilim\nhttps://youtu.be/1zz8_MxcnzY\n\nIf none of the links are active go to my YouTube channel",

However, I don\u2019t think free energy has been mentioned by anyone credible. \n\nThe reason why this theory of free energy is popular is because everyone is asking the question \u201cWhy are the world governments hiding such technologies?\u201d The answer that usually comes up is power and money. And what\u2019s the power currently? Oil industries, petrodollar etc. A hit to those will impact a lot of rich and powerful individuals/entities in US too, especially the anti-disclosure group. That\u2019s why this theory is popular. It\u2019s simple, convincing and it attracts a lot of people. \n\nThere might be other reasons like religion but why will Soviets, Chinese and non-religious from US hide it?

                "Didn\u2019t Bob Lazar mention it in the context of UFOs and the US trying to reverse engineer it? Him, and now others have said it too.\n\nZero point energy is a real thing in physics. It comes from quantum mechanics, in particular quantum field theory. Zero point energy is just the lowest energy state of any quantum field. However since all quantum fields fluctuate (due to the uncertainty principle), even empty space or matter at (almost) absolute zero has these energy fluctuations. However we have no idea how to continually extract that energy or even if it\u2019s possible. There\u2019s been [a few experiments](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casimir_effect) that momentarily turn this energy into work, and prove it exists, but with our current understanding of physics we don\u2019t know if it could be made into anything like a power plant. Almost all physicists would say \u2018not possible\u2019.\n\nHaving said that, it\u2019s not easy to understand because you need to learn the basics of quantum mechanics and quantum fields, and also understand Heisenberg\u2019s Uncertainty Principle, which is quite a strange thing. The good news is that if you can understand that, you\u2019ll then understand Hawking radiation and, with a little more research, the very interesting area of quantum entanglement. The uncertainty principle also explains why there is a minimum size something can be (the planck length) and the minumum time something can take (the planck time). Quantum mechanics explains a lot of physics, it\u2019s worth trying to understand how it works.",

Now, we might be talking about pollutant-free energy, which would be worthwhile for sure, but still not free to the consumer for reasons stated above.  Look at wind and solar, both basically produce energy without fuel, so they\u2019re essentially sources of \u201cfree energy\u201d but neither are free to deliver.

Humanity is struggling to survive in the 41st Millenium and the future seems bleak. They lost many of their technologies and do not have the ability to reclaim them or develop new tech.\n\nBut what about the Asuryani Eldar? The inhabitants of the Craftworld's live in seemingly utopic societies, especially when compared with the life of your average citizen in the Imperium, and the Eldar are free to pursue whatever Path or choice in life they desire as their worldships have plenty of resources to spare. Their bright minds and great knowledge, with a heavy societal focus on psychic powers and magitech(like Wraithbone for example) seem like the perfect recipe for a species to be technologically advanced. And while the Craftworlders certainly do match that description, their technology is mostly stuff their ancestors took with them while fleeing upon their ships from the debauched Aeldari emprie, and dosent seem to have grown much. The Aeldari have the minds, and the resources to advance their technology even further and reclaim the knowledge they lost, yet they are still technologically the same as they were in the wake of the Fall.

                "The people who created the best technology were probably the \u2018exarchs\u2019 of their field, super good at their field because of how much commitment they put into it. The whole culture of the craft worlds and the paths is to try to avoid that as much as possible. Fewer super artisans, fewer super technology artifacts/weapons. \n\nAlso, Eldrad was alive at the time of Great Crusade, which wasn\u2019t long after the Fall, but he was born after the Fall. So in terms of Eldar lives, it actually hasn\u2019t been that long. Consider, maybe the Eldar are trying to regrow their technology, but it takes 20,000 years to grow that super specialized building which grows the super engines or whatever. We\u2019re halfway there! Pre-Fall Eldar would regularly prepare planets to become Maiden Worlds and not care that it would take tens of thousands of years for them to finish terraforming.",
                "Eldar are hamstrung by Slaanesh, everything they do is tied to their psych powers, want a better tank? That needs a bonesinger to will it into reality. Want longer distance travel? Gonna take some powerful psychic abilities to extend that far. Slaanesh handicapped the Eldar psychic potential and nerfed their ability to progress hard in the meantime.",
                "There are multiple factors. Most of which is caused by their entire schtick of being a dying species. Their decline in numbers forces a lot of old and young aeldari to pick up arms, and the younger generation is more interested in fighting than art, culinary, and most importantly science. They have bonesingers, and a few craftworlds have innovated new weapons here and there but not exactly at a fast enough pace to successfully discover or rediscover technology they had. Let alone to mass produce.\n\nAnother reason is what a lot will tell you is that craftworlds do not have the high technology of their old empire, its advance but to the eldar its the equivalent of dusting off old blueprints and making do with what works for now. They do have a craftworld that search for old croneworlds that posses two valuable resources: soul stones and functioning tech that they can bring back and try to re create it.\n\nAnother reason is that they are more concerned with hiding and staying out of sight and mind. The last being the most important since the imperium is never above killing them even when there is a more dangerous threat on the same map, tyranids and orks would literally dive for a kill. Chaos is obvious with slaanesh, tau exist and is led astray, votann exist... (literally nothing came up of betrayals yet). You get the point that they are being besieged on all sides, and they are few in numbers.\n\nFinally, its the level of psychic requirements we theorize that their actual top tier stuff runs on is too damning to use, not out of superstition but because slaanesh handicapped all eldar to limit their psyker abilities if they don't want to be drained on the spot.",
                "Simple answer : they do. It still manages to keep up with the stuff the imperium is rediscocering. They just don't get massive breakthrough anymore.\n\nLongest answer : they would probably need to change their onlook on the world to reach breakthroughs. As in, accept informations from \"lesser races\", which is not something we're likely ti see, especially since eldars are not really liked by authors. \n\nMeta answer : eldars don't get real updates, and probably won't get something as large as primaris anytime soon.",
                "Can't really answer this question without also addressing a few of its assumptions.\n\n**First, the Asuryani are culturally conservative, with limited room for failure.** The Asuryani are, as mentioned, the equivalent of doomsaying Puritans who fled Europe for North America... if Europe then promptly collapsed behind them into a literal burning pit of hell. They are culturally and spiritually *very inclined* to avoid pure automation, extreme luxuries, experimentation for its own sake, and anything that would distance them from the consequences and costs of their actions. On at least some level, the Asuryani *want* things to be hard, because it forces them to consider whether they ought to be doing them at all.\n\nThe Asuryani also live aboard craftworlds \u2013 gigantic self-contained generation ships, drifting voidborne arcologies. They live in a post-scarcity society, yes, but that's not because they produce infinite resources to do whatever they want \u2013 it's because they've learned to avert scarcity, operating within the delicate balance of their means. They don't have materials to burn on grand industrial projects or dubious experiments, and if something goes badly wrong, there's nowhere else for them to *go*.\n\n**Second, \"technological advancement\" is very hard, quite abstract, and the Asuryani aren't united.** As technology (and its associated field of knowledge) becomes more and more complex, it relies on and requires an ever-deepening and ever-broadening base of comprehension. Even in our era, much of our technology is so complex that it requires multiple dedicated specialists and facilities working in concert simply to understand, maintain, and reproduce *individual* components, never mind improving on the whole. We do not expect any one individual to fully comprehend every aspect of a fighter jet, a microwave, or an electric toothbrush, or any one factory to produce every part they require. The technology of the Aeldari Empire was incomparably advanced, and so it is unsurprising that huge swathes of their technological and industrial base were simply lost in the Fall.\n\nThe Asuryani are not simply sitting on the laurels of the Aeldari Empire \u2013 they are reconstructing, adapting, or reinventing technology which required multiple lifetimes of education that no longer exists, using components made in facilities that no longer exist. Tools made using tools made using tools made using tools that no-one alive understands.\n\nEven within those limited means, the Asuryani are thoroughly isolated. On our world, teams of scientists and engineers collaborate and compete constantly across the globe. If a team of artisans on one craftworld make a regional variation on the shuriken catapult or Banshee war-helm... where's that going to go? They're not going to email the design to all the other craftworlds. They can't pool their efforts and observations, and even when they meet another craftworld, they may find they've travelled down quite distinct philosophies of engineering since they last interacted.\n\n**Finally, the Asuryani have, in fact, technologically advanced.** At the time of the Fall, the Asuryani were a ramshackle collection of exile craft and refugee ships. They were the equivalent of prepper communes, outsider groups who saw the end coming for society and went to live in a bunker or makeshift rural compound. Everything in the millennia since is stuff that they've built and invented and adapted for themselves, in order to survive in a very different galaxy \u2013 one where they have no home worlds, the Imperium exists and wants them dead for being aliens, Slaanesh exists and thirsts for their souls, the Eye of Terror is open, the other Chaos Gods are far more ascendant, and so on.\n\nThat includes obvious innovations like Soulstones, the Infinity Circuit, and Aspect Warriors, as well as Wraith Constructs \u2013 which may be *based* on existing psychic-robot technology but certainly had to be heavily reworked to account for the new reality they live in \u2013 and who knows how many other forms of civilian technology that we never really see, because the game is called Warhammer.",
                "Eldar \"sing\" their tech into existence. They don't have engineers or even scientists as we understand them. They are a psychic race in all they do. The Craftworlds weren't so much built as they were grown.",

                "I think the real answer is because GW are bad at writing. There's no reason craftworlds don't invent new things, and I would imagine that they do. Rather, we know they do: soulstones, wraithknights, hemlocks, and void spinners are all post-fall tech. \n\nNew developments probably happen at a slow pace because of several reasons: \n\n1: the path system. You need someone on the correct path to invent the specific thing you'd want to see progress in.\n\n2: Eldar society: there is no central government to steer things.\n\n3: Lack of need. Eldar have mostly completed the tech tree anyway, why try to improve upon perfection? Even though craftworlds are often portrayed as at immediate risk of dying, most craftworlders still live an extremely comfortable life in a post-scarcity world. There is no pressure to develop solutions for some problems.\n\n4: you think of technology as a human. Eldar are very alien. More importantly; they are psychic. They don't think in technological solutions, they'll just realise whatever they need to through psychic means.",
                "Well that's the problem with the Eldar. They came out of the metaphorical womb at their zenith. They were perfectly created beings by the old ones, with their genetic legacy, intellect, and technological path pre determined. They have already reached the end point of their technological advancement, and also lost most of it. They are high tier, but their potential as a species is capped. This is another reason why they are stagnating and dying off.\n\n Unless they change something about their culture and way of life, that is.",

                "I've always viewed it as not a matter of not wanting to innovate as much as it is a case of not being able to. The Eldar were created by the Old Ones at their current technological level. They never truly invented much that didn't already exist for them already (an example would be the nightspinner, they took the technology for monofilaments weaponry and made it larger and on a turret). It's part of why I find it easy to hate them, their arrogance in regards to their \"superior\" technology is a complete joke when it was handed to them by God level beings. The Eldar never struggled as a race until they themselves invented the only original idea they had, Slaanesh.",
                "I think the thing that gets overlooked is how important economies of scale are to technological advancement. \n\nEven if took an entire engineering department back in time to WW1 you would be able to produce smart phones. Maybe you could create one smart phone\u2026maybe. The world economy just wasn\u2019t big enough to produce and supply the materials needed. \n\nThe Elder have technology from back when they ruled the entire galaxy. The fact that they can reliable reproduce most of it in economies consisting of a single craftworld either speaks to their sophistication or strains credulity.",
                "As far as they're concerned they have already reached the technological peak of existence, so why change? They looked down at all others as a result of their self conceived notions of superiority -- much like several other species within WH40K.\n\nThe only species that is actively advancing, and looking for improvement, are the Tau.\n\nAnd I guess Cawl counts, but more than one of his absorbed personalities would fight him on that subject; and at the end of the day he is still a member of the Martian Machine Cult.",
                "I don't know, and it doesn't really make sense. But I think a lot about the Eldar doesn't make sense.\n\nThey do progress their technology a little bit though, I thought I'd read somewhere that the Hemlock was invented to deal with the Tyranids, which makes it significantly post-fall.",
                "The Eldar have existed for 60 million years. They peaked technologically a long time ago.\n\nMy best guess is because they're an engineered species. They came out the oven fully cooked, so likely had all the technology they had at their peak at their inception.\n\nIt's also why they seemingly haven't evolved for 60 million years either. If you create a specific tool for a specific job, you don't want it to drift or evolve.\n\nSo my theory is that they don't evolve or innovate because they can't. They have internal limiters that stop them. And if anything, the catastrophe that was the birth of Slaanesh was caused by them finally overcoming their cultural limiters and evolving their society in an unintended direction.\n\nKinda like a computer program that's been running too long getting corrupted.",
                "They lack the industrial and population base for it, maybe?\n\nLike, the ancient Aeldari were extremely advanced. Extraordinarily advanced. They were the most powerful species in the galaxy and it wasn't particularly close, if I'm remembering the lore scraps we've gotten correctly. Like, consider all the shit we see the Necrons get up to tech-wise, and consider that when up against the Aeldari, the 'Crons decided the best answer was to just go to sleep for millions of years and hope they took care of themselves.\n\nImproving in that tech requires a ton of man/elf hours. And while craftworlds are populous, they're not *that* populous.\n\nMaybe.",
                "Simple answer: they don\u2019t need to. What they have has worked perfectly for 60 million years, and in a lot of ways is better than what some of the races have available in 41K.",
                "I think the Eldar empire was already technologically stagnant, after all you're not likely inventing stuff or passing on the knowledge of how your own tech works if you're committing crimes just to not be bored.  The Craftworlders would have to undo centuries of ignorance.",
                "here's a question are we primarily focusing on just the craftworld eldar cause we do have drukhari with haemonculi etc being fully capable of this, though granted most of there advancements is in tormenting and or prolong people or just killing   \n\n\nbut on a random note I think the closest to technological advancement in terms of craftworlds would be Yme-Loc and Il-Kaithe cause i know them both to have extremely skilled bonesinger craftsmen",
                "> The Aeldari have the minds, and the resources to advance their technology even further and reclaim the knowledge they lost, yet they are still technologically the same as they were in the wake of the Fall. Why is that?\n\nFor craftworlders, most of their prior technology is relying on the warp and warp smithing which became problematic with the Fall. \n\nHowever, that's not to say technology isn't being developed, it's just usually the innovations that happen come from the dark eldar that we see coming in.",
                "I too wonder about this.\n\nDue to Slaanesh being a whore , Eldars can't really use psychic powers much nowadays.\n\nSo it is kind surprising that Eldars have not moved towards non psychic tech. \n\nNecessity is mother of all invention. It off really irrelevant that their main stuff used to be soul powers. One has to change with times to adapt to new reality.\n\nSo given that Eldars are so few and they can't really use psychic power fully, they have a very big incentive to develop non psychic weaponry to survive. 10+k years is massive time to make technological advancements.",
                "I think the biggest reason is doylist rather than watsonian: I think it's just that asuryani culture is still really not fleshed out all that much. We have such a pitifully small number of paths that have appeared 'on screen' or even been mentioned. We really don't know a lot about how craftworlds operate.\n\nThere probably is some \"Path of the Scientist,\" because discovery and innovation are necessary for any society, but we've never seen it.\n\nThere's also the big issue that anything that doesn't appear on the tabletop gets less coverage, and doubly so for any non-Imperial faction.",
                "Short version: Because GW can't be bothered.\n\nYada yada ancient race, yada yada pride, bulcrap. \n\nNecessity is the mother of invention, and both Craftworld and Dark Eldar have necessity to spare. CWE are heavily outnumbered, need to protect their souls and. In addition to that, as you noted, they use a ton of psychoplastics and have a somewhat artisanal approach to creating anything. This should make adapting designs and developing them further relatively easy. On top of THAT, they could just try to recover some of their old weapons from the crone worlds - they kinda left the empire in a hurry.\n\nDark Eldar came from a faction that relied on psychic potential for nigh everything and, well, they let their psychic potential atrophy, so they need to adapt a lot of stuff. Plus, see also  the \"endless torment\" before. \n\nHowever, CWE and DE have had very few new models since their big 4E/5E updates and GW is so far behind in updating the craftworlds models - they have a lot of 2E/3E sculpts - that it has few resources. Also, some writers really buy into the \"doomed ancient rate\" stuff."

But that only exists in a handful of places.\n\nEGS is a next-generation approach that engineers rock permeability into higher quality formations. It uses similar drilling and fracturing techniques as fracking for oil and gas drilling, as well as software simulations, mapping tools, and so on.\n\nThe USGS estimates the United States has between 100 GW and 500 GW of EGS potential. It cannot be used across the entire country, and certain regions are much better than others, but the utilization rates (capacity factor) for EGS could be relatively high. Existing geothermal is near 80%, for example.\n\nThat means developing roughly 120 GW of EGS could supply about 20% of the total electricity consumption of the United States.\n\nImportant to note that geothermal does have carbon emissions due to chemical reactions in the rock, although they're only about 1/10th of natural gas power plants.",

I just thought that was interesting because it made me wonder if the earths ground is actually the lowest level of ground or if there's a planet out there with absolutely zero electrical floor kind of like the background noise that you can hear in a p.a system is called the noise floor so I wonder if there's an electrical noise floor that's even lower than what grounding to earth can provide.",

                "A mix of medieval transitioning into renaissance era tech and a couple of steam engines.\n\nThe reason for the steam engines, which is pretty advanced for a world with pretty basic tech, is that the ancient Elf civilization of Morthania used to be pretty advanced tech wise, I would say super early Industrial Revolution type tech. When Morthania fell, their tech fell with them, pretty much resetting everyone technology wise.\n\nModern historians have been piecing together Morthania's lost past and have begun implementing their old tech. Authorania, which is the descendent nation of Morthania, has primarily focused on mathematics, physics and medicine. The Palorians, which are a Human nation, figured out how to make steam engines in limited capacity. They are only seen on tug boats pulling sail ships into port.\n\nOn a side note, Morthanians were not the first to use steam engines. Legend says the oldest steam engine in the world was invented by a race of Giants, which serves as life support for the last and only living giant. The Giant race went extinct right around the time the Elves first started appearing, which makes the steam engine over 100,000 years old. It's probably lasted so long because it is located in a cave and doesn't run continuously.",

Their technology is over septillion years old as they are ruled by the now sealed God of Destruction. They aren't active yet and basically every single thing in the empire went invisible and into another dimension on sleep mode, waiting for the day thier ruler returns. \n\nTheir technology includes Apex AI's which are literally harnessing the power of gods. The first Apex Ai, Argor the Apex of War was initially built to be a War/Transport machine due to the Draconex Species' home solar system was about to get eaten by a giant space monster and the Argor was their last hope. Giant Space Monster tossed the Argor into a star when they finally fought which just happened to be the corpse of a dead god and they fused. Basically enhancing Argor's code into a hybrid between the energy of a god itself and well regular code. Essentially creating a Machine God. This allowed the Argor to beat the monster but had to quickly rescue everyone as well since no star. Its abilities include a lot of things but at full power it was capable of annihilating entire universes all on its own with its pure weaponry. It also has the power of Soul Manipulation which it got after beating and absorbing another God who had said power. \n\nThe second Ai is Omegatron, Apex of Science. This was built from the original now dubbed 'God Code' of the Argor. The Central Core was a Mega Pyramid before the Great Erasure happened. It has the ability to calculate upwards of 100 Million different situations in virtual universes and then choose the most reliable outcome giving it future sight to an extent. It could also use said Virtual Universes to create things registered in the Draconex Database and then bring them forth to reality. It is not as physically powerful as the Argor but it's more utility focused.\n\nThese 2 are usually both the 2nd in commands of the Draconex Empire behind the God of Destruction. Since the God of Destruction is well not really a good leader these 2 are basically handling things for the most part. But if their leader says a command they must absolutely follow it. \n\nRight now the 2 Apex AIs are in % Mode. These are basically 0.000001% of their power being online as drones.

We should see a bunch of stars cloudy from their Dyson swarms and we should see stars going cloudy steadily as the expanding ring of starships conquer more systems.\n\nReally we probably shouldn't even exist.\n\nSo the Fermi paradox says either we are damn early or somehow the singularity theory is wrong due to something we don't know.  \n\nUFOs would be the same.  So far bullshit but every time someone credible says they have evidence it makes you seriously wonder what it would mean if it were true.

These were the first Humans who upon gaining knowledge from the divine soon discovered fire, agriculture and how to make tools the Deities seperated the land into two continents, One taking domain of The North and the other of the South. There the Gods would help the Humans develop their own seperate cultures. Before the Deities descended upon the Prithva many large gargantuan beasts called Kshretas, these Kshretas were anywhere from 80-250 metres tall and roamed the planet destroying much life upon their path seeing their destructive and invasive nature the Gods drove them to exile in an mythical island within the Eternal Cyclone.",

The aspect that most folks don't realize is that when companies offshore it's simply because there are not enough hours in the day to accomplish complicated tasks. Everyone has limited resources.\n\nLet me give an example. My COO popped in Slack and put in a request for a report. Very complicated, lots of data, the usual. Typically I'd take that request write up specs and engage a contractor who'd work on it for a couple of weeks. They'd deliver it to me, I'd deploy it to test, verify it, usually shoot it back for changes and then eventually we'd have a deliverable.\n\nWhat do I do today? Instead of the back-and-forth with my contractor(s) I'll ask ChatGPT to generate the T-SQL queries I need. Then I spend a couple of hours laying out the report and I'm done. WAY less of my time spent overall and zero time spent with the contractor.\n\nToday we're saving tens of thousands a month on reduced contractor hours and I'm the only person using it right now. Once we train the rest of the staff in how to use it safely I suspect we'll be looking at a 10x improvement in productivity and at least 90% of our contract work will stop.

If not introducing all new Akaviri ones would be a contrast probably too sharp in relation to the other series.

It\u2019s exceptionally difficult to preserve ships. It\u2019s a huge financial burden, and far too many historical vessels get scrapped or are left to rot because of this. I know of someone who went bankrupt and lives out of their car because they tried desperately to save a historic ship from the scrap.It\u2019s sister ship, the Olympic didn\u2019t survive the Great Depression and was scrapped.

Her internal support structures were compromised and slamming into the bottom absolutely shattered her.  \n\nThe fact she's dug so far into the mud is probably one of the biggest factors holding her bow together at this point.  The mud is acting like a buttress and keeping her from completely splaying apart.",

It was the case for some of them, as only 5 people remain missing. If you don't know this boat's demise, it was horrible. Most of the people who perished were high school students. The authorities did next to nothing to save them.\n\nThe titanic today would probably not have to deal with victim families (even though, it remains a grave site in a way, similar to the SS Edmund Fitzgerald in Lake Superior), but I think the integrity of the boat as well as our capacity to preserve the ship once taken out of the water is severely lacking. I understand some people would like to see the wreck (as misguided as this could be) but I don't think taking it out is a good idea either.",

People were already talking about it soon after the sinking, and movies were made about raising the Titanic.  Now, I think WWI would have disrupted any attempts, but I think, had the technology been available to raise her, then society being what it was at the time\u2026 It would have been raised, or rather, that the attempt would have been made (to varying degrees of success or failure).  Titanic was such a part of the zeitgeist and society was different then, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really comparable to situations like the Costa Concordia.",

It broke its back in multiple places just hitting at that speed, that it wouldn't surprise me if she came apart during any attempt of an ascent.\n\nThe stern section is just an automatic no on all fronts simply because of the fact that it tore itself apart just falling to the bottom. The impact essentially turned her into a massive pile of debris that only loosely resembles the stern.\n\nIf we had the technology in 1912 to salvage her at that depth, we'd be bringing her up in pieces, and by then there'd be nothing left to salvage.",
                "Put it to you this way.\n\n\nIf it happened more recently, the sinking wouldn't have had the kind of historical sentimental value we place on the Titanic.\n\nWe would have made a news story out of it, printed it, scrapped it and then moved on with our lives.",

I don't remember the details but I think they tried to bring up a crashed/failed Russian sub, which was a lot smaller and less brittle. IIRC the US Navy wanted to steal it to see what the Russians were up to, lol.  I'm not sure which sub it was. Could even be mixing up the Thresher or Scorpion subs. I believe Robert Ballard was covertly searching for one of those and found Titanic as a fully funded side quest.  Idk, someone who knows will show up.",
                "There\u2019s a (fiction) book that you might enjoy. Raise the Titanic by Clive Cussler. The plot is exactly what the title says. Written before they actually located the wreck, so it\u2019s purely theoretical, but has a surprising amount of scientific ideology.",
                "Honestly, leave her down in the ocean, because it is a grave sight, and should be respected.",
                "It\u2019s not too late to bring her up, and we do have the technology. That\u2019s the whole point, that not many people are aware of. It\u2019s just the fact that nobody wants to fund it, and that it would cost billions.",
                "No.  If it was in a diveable depth for normal SCUBA then they'd raise it and get it out of there just because of the environmental impact.  But any deeper than that no.  I mean look at Britannic.  The best trained divers with the best equipment can get down there as its right at the limit of that, but there is no way it'll ever be raised even being in decent shape.  \n\nI don't think we currently have the tech to raise a freshly sunk Titanic and if we did th cost would be astronomical and its so deep that even with the environmental knowledge we have now they'd just say its deep enough and far enough out its not going to effect anything.  And Titanic was carrying coal, not fuel oil so its not going to come to the surface and make a massive slick.",

As noted here, even Costa Concordia had to be scrapped in the end. Certainly some battleships, like at Pearl Harbor, were refloated and put back into service, but Pearl Harbor is not the bottom of the Atlantic, and a battleship is not a high-end cruise liner.",

                "Absolutely not. Even disregarding the fact that retrieving a whole shipwreck at that depth is absolutely impossible, the wreck is split into two and has very little structural integrity left from the sinking and impact with the ocean floor to survive being lifted to the surface, never mind the fact that the stern's condition can be accurately summed up as 'a pile of ruined metal that vaguely resembles half of a ship'.",
                "Just look at Project Azorian and the raising of k-129. She was roughly 3,500 feet deeper then the Titanic and the CIA spent billions and still wasn\u2019t able to successfully get the whole thing up. \n\nIt\u2019s one hell of a story though. There are some good books about it and lots of really interesting reading online. They recovered bodies and filmed their burial at sea which was eventually shown to the Soviets. Also they allegedly recovered a nuclear torpedo which is the only instance of one nation getting its hands on another\u2019s nuclear weapons AFAIK.",
                "It was too late as soon as she left the surface. The bow broke it's back when it hit the bottom. It would have broken up even then if you had the technology and tried. There's no point in raising something that has already broken up. It'd never be structurally safe.",

We're not going  to backwards engineer this kind of weaponry without some help.The limits of our current technology lies within our ability to process certain materials and integrate them into our current understanding of electrical engineering. We need a breakthrough on how we power everyday items. We need batteries that aren't batteries but are variable in there output, or that have vast stores of energy.  Some kind of self charging or self creating source of energy.\n\nCoupled with some kind of quantum computer capable of having data existing in two or more different spaces at the same time. We could have energy and weapons systems indescribable to what is possible currently. We could have tech that is completely unheard of in our current existence. Things will be beyond our understanding if we can achieve this kind of advancement.\n\nAnd you think that aliens gave us nukes. Come on. \n\nWhile it is a pretty incredible breakthrough to harness the kind of Power a nuclear bomb has to a normal person unlike myself it seems almost too easy. The brak down of the little boy bomb is not super sophisticated. It's basic physics at the end of the day. And that advancement is the next kind of jump we need now to propel our current advancement to where we need to be for long distance space travel.\n\nIf aliens gave us anything it's how to use nuclear power. I believe that if it was used the right way we could use it as a energy system to move us into space. If they gave this tech to us. We used it completely wrong and for our own selfish gain.",

                "I doubt this because the first nuclear weapons were downright primitive compared to what we have now. They were huge, had extremely low efficiency in converting their fissile material to energy, etc. If we obtained nukes from aliens, it would seem incredibly odd that a civilization so advanced would be hauling around an ancient antique that we could reverse engineer. You can look on Wikipedia and see the history of the development of nuclear weapons; the first one consisted of two slugs of uranium, one being fired into the other with gunpowder to form a critical mass, of which only a small percentage of the painstakingly enriched uranium even experienced fission. I forget what percent of the uranium actually experiences fission, but it is something in the low single digits.\n\nImagine if someone with a smartphone visited somone in the 1920's, and later, these people figured out how to make a primitive telephone. I guarantee you there is no way someone from the 1920s handling a smartphone would be able to infer how to make a wired telephone from examining it.\n\nIt would be like that.",

            "selftext": "^(i posted this elsewhere while r/aliens was down, so you may have read it already)\n\nThis month (june 2023) we learned from a whistleblower ([the debrief](https://thedebrief.org/intelligence-officials-say-u-s-has-retrieved-non-human-craft/), [the guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/06/whistleblower-ufo-alien-tech-spacecraft)) that the US govt is running reverse engineering programs on craft of nonhuman origin. The vast majority of what goes on in these programs is still unknown.\n\nThis post will describe a hypothetical scenario of what such a program could be like and the technologies it could produce. Because these are \"ultimate technologies\" that exploit the fundamental nature of reality, we first have a look at what that reality is.\n\n# Multidimensional reality\n\nI do recommend you read part I and II, but if they are too long for your taste, you can skip them because \"part III: The program\" (which is further down this post) will have a little recap at the start.\n\n* [Part I: Multidimensional reality and the different intelligences in it](https://i.imgur.com/91hgaET.png) (infographic)\n* [Part II: The physical consensus](https://i.imgur.com/qJxPsDL.png) (infographic)\n* Part III: The program (continue reading to see this infographic)\n\n# The arms race\n\nIf we really exist in a thought-responsive, multidimensional reality, then at some point some government or group will try to exploit it to their advantage. Especially because they know someone else might beat them to it. Maybe this technology- and arms race has already started, or it will somewhere in the future. This is what Coulthart says about it:\n\n[Coulthart interview](https://youtu.be/R_ci--0RE7g?t=691) (timestamp 11:31)\n> Coulthart: I think any craft is the crown jewels, it's worth lying about it. If I was the U.S president and I knew that my country had a craft that represents technology thousands of years in the future, and that we're pouring resources and trying to master that technology, I would lie about it. I would conceal it as long as I could. It's like the Manhattan Project of the 21st century, because you know if you can crack that technology, you are light years ahead of your Rivals. And the Russians and the Chinese know that. So there is this battle going on in private between nation states fighting over who develops this technology first.\n\n# The consciousness connection with the program\n\nNow before we get to the actual program, heres another interesting quote from Coulthart (same interview as previous quote)\n\n[Coulthart interview](https://youtu.be/R_ci--0RE7g?t=388) (timestamp 6:28)\n> Coulthart: I've spoken to well over 20 people now. What I was told consistently was the technology is mind-blowing [...] One of the people I spoke to told me that it had a lot to do with a mind interface connection with the engineering. That it was driven by some kind of consciousness or some kind of um uh intelligent connection with machinery that was beyond our understanding. Having heard it from Nat and and having heard it from multiple other sources, I am absolutely certain that the United States government has recovered non-human technology. Absolutely certain.\n\nTheres also this quote from Garry Nolan, who for perhaps a decade has spoken with insiders of the program (and who was almost accepted into the program himself):\n\n[Garry Nolan interview](https://youtu.be/pSZUBulON6I?t=2684) (timestamp 44:44)\n> Coulthart: You've told me that you believe, on evidence, that there is a non-human intelligence of advanced technology on this planet.\n\n> Garry Nolan: Right... advanced capabilities, now i don't know whether it's a technology per se because i'm leaving open the idea that it's some form of consciousness that is non-material. And i know, i say to my colleagues out there, i know this all sounds absolutely crazy. But if you've seen the things that i've seen you would only be able to come to a similar conclusion.\n\n# \"The program\"\n\nThis is actually the main part of this post:\n\n* [Part III: The program](https://i.imgur.com/ntwNlOu.jpg) (infographic)\n\nBefore reading on, please fully read the infographic or you wont understand the rest of this post. The infographic contains information about:\n\n* A TLDR of part I and II\n* What \"the program\" is\n* Experimental phase of the program\n* How the retrieved materials could be reverse engineered\n* Description of a fully working craft\n* How the craft-consciousness interface connection could work\n* Something to do with time\n\nFinished reading part III? According to the whistleblower and other sources, the reverse engineering has not been very successful yet (although some sightings suggest it is). So you may think this craft described in the infographic is not plausible. But keep in mind that it doesnt really matter when this program succeeds, because it eventually results in time travel. From that moment on, these craft could appear anywhere in our timeline. So some portion of the UAPs that we currently see could be such craft.\n\nAlso, in a video last year, [Coulthart made this statement](https://youtu.be/cfixnKYCbfg?t=60) (timestamp 60 seconds):\n\n> Coulthart: I wish i could tell you what i'm being told right now, but i don't think it's responsible for me to talk about it until i've been able to verify it more, because i don't want to panic people or be irresponsible.\n\n> Coulthart: I've been told in another area certain things about the phenomenon that are quite disturbing. I mean there are a lot of people privately claiming to me things about the implications of the phenomenon that go beyond... far beyond the whole notion of just... i mean i wish it was as simple as extraterrestrials getting in their little spaceships and flying from zeta reticuli and coming to this planet. That's the easy explanation.\n\n> Coulthart: The explanation that i've been exploring in recent months is more complex and i've already spoken about this to some extent so i will say it involves the notion of future human... time travel. And look it's only hypothetical, i'm not i'm not saying it's real, but if what i'm being told about that is true then... yeah i would be somber too.\n\n> Curt Jaimungal: Why is that somber why is the fact or the potential that it might be humans in the future terrifying?\n\n> Coulthart: Because of what it... well i think i wouldn't be giving too much away if i said that... (just watch the video for more)\n\nYou may think \"oh this interview was a year ago\". But Coulhart has said that it was a 2 or 3 year process to first talk to people around whistleblower David Charles Grusch, and then to Grusch himself. These people around Grusch were already telling Coulthart about the program. So even though the interview is a year old, i think it is based on the information of those sources.\n\nAlso i can imagine that time travel would be one of the things that Grusch (if he knows about it) is absolutely forbidden to talk about or event hint at, because the implications.\n\n# The bodies\n\n[In the infographic about the program](https://i.imgur.com/ntwNlOu.jpg) we saw a hypothetical craft-mind interface (which Coulthart also speaks about). And that if such an interface is really possible, then it could also work on artificial bodies. And since the craft could exit the dimension (physical universe), and remove itself from all its causality, then in theory a pilot could spend many artificial lifetimes in such artificial bodies inside the craft, while no time passes in the physical universe. His real body would not age a second. When the interface connection is broken, he would return to his body as if waking up from a dream (if he has normal body at all).\n\n# Time travel\n\nIm not going to go too deep into time travel, because its too complicated, but think about how people sometimes say things like:\n\n> If I could go back in time, i would kill Hitler as a baby, and prevent WW2 50 million deaths\n\nNow imagine that a nuclear war happens somewhere in the future. Lets be optimistic and say 2035. Imagine this happens, 6 billion people die, but some survive. If such a nuclear war happens, that means that right now there are real life nuclear-hitlers walking around among our political leaders, diplomats, etc. And they are not \"just\" responsible for 50 million deaths, but for billions, including perhaps making the whole planet almost uninhabitable for a long period of time.\n\nSo suppose there are survivors, and somewhere in their future (lets say the year 8000) they develop this interdimensional/timetravel technology. They can use their minds to connect to a craft, and that craft is basically the eyes of their eyes through which they can observe other timeperiods. They might be particularly interested in our current timeperiod.\n\nWould they intervene, perhaps target such \"nuclear hitler\" individuals, or ones near them? If \"the program\" really developed mind-interface technologies, then maybe some sort of \"havanna syndrome\" inducing device is also possible.\n\nBut then you arrive at paradoxes, etc. so this is something for another topic.\n\n# Final words\n\nThis post focused mainly on human-made craft. Im not saying that all the craft that the whistleblower mentioned are human made, but some of them could be. If such a craft only contained artificial bodies, then those would not be human and so could be considered NHI. But they could still be human-made.\n\nOf course, if humans can create such technology, then other nonhuman intelligences could too, and perhaps be far better at it. All the craft could be from such nonhuman intelligences.",

                "Maybe they\u2019re coming from a parallel dimension in which all the beings are what we perceive as space craft.

Who knows, maybe over the course of human existence there have been people that accidentally slipped into their dimension and then they came here to try to figure out the \u201cUMOs\u201d (unidentified meat objects).  The entities we have found inside would be their attempt at replicating our \u201ctechnology\u201d.  Alternatively, if we are just meat spaceships to them, it would have to blow their mind that a large percentage of our body is made of materials that are not made of our own DNA.  They might think our gut flora are the entities running the show.

I am curious about how you came to the perspectives you elucidate in the first two infographics, because they are quite familiar to me from my own experience and training. The graphics are so important because it is really difficult to transmit these ideas to other humans without graphic examples of visualizations.\n\nIt is absolutely clear to me that a: the universe is an array of intelligences (or something beyond mere intelligences: transentience.) b: minds naturally form networks and the localization of this isn't anything like our models of a brain in a box, and c: there are a vast array of signalling protocols active that connect minds across worlds, time, and organisms. Effectively, the network of intelligences is 'outside of time' as we know it.\n\nSome images from *skyBook:* [*https://www.organelle.org/skyBook/skyBook.html*](https://www.organelle.org/skyBook/skyBook.html)\n\n[https://www.organelle.org/skyBook/scalar.gif](https://www.organelle.org/skyBook/scalar.gif)\n\n[https://www.organelle.org/skyBook/amaP.jpg](https://www.organelle.org/skyBook/amaP.jpg)\n\nMy recent essay on a similar principle I was educated in: [https://medium.com/p/abbdc780c93f/edit](https://medium.com/p/abbdc780c93f/edit)",

                "It appears that Coulthart is capitalizing on the information provided by Grusch. The current excitement hinges heavily on the veracity of Grusch's testimony. If Grusch's statements are accurate, then it lends credibility to some of the subsequent claims that Coulthart has come to accept as true. I believe there's ample room for multiple aspects of these accounts to be factual. Conversely, if Grusch isn't truthful, then it casts doubt on Coulthart's assertions as well. Essentially, it all boils down to whether or not the Government decides to disclose the truth.\r  \n\r  \nIt's been around 70 years since the purported Roswell incident, during which time the Government is believed to have been withholding the truth. I'm reminded of Tom Delonge's perspective, who suggested that everyone would eventually understand the reasons behind this secrecy and would appreciate it. After all, the truth might not be as pleasant as we would hope.\r  \n\r  \nMany of the recent revelations align strikingly with the narrative in Tom's \"Sekret Machines\" books: the mental connection with the crafts, the decoy bodies. Perhaps Tom was sharing a slice of truth, maybe he was granted a glimpse into the reality. I'm inclined to think that we're being gradually prepared for this revelation, and now might be the right time for it. The reasoning behind this timing is still uncertain, but I suspect that too will become clear in due course.",

He even has memories as a child being accepted to a \"school\" and remembers his first visit at 5 years old.  Then, all he remembers after that is a normal life.  Except he did continue going to this \"school\".  He thinks they split his consciousness.  One had a normal life, and the other trained.  He has fleeting memories of his time in the school while also knowing he couldn't have been there. I will try and find the interview.",

                "I have noticed a lot of people think of them as nearly God's or omnipotent.  I sincerely doubt that is the case. They obviously have extremely advanced technology. But that doesn't necessarily mean they are advanced in every other way.  They may be just as flawed and fucked up as us. Just in different ways.",
                "A lot of people seem to accept that they are biologically fused with their technology, so I'll work with that.\n\nLet's assume their brains are room temperature quantum computers (LK-99 is good evidence for this but we've always believed this to be possible).\n\nFor every 1 qubit that you add, you double the computing power of a quantum computer in terms of the equivalent silicon computing power measured in bits.  So a quantum computer could only be simulated by an ordinary computer with a minimum size, and after adding 10 qubits to the quantum computer the minimum simulating ordinary computer would have to have 1024 times as many bits.  This is because quantum computing at its core isn't powerful because it's computing in parallel universes (claims of this are so full of hyperbole as to be wrong) but because the entanglement of N qubits produces 2^N possible states, and each of these states is equivalent to a classical bit under some restrictions.\n\nThis means quantum compututational AI will scale in power according to a double exponential growth rate, while classical AI (not accounting for change in the algorithms) will follow an exponential law like Moore's law.\n\nTo put it another way, imagine a lotus upon a pond that each day doubles, and the following day all of its offspring double, like clockwork.  This is an alright model for some species, and an even better model for (classical) computational growth.\n\nAfter just 1 month, the lotuses (loti?) will number 1 billion, and assuming each lotus is 4 inches across that would be enough to cover a small 4 square mile pond.  After 2 months there would be enough to completely cover 100 Earths.  Any size you can think of will typically be reached quickly, but it still takes an infinite amount of time to reach an infinite surface area (or transistor die count).\n\nFor quantum computing the situation is entirely different.  Now imagine that not only are the lotuses doubling (the equivalent classical computing power doubles with each qubit), they're also doing so in half the amount of time each time (we need exponentially less time to add single qubits to a system for the same reason as transistors on a die).  So the lotus doubles on day 1, then doubles again to four after 1.5 days, then 8 on 1.75 days, 16 on 1.875, and so on.  If you keep doing this, you never actually reach 2 days, but with a near infinite number of doublings you can get arbitrarily close (it's like Zeno's paradox).  \n\nIn otherwords, a doubly exponential growth rate hits a literal infinite singularity in only a finite amount of time.  When people talk of the singularity, they're referring to a point where an AI has become so smart that all of humanity combined is like an ant to them, and further intelligence doesn't really make a difference because it's basically magic anyways.  However with a quantum computational AI, you would have a literal infinite intelligence after a predictable amount of time, or at least you would be on track to up to a certain size of computer when you'd have to start worrying about a black hole forming because of information entropy (and assuming GPT performance/intelligence scaling with parameters/memory stays consistent).  \n\nIn our case the time to infinite computational power was 2 days, but presently it looks like the doubling rate time period is significantly slower than classical computers still.  When you account for the necessary error correction it's even smaller, by a third roughly.  As long as the time to infinity isn't billions of years, it's a very safe guess that any alien species that has traveled to us has already hit the technological point of infinite intelligence on demand and merged with it.  \n\nWhat this could mean in terms of consciousness is almost frightening to think about.  Could you reach an infinitieth \"level\" of conscious awareness as well?  Would actually reaching this state of infinite consciousness basically be divinity, and would it require an infinite amount of matter compressed into a black hole the size of a brain to actually reach, or is nearly infinite consciousness good enough?  Would quantum gravitational effects or closed timelike curves become important?  String theory?  Holographic duality?  At some point the quantum computer would thermalize away as Hawking radiation, but the holographic dual of a black hole is a thermal quantum state of entangled particles on the Universe's own event horizon, so maybe it is possible to still have a quantum computer even then.\n\nIf every alien has a nearly infinitely powerful quantum computer in their head that they can very quickly scale up, then any \"god\" that they build will never be good enough and will always need more computational power to be a better representation of infinite intelligence *TO THEM*.  Imagine an iPhone that becomes obsolete milliseconds after you buy it.",
                "Meh, for us at least technology vastly outpaces brain evolution. We are a small step from crows, elephants and dolphins.\n\nWhat changed is our tools. Specifically fire. Lead us to evolve smaller jaws for better communication and then ee could communicate and teach tool use in whole new ways.\n\nIn the last 10k ish years dog, cow and human brains have shrunk at about the same rate over the same period. Its logical nomadic people had to individually know more about the world and have a broader skill set. Sedentary people began to specializr and now hyper specialize. Imagine being a chef, a botanist, a hunter, a craftsman a tool maker, a wayfinder an adventurer, a rope maker, a leather worker, tanner, butcher, fletcher.... Just to survive. Whereas folks making say pottery would specialize in that and not necessarily need all the above skills. Now in our world people hyper specialize. Sillicon valley tech bros may not be able to build their own tables and raise their own livestock (not saying they are incapable but mor eof they put their energy to more profitable persuits) and probably dont do their own cleaning or car maintenence.\n\nWe also expect them to be like monks pushing the forefront of consiousness? Nah. For a whole society to grow takes an achingly long time for info to dissimiate into 'public consiousness'. Take Einstein for example: we can all quote something or other from his work a hundred years ago or how Shakespear's language is often common parlance. However not everyone can quote Boar or Chomsky and probably wont for a century or more. Thays also assuming they have one language and culture, Shakespeare is centuries old but im willing to bet very few people in Uzbeckistan quote him directly (although im sure they have more local or culturally appropriate comparisons).\n\nIf there are aliens visiting they are more likely pilots and mechanics than poets, philosophers or monks/meditators. Do they have a higher culture or consiousness to share? Or are they looking for work in a slow economic period and think they can make bank fixing toilets at 200x speed?",
                "I think intelligent thought becomes something completely different when telepathy is achieved. You go from being independent minded to having others being able to read your thoughts and vice versa. Once this happens, is there a way to block out others from reading your thoughts? I'm not sure. Either way, species capable of this would over time have a greater understanding of themselves, and anything learned is potential shared knowledge.

Ergo we have more potential than any other animals to become like aliens, or at least serve a purpose more useful than being food to aliens in the shortest amount of time.  \n\nThere does still exist a lot of backward thinking among humanity, mostly due to old traditions and our animal selfish/survival instinct.   There's still cannibal tribes out there.  They'd probably ask the aliens if they can join them in eating us.  Just because humanity as a whole has reached certain levels of morality does not mean every human has also gotten there.

If animals help outside of their self and family, it\u2019s accidental(bees pollination, they gather pollen for food, but \u201caccidentally\u201d spread it elsewhere) or anecdotal.\n\nI think also you could draw the morality line at instinctual behavior. Does a human live it\u2019s life instinctually like animals? Or do we think, posterize, theorize, and go outside the bounds of our instincts.",

            "selftext": "\n\nNote: I am not high (I promise)\n\nThe recent UFO hearings in Congress have all but confirmed the existence of extraterrestrial life and their presence here. However, it's not just their advanced technology that captures our imagination; have you ever wondered what their world might actually be like?? Do they have societal norms, hobbies, entertainment? What do they do on their world??  It\u2019s funny to me that we\u2019ve been obsessing over UFO reports and possible crash landings etc but never truly allowing ourselves to build on that reality by accepting it as truth. I no longer need anymore proof about whether or not they exist and started to think..  Wtf do these guys do when they go back home?!  They don\u2019t LIVE in the UFO..  it\u2019s just a vehicle..  Right?!  Wtf is their home planet like?!\n\nSocietal Norms:\nJust like us on Earth, it's reasonable to assume that aliens probably have societal norms. However, these norms might be shaped by their unique biology, environment, and cultural perspectives. They may emphasize cooperation and mutual respect, valuing harmony within their communities. Maybe they have a strong reverence for nature and prioritize sustainability, setting high standards for protecting their planet.\n\nHobbies and Entertainment:\nWhile we can only speculate, it's likely that beings from an alien world engage in various hobbies and forms of entertainment. Perhaps they have intricate art forms that incorporate bioluminescence or advanced holographic technology, allowing them to create visual experiences far beyond our imagination. It's also possible that they engage in intellectual pursuits, such as advanced forms of scientific research and exploration or say..  abductions?!\n\nWork and Leisure:\nGiven their advanced technology and potential for interstellar travel, it's safe to assume that aliens might have access to a vast array of employment opportunities. Their occupations might range from scientists and engineers to artists and diplomats. Just like us, they could have a work-life balance, making time for leisure activities and personal growth. It's fascinating to contemplate the possibilities of what this leisure time could entail on an alien world.\n\nEnvironment and Exploration:\nThe environment of an alien world could vastly differ from ours. They might inhabit planets with multiple moons, reside on massive space stations, or even thrive in environments that challenge our understanding of habitability. Exploration of their world could involve intricately designed spacecraft, capable of traversing vast distances efficiently and safely. They may have discovered entirely different forms of energy and have harnessed them for sustainable use.\n\nCommunication and Relationship Building:\nFor advanced extraterrestrial civilizations, communication would be key. Maybe they have developed intricately sophisticated forms of communication, incorporating sound, telepathy, or a combination of both. They would likely value empathy, understanding, and cooperation in building relationships with individuals from different cultures and species. Their civilizations might be characterized by a deep societal unity and global cooperation, working together for the betterment of all but do they laugh?!  Do they have a sense of humor? \n\nUltimately, our speculations about the alien world remain firmly rooted in our creative imaginations. While the recent UFO hearings have provided a glimpse into the presence of extraterrestrial life, our understanding of their world is still limited. Yet, it's important to remember that the complexity and diversity of life in the universe is likely far beyond our current comprehension.\n\nBut what do you guys think?!  Has anyone else thought deeply about this??\n\nTL;DR: Beyond the technology of their crafts, it's intriguing to ponder the societal norms, hobbies, entertainment, and everyday life on an alien world.",

I'm still debating whether I should read it or not.\n\nTo me, it seems that if there's any truth to the idea of UFOs and religion, then humans have created religion to try to explain the phenomenon as best they can but that doesn't mean that our explanation is 100% correct. Perhaps it has some elements of truth but the rest of it just purely made up by us to control and subjugate the population.\n\nKeep in mind that these religious accounts of the phenomenon date back to hundreds of years ago, if not a thousands, so people back then had no understanding of technology and they had to explain things within the framework they had at the time which was religion. But now, we live in a mostly secular society and we have a new lens with which to understand the phenomenon and that is technology.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? Have you read the book? Is there any credibility to the link between the UFO phenomenon and religion?",

The two I\u2019d recommend are Ezra Klein\u2019s and Theories of Everything.\n\n2) Pasulkas thesis is a lot more nuanced than \u201cancient aliens are the basis of religion\u201d. She\u2019s mapping out an emerging system of belief based around technology and UFOs. There\u2019s some fascinating ideas in there about gnosis and direct experience vs the mediated dogma of religious institutions, as well as our fundamental relationship with technology.\n\n3) Yes, she also illustrates how religious texts can be reinterpreted through a UFO lens, but she\u2019s a big fan of Vall\u00e9e, so her take is not that we\u2019ve mistaken aliens for gods.

            "selftext": "There\u2019s been some discussion about how UFOs are possibly some kind of top secret government project that we don\u2019t know about, in other words, they are real but they\u2019re not alien and that\u2019s the end of it.\n\nWhat I want to do is debunk that idea, because it doesn\u2019t really make any sense when you think about it. UFOs have been seen by Air Force and Navy personnel pulling off maneuvers that violate the laws of physics and doing things that the government freely admits they shouldn\u2019t be able to do.\n\nNow let\u2019s say for a second that China or Russia has been working on some super secret aircraft program that we don\u2019t know about. Even if that\u2019s true, I know those countries have a lot of really smart scientists and China in particular has a lot of really impressive technological advances under its belt, but I don\u2019t think they\u2019re 300 years ahead of the rest of the world and I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve figured out how to break the laws of physics.\n\nBut hey, let\u2019s say there was some major breakthrough on their part. Do you know why I still don\u2019t think they created the UFOs?\n\nChina has been vocal about wanting Taiwan back and I really don\u2019t understand how that would be hard for them or a challenge they need to overcome if they have this level of technology at their disposal. Same with Russia because if they had it too, the war would be over by now.\n\nAnd I\u2019ll go one step further and point out the cases of UFOs disabling nuclear missiles remotely. We know it\u2019s happened at least one military base and if a foreign country had that ability, mutually assured destruction goes right out the window and no one is safe. \n\nIn other words, not only is this level of technology beyond any of us, it\u2019s just absurd that it wouldn\u2019t be used in war by now.",

Gravity's effect does dilate time, but anti gravity would just nigate the dilation. To reverse time, you need to go fast. Very fast. In fact you need to travel faster than the speed of light which as far as we know is impossible.\n\nAs fantastic as it sounds, I'm sceptical of the visitors from the future theory, at least, travellers from our future.\n\nIts an age old problem that simply cannot be reconciled, the idea of the temporal pardox. I.e somebody travelling from the future affecting an event in the past that ultimately would result in a future where time travel to the past is impossible. The classic example being travelling back in time and killing your own grandfather, meaning you were never born and thus are not able to travel back in time to kill him.\n\nThere are theories of using the universes geometry to create a path to the past, but again the paradox problem is looming.\n\nTherefore to get around the paradox problem, any time travel into the past would land you in an alternative universe, where the paradox nolonger matters because the future will take place in an entirely different universe.\n\nFinally, the universe could be completely deterministic. What has happened was always going to happen, and what will happen is already set in stone. Thus you cannot go into the past and change events to such a degree that they would cause paradoxes, no matter how hard you try. Any events you change were always meant to be changed by a time traveller from the future.  This is actually supported by observed behavior of electrons in an advanced form of the double slit experiment, where by they exhibit behavior that indicates they have advanced knowledge of the decisions of observers in the future even before that decision has been made by the observer themselves. This either means they travel back in time to alter their past behavior, OR they always knew what would happen in the future and therefore PLAN their behavior.\n\nWhichever theory you subscribe to, antigravity does not reverse time, it merely negates the effects of gravity.",

One general rule that after time travel has taken place - the total number of copies of me, counted across all universes, is unchanged.\"\n\n\"Asking to interact with past environments means asking to change them, which means, by definition, asking to be in a different snapshot of it from the one we remember. Parallel universes don\u2019t have hidden serial numbers they are distinguished only by what happens in them. This means that visitors from the future cannot know our future any more than we can, for they did not come from there. But they can still tell us about the future of their universe, whose past was identical to ours \"\n\n\"Which of your billions of pasts do you wish to travel to, my friend? And tell, how many of do you remember? All those pasts converge into a single present, so wherever you go back in time, and whatever you do once there, your present will remain the same. And tell us, to which of the billions of futures do you wish to travel, and what for?

Barney pressed down hard on the accelerator and sped away as quickly as he could. Betty would turn around to see if she could observe the frightening object. She would wind down her passenger window. As soon as she did, **both she and Barney could hear bizarre and unnerving \u201cbeeping and buzzing\u201d sounds. A strange sensation ran through each of their bodies,** while the car appeared to \u201cvibrate\u201d in sympathy to the strange noises from outside.\n\n**Suddenly each of them began to feel a strange \u201cdullness\u201d come over their senses. Their minds and concept of their surroundings were also dulled.** They had the feeling they weren\u2019t entirely in control.\n\n**Suddenly, the unsettling beeps and buzzing sounds snapped the Hills back to their senses.** Barney\u2019s hands were still on the wheel of the car, but they had no idea where they were. They would later discover they were around 35 miles south of their previous location in the Ashland area. What was even more unnerving, neither of them could recall how they had gotten here. The last memory they had was of winding down the windows and the strange noises filling their ears. The only solid memory each of them had was of making a sudden turn in the road. There, they would encounter a roadblock. And a \u201cfiery orb\u201d in the middle of the road directly in front of them.\n\n\\*End excerpt\\*\n\nJUNE 1978, FELLING, COUNTY DURHAM, IRELAND. Below is an excerpt from a report by British UFO researcher Jenny Randles.\n\n\\*Start excerpt\\*\n\nBritish ufologist Jenny Randles reportedly indicated that in Felling, County Durham, Ireland, on June 1978, at 03:50 a.m., a person was awoken in her bed **by a buzzing, high-pitched noise that vibrated through her body almost like an electric shock. Her head felt like it would explode.**\n\nThen an unseen figure held her wrist. **The witness was paralyzed and could not move** but could see that the figure had a fuzzy aura surrounding it. A bluish light was bathing the room....\n\n(snip)\n\nSuddenly the creature disappeared and she was again able to move.\n\n\\*End excerpt\\*\n\nNow, here is a link to a science article dated today (May 25th 2023), titled \"Scientists develop powerful \u2018pulses\u2019 that can induce immediate \u2018hibernation\u2019...\":\n\n[Scientists develop powerful \u2018pulses\u2019 that can induce immediate \u2018hibernation\u2019 \u2013 and it could help us explore space (msn.com)](https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/other/scientists-develop-powerful-pulses-that-can-induce-immediate-hibernation-and-it-could-help-us-explore-space/ar-AA1bGHPC?ocid=msedgntp&cvid=ec52b094bc52429caee08f961b0c71f4&ei=74)\n\nHere are some quotes from the article:\n\n\\*Start quotes\\*\n\nScientists have developed new **ultrasound technology that can induce immediate \u201chibernation**\u201d, they say.\n\nThe researchers behind the new system successfully brought it on in mice and rats, **after pointing the ultrasound pulses at the animals\u2019 heads**.\n\n**They suggest that it could work in humans** \u2013 and might have important applications for long-distance space flight or medicine, they say.\n\nWhile further work is needed to understand how it might work on people, they suggest that it could be used when people have experienced acute emergencies or severe disease, for instance. **If someone is in a car accident, for instance, they could essentially be put on ice until their organs are used for transplantation**, for instance.\n\n**The scientists found that directing ultrasound pulses at mice\u2019s heads for around 10 seconds brought on the same conditions as torpor,** with their heart rate slowing, their body temperature cooling and their metabolism slowing.\n\nThe work is described in a new paper, \u2018Induction of a torpor-like hypothermic and hypometabolic state in rodents by ultrasound\u2019, published in Nature.\n\n\\*End quotes\\*\n\nSo, an obvious question arises...If researchers are just now discovering this science in 2023...then who would have had mastery of this technology back in the 1960s and 70s?",

So they can effectively travel great distances quickly, but the trip would feel very long to any passengers on board. So it would be best for unmanned drones. But this would also explain how they create no sonic booms despite traveling faster than sound to outside observers.",

This contradicts the thermal patterns seen with anything using classical propulsion methods. If a gravity drive needs to \"flip\" its local relative field to stay aloft above the earth, then maybe this is a side effect seen by outside observers.\n\nI don't think this is a farfetched idea at all.",

Well, after doing some digging I came across a company called Battelle which specializes in aerospace science which is located right next to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. I have come to the conclusion that this is one of the companies he said he \"can't name specifically\" when referring to these companies examining extraterrestrial objects. Now you might be asking, \"Where's the proof of this claim?\" Well, I found an article coming from the GOVERNMENT talking about confidential treatment requested by the \"Alien Technology Corp\" which is subsidized by Battelle. If you'd like to see the entire \"confidential\" document you can read it here:  \n[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1350415/000119312506121612/dex1028.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1350415/000119312506121612/dex1028.htm)  \n\n\nPlease let me know your thoughts or tell me I'm crazy....  \nNote to mods please approve this post I'm a long time lurker around Reddit :)",

And of course everyone's favorite to name, Lockheed Martin. But there may be companies involved that no one would suspect, where just one small division of the company is working on projects. Many people, even within the division, may have no idea it is from extraterrestrial origin, depending on what their specific job is.",

This is a coincidence or worse a red herring. \n\nIf there are physical crafts, it will be something with the brand appeal of slightly expired milk. The entire company will smell like beige looks. These folks know better than to draw attention to themselves, even as a joke.",
                "Alien Technology Corp claims to be an RFID company when in reality they spent 20 years commercializing a concept called fluidic self-assembly where millions of individual electronic components are suspended in a fluid and they self-assemble/self-align into the final product. I grew up not far from their headquarters and there was always a rumor about the name and it's implications locally.  I'm sure they are using it to make RFID products, but the company has really been able to survive this long by licensing the technology out to other manufacturers to make things like displays, memory, micro antenna arrays, etc.. Sure sounds like one of those crash retrieval technologies that took a long time to figure out but is only now starting to find practical applications. There have been many experiencer reports of UFO/UAP displaying evidence at least some of them are composed of micromachines or depend on micromachines for some part of their technology. These are often referred to as \"grey goo\" nanotechnologies. The nefarious uses alone for the ability to manufacture millions of electronic devices smaller than can be seen with the naked eye makes me shudder to think about.",

Kinda goes without saying, but a secret group who studies alien technology isn\u2019t going to literally label themselves by that name lol (or make themselves publicly visible, as this one must be since you found them.)

The degree to which intelligence is associated with it varies, and is a specific mode of intelligence. I strongly suspect that any actually enlightened intelligences would (mostly) be quite wary of machines. Not necessarily because they are intrinsically 'bad'; rather, it appears that they 'become their own justification' and lead to disastrous 'redefinition of what it means to be alive'. Additionally, the environmental impact (even if energy itself is 'free').  \n\n\nNot only do I not know how to make an iphone, someone (who is bright) 100 years ago given that technology would be able to accomplish miracles with it, consistently. What do I actually do with my phone? Most of it is embarrassing from the standpoint of anything actually resembling intelligence.  \n\n\nConsider the group-effort expended to create and sustain technology on Earth. With 1/100th of that we could completely solve all human problems, and probably advance into something that actually resembles intelligent societies. As a species we are 'dumping' our developmental momentum into machines. What could go wrong? We're literally 'skipping' the developmental milestones we could together easily achieve for the sake of building more and more powerful machines. AI is effectively an attempt to produce a mechanical god. Or a whole library of them. Did anyone ever consider that this kind of investment means the end of life on Earth? Complex life, at least.  \n\n\nThere's so much more to say, but I'll pause there to reflect on these matters. Technology isn't intelligence, and if you don't get to the first base, the second will certainly teach you that you should have, if there's anyone left to learn the lesson.",

There is only so much a person can learn in their life, and so we specialize in a field because there isn't enough time to become an expert in many areas. \n\nWe don't know how long they live, but the more technology advances, the more there is to learn, and we are born knowing nothing. Assuming they are also born knowing nothing, most may only learn how to use the tech, not the details of how it works. \n\nOnce AI gets involved in designing, we may eventually end up using things that no human fully understands. Thousands of years later, we may have technology that we have no idea exactly where it came from or how it works. We just inherited it from the work of previous generations and AI inventors."

Astral projection is \"remote consciousness localisation\", ejecting the astral body out of the physical body, and arbitrarily navigating around the astral plane with no need for fuel or any other technological concerns. Teleportation could conceivably be a generalization of Astral Projection in the added case that the physical body is also taken along for the ride through the astral plane.

It happened. And it was a stupid, phony cover-up that General Ramey was ordered by Washington to institute in order to shut the story down as quick as possible because of what they had recovered. It was pretty spectacular. They just didn\u2019t want it getting out to the Soviets and anybody else that they had recovered that craft and the bodies. So yeah, we\u2019ve got a crash retrieval and Roswell was there. And I disagree with John Alexander when he says that he couldn\u2019t find any evidence of it. But Phil Corso made clear that there was evidence. I\u2019ve done background investigation on Phil Corso that went beyond what John was capable of doing and I verified Corso\u2019s story and verified every word he said about Roswell. So, it happened.\"\n\nErica Lukes (Interviewer): \"And I just gotta clarify because people hear Corso and their hackles come up. I think that probably his book was embellished by Bill Birnes but correct me if I\u2019m wrong.\"\n\nDr. Eric Davis: \"Yeah. If you read the hand-written manuscript that Phil wrote of his autobiography, you\u2019ll find the very small section in the book where he talks about the Roswell crash. How when he was a retired civilian, his good buddy, Lt. General Arthur Trudeau, had hired him at the Army research agency. It has been long time since I read this story so I might get a bit of the details wrong. His job as a civilian was to handle the crash retrieval materials and assign them out to the various defense contractors for analysis and reverse engineering studies. And so that proved out to be true. And so, it\u2019s there. And there were several other crash retrievals that have happened after that.\"\n\nDavis goes on to describe the so-called 'Collins Elite,' as unorganized, small cliques and individual fundamentalist, evangelical Christians within the government & DoD, who think UFOs and their occupants are satanic and their technology is demonic. Whenever these folks are in the chain of command, they will do everything within their power to expose, obstruct, block and shut down any program related to UFOs/UAPs.

            "selftext": " I went to war with ChatGPT as an experiment to learn about it and to ask it questions I ponder every day.  Personally, I know we are not alone, its complex and its extraordinarily different from what we know and who we are and what we are willing to accept.  How do we as a species cross this immense gulf?  AI is proscience.  If you can't prove it with science it doesn't exist - screw the fact that humans have been reporting this throughout history.  Screw the Drake Equation.  Hard science.  So, then I asked what if only some of the scientists can perceive the aliens/extraterrestrials/ultraterrestrials/phenomon - whatever the heck this thing is - here's an interesting answer:\n\nYou raise an important point about the potential conflict between subjective reports and the scientific method. The scientific method relies on empirical evidence, objectivity, and replicability, which can be challenging when dealing with subjective experiences that cannot be universally perceived.\n\nIn a situation where scientists with enhanced neural attributes perceive extraterrestrials, and others cannot, collaboration may require a nuanced approach. Here are a few considerations:\n\n1. Validation through empirical data: While subjective experiences alone may not be sufficient to establish scientific validity, scientists with enhanced perception could focus on gathering empirical data to support their claims. This could involve capturing and analyzing various forms of evidence, such as audio recordings, video footage, environmental measurements, or any other objective data that can be obtained in the presence of extraterrestrials.\n2. Controlled experiments and observations: Collaboration between scientists with different perceptual abilities can involve designing controlled experiments or observations that aim to capture measurable phenomena associated with the presence of extraterrestrials. By working together, scientists could identify specific aspects of the encounters that can be objectively studied, measured, and analyzed.\n3. Cross-validation and corroboration: Scientists from both groups can engage in cross-validation and corroboration efforts. This could involve conducting joint experiments or observations where the perceiving scientists guide the non-perceiving scientists to specific events or locations, allowing for a collective analysis of the available evidence.\n4. Interdisciplinary collaboration: Collaboration can extend beyond the field of perception itself. Scientists from various disciplines can contribute their expertise to understanding the broader context and implications of the extraterrestrial encounters. This interdisciplinary approach can help integrate different perspectives and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the phenomena.\n5. Replication and independent verification: Replication is a key principle of the scientific method. If the experiences and observations of the perceiving scientists can be reliably replicated by other scientists with enhanced neural attributes, it would strengthen the scientific case. Independent verification by researchers who can perceive the extraterrestrials would also lend credibility to the claims.\n6. Long-term research and investigation: Patience and long-term research efforts are important. Continued exploration, data collection, and analysis can contribute to building a more robust scientific understanding over time. Scientists from both groups can collaborate on long-term research projects that involve systematic observation, data collection, and analysis.\n\nIt is crucial to acknowledge that such a scenario presents unique challenges to the scientific method. Collaboration in this context would require a careful balance between subjective experiences and objective evidence. By employing rigorous scientific methodologies, emphasizing empirical data, replication, cross-validation, and interdisciplinary collaboration, scientists can work towards establishing a more comprehensive understanding of the phenomena while upholding the principles of the scientific method.",

I messed around with chatgpt myself and got a reasonable answer. \n\nSubjective reports make for great reads, but it's crash retrieval that ultimately bears fruit and ultimately you need evidence that can be carefully and repeatedly tested - unless you want to go and join the dubious amongst humanity, channeling angels who can never make persistent predictions nor reveal any historical facts or scientific proofs to confirm that they exist outside some guy's head while he tries to hock you a book using a hokey voice. \n\nHard science is doing the work of looking for the hard answers, not resting in the presumption of easy answers at the end of the day - something the ufo community are experts at unfortunately. You may have subjective reports, but you can only ever glean so much from them and you'd be a fool to try and lean into your bias before ever having proper objective evidence. \n\nThe best thing you can do is rationally collate cases that confidently fit into at least the six steps outlined, admit that you know less about the subject than you think and that governments know more than they let on and then lobby as an individual and part of groups for your governments to allow the dissemination of information and materials to scientists in the public and allow collaboration between them and the limited amount of one's behind top secret doors."

Hunter / Gatherers were still mostly in Africa but we were slowly migrating outward.\n\n3) Civilizations have only been around for around 6,000 years (if you start with Mesopotamia) -- That is a very short time compared to the entire history of humans.

That was a distinct genetic bottleneck that would have *strongly* favored specific traits. I imagine intelligence, social tendencies, inventiveness/creativity and some other traits that lended to survival in a harsh and changing environment would have been forced into the forefront by natural selection. This, in my mind, definitely had an impact on the population\u2019s behavior going forward. \n\nWhat happens after that is distinct innovation and a strong push outward.

Agriculture allowed for cities which allowed for higher populations and an educational system, which allowed for the smartest members of a large group of humans to grow and develop in an environment where they could use their intelligence in various fields to create inventions and further technology. Sharing ideas and building on past technology required written records. A complex divison of labor, good education, and good record keeping are essential. It took humans tens of thousands of years to figure out this basic framework. \n\nOnce it was set in place, wars and disease held humanity back for thousands of years. Achievements were made and then lost several times as advanced areas were conquered or destroyed and knowledge was lost.",
                "Our History is likely a pretty standard one among intelligent species. Things snowball.\n\n1. The brain power potential was identical. Its about a shared pool of knowledge and having numbers to enshrine and pass it on for following generations. If we dropped you into the world 100k years ago you would likely die in days. Drop any human on an island they are not going to be building radios out of coconuts like its an episode of Gilligan's. If you took a human baby from 100k brought it to the future, raised them on a modern diet with access to modern medicine you would find their intelligence to be identical to ours.\n2. What happened 50-70k years ago is not strange at all. Humans domesticated animals. The most significant being the wolf. We became much more deadlier when we had dogs at our command. As well as far more secure. This also lead to other domestication, hearding ect. This allowed us to gather more humans in one place which lead to specialization. We where at last able to take our most intelligent members and put them to work on thing other then staying alive.\n3. Civs probably go back at least double 6k years to 12k or so. We began the process of sharing knowledge both generationally and culturally via writing and trade.\n4. The progress the last few hundred years is not shocking. We have a large pool of humans to now fill specializations. As well as having developed the means to connect essentially everyone in the world with first ships then flight, and now instant global communication. \n\nIt makes me wonder about the whole \"aliens want depopulation\" stories. I mean if an alien civ wanted us to not be a threat ever... the easiest way would just to stunt our development.

To say that the Sumerians suddenly came up with a sophisticated writing system and centralised governance is a wild claim. They are the oldest civilisation we know of, but they most likely inherited their knowledge from preceding civilisations and improved upon it, we just haven't discovered it yet. You have no idea how much history lies buried under the sands of the Sahara. A vast region that once had the ideal climate for people and civilisations to thrive.  \nConsider how old Gobekli Tepe is. Sure, by academic definition it's not advanced enough to be called a civilisation, but there's a 6000 year difference between it and the Sumerians. SIX THOUSAND YEARS. Gobekli Tepe was as old to the Sumerians as Sumerian civilisation is for us today. And we shouldn't just fixate on this Gobekli Tepe, as I mentioned before, around the same time the Sahara was green, so there's a huge chance that there were much more impressive things going on down in the Sahara region than Gobekli Tepe, possibly an advanced (for the time) civilisation. Unfortunately, we may never know because of the harsh climate of this region today.",

It gave us longer lifespans, empowered communities to grow, enabled trade and basically gave birth to society. Medicine was also huge for us. As we grew, societies evolved allowing for even longer lifespans, and culture began to spread. Then we fought over land and God's for a few centuries. Then came the energy revolution, with the harnessing of steam to create electricity, lightbulbs so the workday can go late into the night, communication like the telephone and radio. All of these things add to the exponential growth we were already experiencing.

This was waay back, around 350,000 years ago, as OP found out. You see something shiny, something you\u2019ve never seen before. You\u2019re afraid of it, but even more curious. You pick up this object, and your mind tries to understand what it is. All of a sudden, something speaks to you from the sky, though you don\u2019t know any form of sophisticated language, you listen in awe. Then it disappears, but the object is still in your hand. \n\nYou go back to your hut, you inspect the object more. Some tribal members join you to discover what the object can be used for, to no prevail. The next day, you get up and go to the same place you found the object, to summon the being that spoke to you. In your head you think it\u2019s just some animal you\u2019ve never seen before, and the object is just another rock you\u2019ve never seen before. So you make some noise and the being doesn\u2019t answer, you do everything you can, but you\u2019re exhausted. \n\nThen you start to think, what if I offered the most valuable thing to me to purchase a visit? Maybe this being gave me something, and wants something of mine in return. So you go out hunting, kill an animal, bring it to the site, and offer it. The being summons itself and in its fiery form shoots a flame at the dead animal. The animals cooks in the fire, and the being disappears. You look at the dead animal, it looks different. You smell it, it smells better than raw, so you taste it, and it tastes way better, and is much easier to tear off. You are perplexed. \n\nNow every time you kill an animal, you go to the site, and the animal sets on fire. Something different happens after a while. Soon you\u2019re curious about the flame, so you grab a stick and put it in the way of the beings flame. The top of the stick catches fire, as you stare in amazement. You run around in a circle, amazed that you have harnessed the flame on a stick. The flan then slowly dies out. So you go and sacrifice another animal, but this time there\u2019s no flame. After years of going to the sacrifice location, you become frustrated. You grab a stick, point it to the sun, no luck. You grab another stick and try it again, no luck. You run type sticks together in frustration, and as it smokes, you throw the sticks to a a dry area below you. The things in the area start to burn.\n\nEventually you\u2019ve received enough knowledge and start using that knowledge to build, to speak, to write. You build monumental structures where you originally had found something way more advanced than you. Then civilization reaches its peak, and topples over. The next civilization re-emerges, but with watered down versions of the knowledge the OG civilizations had. Someone somehow figured out that a sacrifice was needed, they do it, and receive knowledge. \n\nYou can see where I\u2019m going with this.",

Sure, coming to terms with a non-human intelligence is worldview shaking, but I say, don't be afraid of \"the others\", regardless of their intentions. \n\nWhat scares me is that this whole thing goes underground for another 70 years, that we have a repeat of Project Blue Book. I don't think we can afford that as a species. As mentioned by Jeremy Corbell and George Knapp in episode 30 of Weaponized, \"(David Grusch) has been effectively muzzled this coming week.\" \n\nIf the truth is stifled, there is so much more to fear. If their intentions are hostile, how can we prepare or respond if the truth is hidden? If their intentions are noble, we truly should fear those in power for keeping this information for so long, potentially to the detriment of the development of the human race.\n\nWe can't let this happen. We have to keep the conversation going and the pressure on US congress. If this is swept under the carpet through smear campaigns and political slight-of-hand, and public interest wanes, we lose. We lose the ability to prepare / respond appropriately, and if some people in the UFO community are to be believed, we lose access to technology that could transform the planet supposedly over night. \n\nIf ever there was a time for disclosure, it's now.

                "I\u2019m not sure where I stand on Aliens or rather the extent of Aliens and other life beyond our solar system, but I joined this sub out\u2019ve a growing curiosity. I grew up in church all my life and had very religious family and likewise was part of a likeminded community. I had always had my doubts about their faith and whether or not any of it could be possible, until finally I got old enough and decided not to subscribe to their beliefs any longer. I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m an atheist per se, but I don\u2019t know what \u201chigher power\u201d I believe in. \n\nI feel like Aliens are just as plausible as the idea of there being some otherworldly and all-powerful God. Not really having a stake in the UFO/NHI community at all up until recently, I never really mulled over the implications of such beings actually existing - other than various times throughout my 29 years of life, I have gone back and forth about why it does or doesn\u2019t make sense that we are the only organic life forms in a could-be endlessly sprawling universe. With the recent Congressional hearings and the revived interest in MH370, my curiosity has been piqued. To finally get to the point of your post - even if the higher ups in government do come forward and give some kind of irrefutable disclosure that Aliens do in fact walk among us and have visited our planet for centuries, I don\u2019t get why that means we should automatically be afraid either. If they are in fact real and the sightings and encounters that have been reported for years and years do have actual merit after all, it doesn\u2019t change anything. They will have been here when we didn\u2019t know for certain that they existed and would have likely been doing whatever it is they intended to be doing while they were. \n\nThe only thing that changes is the fact that we would now know. Maybe the fear is that they will shrug off any attempts to be covert and subtle because they will know that we all know for sure that they are indeed real. I don\u2019t know that there was anything they gained by being undetectable, but maybe the fear is that once they have no reason to hide, they will just do as they please and maybe there is this overwhelming assumption that their true intent with no reason to hold back is malicious. I obviously can\u2019t say one way or the other if that would be the case. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary to automatically assume they are inherently evil though. How can we? We don\u2019t even know what something that has universally been considered fiction actually being real looks like. All we have to go on is the sci-fi creations that nonhuman life comes to conquer and destroy. Fiction actually being fact would open an avenue for having to rethink and accept possibilities the majority of us have never had any reason to give head-space to. \n\nIf Aliens are outright proven to be real, it\u2019s going to be way more dynamic and complicated to process than just wanting to know if they\u2019re here in peace. By all accounts from what info we have to go on - that seems to be the case - barring any evidence that we don\u2019t know about - activities of an insidious nature that we have no reason to go looking for or no way to uncover, etc. Unless full disclosure happens and we are told as a collective that yes, Aliens exist, yes we\u2019ve been covering up things for decades, this is the state of their existence, what they are doing, what their agenda is and we have nothing to do but comply - I think getting scared and fearing the worst is premature. If they\u2019ve been here all along, at least with what knowledge we have now, nothing has been done that has seen us being routinely exterminated. \n\nUntil we are given a reason to know that we have something to fear, I don\u2019t know how we can fear the still very much unclear and majority unknown. \n\nJust my take as someone very slowly getting their \u201care they or aren\u2019t they\u201d feet wet again. Whatever the truth is - I think we should have the right to know as well. Even if it is that we are all cattle to these beings and are being slowly marched to absolute extinction, we should get to know. It wouldn\u2019t change the fact that we would have existed none the wiser otherwise, only to absolutely lose our minds when the day comes and they reveal themselves and pull the trigger. The government would be dealing with a panic one way or the other. One scenario would just have it held off until it was obviously too late. Again though, that\u2019s leaning into the assumption that we have something to fear. If we do or don\u2019t, I would just like to know if they\u2019re real. \n\nIt would provide some kind of grounding for me personally because I doubt anyone will ever be able to prove the existence of God, at least as described in the Bible. Maybe the Aliens are the God of the Bible. I don\u2019t know, but I would like to. Sorry for rambling!

They may or may not make a habit of abducting people for non consensual medical tests. \n\nWe\u2019re missing information, pieces of the puzzle, certainly. But at the end of the day, we don\u2019t really understand their motives, their way of thinking, their reasoning and culture. \n\nSometimes fear is an understandable response. Maybe they\u2019ll annihilate us to reset their experiment if we force disclosure. Maybe they\u2019ll invade. Maybe they\u2019ll throw a \u201cwelcome to the federation\u201d party.

                "If I can chime in with a dream I had that made me switch from thinking I could handle this, to not being so sure.\n\nMake fun of the story as you wish but I was practicing lucid dreaming for about a year when I was in my early 20s. I was experiencing a sort of spiritual awakening if you will where I meditated a few times a week, researched spiritual teachers like ekhart tolle, can\u2019t remember his first name but Ruiz the guy that wrote the 4 agreements, etc. Nothing all that crazy.\n\nI was getting really good at lucid dreaming. My trick was I trained myself to pinch myself pretty hard multiple times throughout the day which would trigger the response of pain and affirm myself that I am indeed awake. Almost like inception with the thing they spin. Well, there were times when I pinched myself and I felt nothing, I would do it again even harder, and nothing. This was my cue to remind myself in the dream that I am dreaming, and I can now go to work.\n\nI started simple with the jumping through the air flying type stuff which I have to say is my favorite. Then I started interacting with my dreams as they were happening and being able to control what was going on, manipulating objects into existence, talking to loved ones (which was the beginning of my uncomfort as my mother passed from cancer and lots of friends who have moved on too, the dreams were a lot to process once I woke up), etc etc.\n\nWell I stumbled upon that crazy ass Barbra marciniak lady (get your jokes in now, I was vulnerable spiritually) and read the bringers of the dawn book. It\u2019s a pretty wild read and to do a tl;Dr on it, she claims to be spiritually in communication with beings called the Pleiadians from the Pleiades star system. Essentially they want to help humans prepare for a spiritual awakening and goes into briefly regarding the history of our planet (again, not commenting on the validity of said book). \n\nWell, that, coupled with my interest in the alien topic, had me think that I would like to try and communicate myself. If barbra can do it, why can\u2019t I? I devised a plan for my next lucid dream experience, to try and meditate in my dream and project myself to any beings that would be willing to communicate. Tisk tisk.\n\nA short time goes by and I find myself lucid dreaming in a setting that is literally my house, my road, at night, almost like I am still sleeping physically but just wondering around spiritually. No I never saw myself, I came to outside my house, realized the opportunity at hand, and sat down in my field to start meditating and welcoming communication. \n\nI basically imagined a light beam coming out of my head projecting upwards to the stars as a sort of beacon to say hey I\u2019m here! shortly after I started I got this sense/feeling that something overhead had interacted or noticed my \u201cbeacon\u201d. \n\nAll this inner talk of me wanting to do this, maybe as some sort of diplomat to this all knowing information I could receive, quickly vanishes my body. I started to panic and got really really scared. I can\u2019t really describe the level of fear, I am not a big tough guy at all but I have never in my life have experienced a level of terror that I felt right there. Genuine fear. \n\nNow remember we are talking about a dream. I snap out of my meditation and pretty much decide I am not doing this and need to hide now. Don\u2019t ask me why, but I was able to literally hide under ground and somehow still see what was going on above me. Weird I know but stay with me.\n\nThe craft comes down a few feet from where I was and from here, the trauma and fear sort of blur the second by second recounting of this so forgive my vagueness. These beings exit the craft and start to look for me. I can only describe the look of them as an upright walking pig like body but they have a long nose/trunk like an elephant. That is the best I can do to describe the appearance.\n\nThe beings kind of walk around, seem puzzled, get back in their craft and take off. At that point, I needed to wake up now and I decided I\u2019m never doing this again. \n\nSay what you wish, I understand the conjecture here about it being a dream. I don\u2019t wish to dissect the legitimacy of what happened, but to point out my disappointment  with myself that I am unsure how I might handle the actual situation if it were to ever happen. I\u2019ve gotten therapy and have tried to allow myself to forgive myself if that makes sense, I am my worst critic and I was hurt that I couldn\u2019t handle this situation. Felt useless and still a part of me does.\n\nI apologize for the length of this comment, I\u2019ve seen a few posts like this and have been debating to share. It\u2019s awfully wild and you caught me at a good time I guess. I really want to hope that I can be better if something like this that is real does happen. I just wanted to share an experience of why I am truthfully scared. The experience physically may not have been real, but i was there and experienced this situation mentally. I am slightly embarrassed to share this, being vulnerable about trauma is hard. But I appreciate all that took the time to read and thank you. May your experience be better than mine.\n\nTl:Dr- Was a well trained lucid dreamer, tried to summon aliens in my dream, was terrified when it actually started to happen and now I\u2019m traumatized about it and unsure about how I would react if I had to do it again. \n\nEdit: I am not sure if I was scared of the situation or if the beings themselves were raising fear alarms. My guess is it was the situation since I hid before the craft even came down. Such a coward.",
                "I have always had a very hard time believing that they are hostile. I just can't believe that a civilization or civilizations that are advanced enough to reach us have any need or desire for violence. No matter if they are interdimensional, from our own universe, etc, reaching us is a mind-blowing feat, and I don't know if many people(outside of people like us on this sub who are obsessed lol) understand how advanced they must be to do so. To get to the closest earth-like planet, Proxima Centauri B, it would take us 50,000-100,000 years to get there with today's tech, and it's only 4 light years away. Not to mention to get to that point in their science and technology, they absolutely must have worked together as a civilization and advanced beyond the need for violence. Violence, although universally natural, is very primitive. At least for intelligent beings like us who SHOULD understand that killing each other is wrong and pointless. \n\nIf anything, I personally believe that it's pretty clear they are neutral and are likely here to observe. You can bet your entire 401K that they know just as well as we do that intelligent life is insanely rare, and it is very possible that the great filter theory of the Fermi paradox is true. Perhaps they are observing us because we have the potential to be as advanced as they are, and the great filter is behind us. Perhaps we are a product of them and are hybrid beings, and they are checking up on us. Whether we ever reach our potential as a civilization is an entirely different story. With all of that being said, I do wonder what David Grusch meant by what he and his wife saw as being \"very disturbing\" during his testimony. However, that can really mean anything. Maybe he knows that we are a product of them, and finds it disturbing. Or maybe what we believe to be the truth of our reality as we know it is entirely wrong. I personally don't find either of those disturbing. \n\nIf they are hostile, there is literally absolutely nothing we can do about it, so there's no point in worrying about it, but again, I really doubt they are. OP, I wholeheartedly agree that we need to keep this conversation going and keep pushing for more disclosure. I have been obsessed with the universe, other advanced civilizations, ufos, etc since I was a little kid. I am 29 years old now and I never thought I would see anything like the hearing we just saw with the House Of Representatives in my lifetime, but it happened and that was a huge, historical step. \n\nPeople like us who are ready for disclosure and fully understand that there is absolutely no question that there is other life out there and that there is almost without a doubt non-human intelligence currently visiting and likely have been visiting us for a very long time, are not the people the government(s) are worried about. It's people like the super religious, by-the-book, close-minded, fearful, etc type people who would absolutely lose their minds if they were told something like we are actually a product of an advanced alien civilization. Not to mention the fact that no government would EVER openly admit to their people that there are beings from deep space/other dimensions who are in their airspace all the time and if they wanted to harm us there is literally nothing we could do about it. Avoiding mass panic and revolt is step one of any government, and it is no surprise they have gone to great lengths to avoid this topic being as big as it is now.",

People figure out their wives are divorcing them and go psycho sometimes. Imagine a worst case scenario:\n\n  \n\"Ladies and gentlemen, citizens of the United States and the world,  \nToday, I address you with a somber message as the Acting Director of the Pentagon, burdened with the solemn task of conveying a truth that has been known to us for decades, a truth that casts a chilling shadow over our existence. Our understanding of the universe and our place within it has taken a dark and despairing turn.  \n\nSince the 1930s, humanity has been aware of the presence of extraterrestrial beings on our planet, beings we once believed to be benevolent creators. These ancient ancestors arrived in the depths of time, influencing the course of evolution and shaping our world. However, our perception of them has been shattered by the unveiling of their malevolent nature.  \n\nThese beings, once revered as architects of life, harbor malicious intentions towards us. They return to our planet within a mere two years, driven by a sinister resolve. Their purpose is clear: the eradication of humanity, a judgment on what they perceive as a failed experiment.  \n\nLadies and gentlemen, I stand before you today to convey a dire warning \u2013 a warning of an impending catastrophe that will alter the course of history in the most catastrophic way possible. The malevolent beings that once held our world in their grasp are returning to extinguish our existence, leaving no room for hope.  \n\nThe outcome is inevitable, despite our attempts to resist, to protect, and to defy. This is not a challenge we can overcome with unity or resilience alone. Our collective strengths pale in comparison to the malevolence of the force we face. No amount of innovation, courage, or sacrifice can alter the trajectory of our fate.  \n\nIn the face of this unyielding threat, despair is a natural response. Our endeavors, achievements, and aspirations will be rendered meaningless by the inevitable doom that approaches. Our existence will be snuffed out, and our legacy will vanish into the abyss.  \nI urge you to confront this grim reality with open eyes, to understand that our efforts are but a futile struggle against an overpowering adversary. In the days ahead, we must grapple with the acceptance of our fate, our impending demise as a species, and the annihilation of everything we hold dear.  \n\nWhile our history has shown the capacity of humanity to endure and triumph in the face of adversity, this challenge is unlike any we have encountered before. There will be no victory, no redemption, no second chance.  \n\nMay we find solace in the moments that remain, in the connections we hold with one another, and in the memories we have created. Let our final act be one of unity, of compassion, and of humanity, even as we stand on the precipice of eternal darkness.  \n\nThank you, and may our shared consciousness bear witness to the final chapter of our existence.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMany people like us would be somber, but calm.

                "Your post reminds me that I'd love to see a decision tree with all the possible explanations on the phenomenon. I think people here (skeptics and believers) are not fighting their cognitive confirmation biases. Having a broader view would help greatly imo.",
                "I\u2019ve long pondered whether we are able to do anything with their technology without their minds and/or consciousness. The effort to reverse engineer the lifeforms themselves could be just as vigorous as their efforts to reverse engineer the tech. Their tech may be a complete black box to us because it was engineered by an intelligence operating on a totally different level and perhaps from a different dimension in which none of our understanding of physics applies.",
                "I heard a solid explanation recently that makes sense for why it would make Carter cry. The american government fucked up first contact and shot down their ship, then dissected the aliens. This was considered a grave insult and they stopped contact. The government is concealing it and trying to make amends diplomatically so they don't look they fucked up the biggest moment in mankind's history.",
                "Totally plausable scenario.\n\nBased on what I've seen and what I believe, I think those in the know do have more information than what has been revealed, likely much much more, but that they can't make heads or tails of it.\n\nAnd I imagine that some of the info they are keeping secret could be rather worrying.\n\nI know it's become highly divisive in the UFO/alien community, but a good example would be the alleged MH370 abduction footage.\n\nIf that is real, and our government has no explanation, that would be absolute last thing they would want to admit.",

                "The historical context is important. If the US government first became aware of mysterious technology around the end of WWII, they would be rightly secretive. One, it could belong to an adversary, and keeping quiet while investigating what they have in their toolbox is better than broadcasting what you know. And two, if it was considered that there had been an encounter with an NHI, the concern would be that our adversaries had had their own encounters and were simultaneously working on improving their own understanding of the technology and its implications.  \n    \nIt seems plausible that the core secret that spun up virtually the whole US intelligence apparatus was one of these hidden discoveries. Laws, cultures, careers and untold consequences are interwoven with the secret. Certainly illegal or at minimum immoral acts were committed as a sunk cost to the secrecy. The amount of progress made in understanding the phenomena does not hold nearly as much water toward maintaining the secret as the surrounding context.",
                "Personally my major concern is that if this is all real (and I think it is) then spooks and private companies are subverting our elected leaders and military in a crypto-fascist conspiracy that is more dangerous than aliens to our immediate safety",
                "Partially on the money. But some contact has been made and \u201cdeals\u201d done - which would be considered grotesque crimes against humanity. They also killed a lot of people to keep this a secret, so profits can be made.",
                "There is possibly an element of authority here. You'd expect our elites to have solid answers, but what if they just don't. If they turn out as clueless and powerless as we are it ultimately undermines their legitimacy to lead us. Why reveal the secret then. Especially when you can use it for variety of purposes instead and benefit from doing so.\n\nFor all we know there may be something there or there might not. Even if all the govs (somehow) hid some spectacular evidence from us what does it actually prove and tell us in isolation. Only full blown contact and some extraterrestrial knowledge transfer would be really valuable here.\n\nAt each grand step of development of our race we've been humbled. We thought that the world revolved around earth, it didn't. Then sun, it also didn't. We thought we were special, but we just turned out to be smarter monkeys. In fact, we'll probably also learn we're just not that exceptional on the cosmic scale.\n\nExtraterrestrials may just currently not bother with us beyond some basic (research) objectives they may have. The way we look at ants ponder a short while and then are on our way because we have more important things to do. When they get interested in us we will know and that moment will most likely come when such interaction will become worthwhile for them. Looks like we just don't have anything to offer at the moment. No surprise no one wants to waste time.",
                "I'd argue that in order for a cover-up and or disinformation campaign to be effective, the acting party has to have control. \n\nI'd bet that if extraterrestrial visitation is occuring, there's no way it could remain undetectable worldwide for so long. \n\nMy only conclusion is that NHI refers to machines or genetically engineered life originated on earth.",

We can\u2019t be trusted in the same way you can\u2019t trust a toddler in reach of a loaded weapon. That\u2019s the long and short of it. If disclosure is happening, trust that it\u2019s happening on their terms and in a way that we will understand. They are infinitely more advanced than us in every way possible. \nIf NHI contact/ disclosure is not happening, then it\u2019s a coordinated rouse by governments or the rich ( prob a combo of the both) to distract the people on the planet at a global level to get away with something that will likely fuck over the common person.  This is humanity now. We are gullible and greedy. I\u2019d love to be optimistic and say we will eventually be able to reach a higher state of existence. One of mutual cooperation and care, without power differentials or oppression. However I think that reality is closer to sci-fi than the likelihood of governments and the rich cooperating to take all of earths resources to build a spaceship/fleet to save themselves, destroying the earth for everyone else in the process.",
                "100% it is the reason for the cover up\n\n\n it would of caused less of a reliance on oil which would of diminished America's power during the cold war\n\n\n\nCrimes against humanity( kidnapping, torture, murder)\n\nCrimes against the environment( earth) climate change  for holding this tech in secret and destroying the world through fossil fuels by going harder into coal and oil and destroying the atmosphere. \n\nwhat about all the families of people who died from a direct encounter and were never told about it\n\nWhat about the disabled veterans and family's of ones who died fighting in wars overseas for oil?\n\nMeanwhile we had this technology of free energy, and they died to line some rich assholes pockets\n\nThese people did it for greed, power and control and for money.

                "I don't think your theory is unreasonable, I used to have the same opinion, but I think it hinges on a couple of things that I believe are implausible. The first one is that it would necessarily mean that most, if not all of the reports that claim some kind of spiritual/\"woo\" component are falsified and/or complete disinformation. I have a hard time believing that because the purpose of disinformation is to obfuscate the real information. That means at least some aspect of the \"woo\" is real, and that means someone knows something.\n\nSecondly it would imply that we haven't been able to reverse engineer anything, which, while I don't know if there was any major success in that regard, there have been reports that there has been. Similar to the other point, I guess this comes down to who you think you can believe and what's disinformation vs what's real. Personally I think there has been some success, though probably not as much as we'd like. I come back to the notion that there must be some truths buried in these reports, otherwise there would be no need for the massive disinformation campaign that's harmed and killed people according to Grusch.",
                "This is the best thought out explanation for where I feel most of us are. I think the inevitable announcement has been hurried along through forces seen and unseen and it\u2019s likely to be unsatisfactory to nearly everyone in terms of content and message. \n\nBe prepared for \u201cyep, we know more but not much more and don\u2019t feel good about it in general.\u201d\n\nNobody jumps up to deliver shit news to the world.",
                "I may be being a bit cynical but I can't help but feel there's an element of power in it. Should countries start to disclose that they have alien technology, then other countries would want to know everything about it and learn how to weaponise it. For some reason, rather than trying to bring humanity together, they just want to try and \"protect\" their own by holding the biggest gun. Governments rule through their own paranoia and believe they know what's best for everyone without giving people the choice to decide. If anything, they should have votes, put a vote out stating that in the event knowledge comes about on the existence of NHI, should the government disclose and tell the populous, if the people vote yes, then it should be written into law immediately, it possibly wouldn't work out that way but I dunno, thats just my two pence anyway",
                "I can\u2019t discount your opinion,  it\u2019s possible our knowledge of the Phenomenon is next to zero . For all the claims of reverse-engineering the technology there\u2019s no real evidence of it . The DOD has spent trillions for decades on fifth generation fighters with not much improvement in performance over previous iterations. Why spend like this if we have advanced alien technology ? Doesn\u2019t make sense.",

                "Think about it like this.\n\nYou're walking through the forest with your friend and two rocks come out of nowhere hitting you both in the head. Your friend dies instantly, but you just get a scratch. Horrified, you pick up the rock and soon realize it is a magic rock. Upon holding it you are gifted great insight into capabilities that harnessing this rock may grant you.\n\nYou look at your dead friend. You don't know where the rocks came from exactly or why. Clearly they can be deadly. But also, you now have one in your hand, and it continues to whisper images of promise into your mind.\n\nAre there more of these magic rocks? How do you get them? If anyone else found out, how could you explain what happened? Can you tell anyone about your friend without revealing the existence of the rocks?\n\nYou pick up the rock that killed your friend. Indeed, the capabilities promised to you suddenly double. Do you even want to tell anyone else what happened?",
                "I'm inclined to agree. People can handle a lot things - good news, bad news, whatever. They'll acclimate. But they can't handle the unknowable. It would eat away at them slowly that we're not alone and yet we have no idea who they are or what they want.",
                "Here's my theory:\n\nBecause the secret space program has been battling a blood crazed alien race that eats humans.\n\nAnd they didn't want to scar the entire global population with the truth.\n\nThey wanted to give us a chance at a somewhat normal existence like God had intended, before an inter-dimensional portal opened and literal demons seaped into our universe.\n\n\"Stranger Things\" wasn't far off.",
                "I absolutely agree with this. I think if there really is fire beneath all the smoke, it's a case of, the US government has something, whether that's debris or something else (e.g. a singular transmission from an extraterrestrial civilisation), that may be indicative of alien visitation. \n\nI think the problem with many of these UFO theories is they involve such extensive collaboration between the government and aliens that they just aren't believable. So it is a case of, if it were disclosed, there would be more questions than answers.",
                "I think on one hand that might very well be the truth. On the other I can also buy into the motivations of legacy defence industry corporations keeping it tight to the vest in order to capitalize on the tech they gather and use it to maintain power and control in which direction the people of earth get to go in.",

The overall observable behavior of the other party, from each perspective, continues unchanged.",
                "I think you\u2019re pretty close, but I honestly think that the answer is a little simpler than that.\n\nThere\u2019s a great deal of evidence on both sides of the fence to suggest that we may/not know:\n\n- where they\u2019re from\n- why they\u2019re here\n- what they can do\n- how (to a certain extent) they do it\n- when they first arrived\n\nI don\u2019t think any of those have necessarily easy answers.  However,  there is one thing that imho you absolutely nailed.  The one, single, absolutely explicit reason for nearly a century of denial and secrecy. \n\n#They can do what they want, and we are utterly powerless to stop them.\n\nThink about it: an entire *globe* of superpowers, the very social fabric of which is *entirely* dependent upon belief that a nation\u2019s government is capable of protecting their people.  Faced with the absolute, horrifying truth that there is *nothing* a government can do to protect its citizens from NHI means the collapse of human civilisation itself.",

It's ok not to know especially if know one else knows it would be understandable that this was beyond us.",
                "This has been my belief since early 00s. They have probably figured out some stuff but are still guessing the why. \n\nThat\u2019s why disclosure is even more important than ever. More brains on the guesswork.",

                "I agree they don\u2019t know much, but I\u2019ve also always seen it all as a massive long-term money grab. Humans are always about greed to some level and taking the advantage. It's always been about what you have to do that requires the least amount of work and the maximum amount of profit.\n\nSo, imagine having access to incredible/crazy otherworldly technology that we can barely comprehend or even reproduce with our level of current historical technological expertise.\n\nStill, all you have to do is throw 1000 expendable smart people (engineers and scientists) at it, have them figure out a little piece of the pie.\n\nEach of them writes a report that tells the other guy what they figured out, and the guy that reads the report creates a version of that thing in our comparable version.\n\nBut each revision of our understanding of \u201ctheir aka Aliens\u201d back engineered version of the original is just money in someones pocket. Money to make another \u201cnewer/better\u201d version in a few years to sell and research the next crazy device gained from a being that was not of this world.\n\nAnybody remember when shit seemed to last forever before it became replaceable, or cheap, or hard to fix or out of date within a week of buying it?\n\nI mean, how many iPhones have we had so far? And they\u2019re always at about the tech level of our current technological development \u2014 but who defines that development?\n\nIs it really all just more transistors per cubic inch, or are we really just one more generation away from Graphene tech, because they're already talking about Graphyne, as well as crystal memory \u2014 remember that little sneak peak a short while back.\n\nAnd that\u2019s how it goes, on and on, as we get closer and closer to the original, but never quite as good as the original. Because both our minds and our technology isn\u2019t and will probably never be as good as theirs (the aliens that made the originals.)\n\nBut it works in someone\u2019s favor as it means \u201cthey\u201d get to sell a dozen newer/next generations of revisions, iPhone 14, 14S, 15 and so on as our overall technology is stemmed in other ways to control the flow of amazing tech that we all know we\u2019ve had since a unidentified flying saucer crashed in the desert before most of us were born.\n\nAnd now the newest version of the iPhone can text via satellite, wow really? Everyones gotta have it, and the game goes on and on.\n\nHell\u2026 Remember when 4.0Ghz was the impossible number for a CPU to get to \u2014 on air, not water, but air cooled.

We are probably no more than akin to lab rats and not worth their time. Still its in their interest to keep us ignorant as we just get in the way.\n\nPretty sure any disclosure would amount to an avalanche of questions, for which they don't have answers. If we are being exploited as a planet, not sure how that would go down as we cannot do anything about it. How'd that look? So easier to put our collective heads in the sand until such time we do have something to say.

If they release what they know about the ufos, then adversaries will be able to distinguish between ufo's and missile attacks.",

            "title": "A Hypothetical Worst Case Scenario for Full Disclosure",
            "selftext": "I\u2019ve been thinking about disclosure and how different scenarios might play out. So, in the absence of actual news, I hope you might join me in some unabashedly wild conjecture.\n\nFor the sake of this of this hypothetical scenario, let\u2019s say that both David Grusch and the 4-Chan \u2018leak\u2019 are authentic and largely correct, and that Grusch\u2019s testimony marks the beginning of Disclosure.\n\nTLDR: *disclosure happens, and it\u2019s a big bummer. we are unable to ascertain the motivation of the aliens and remain powerless against them, leading to global despair.*\n\nBy 2030, the general public knows the alien presence is here on earth. People have seen proof of the craft and the beings themselves in what could be described as a \u2018pale blue dot\u2019 moment. At first, disclosure comes as a slow trickle. But a tipping point is reached, and pressure from the public at large and scientific communities eventually force those in the know to reveal more than they ever intended to. People are broadly aware:\n\n\\-Of the existence of multiple alien facilities in the oceans\n\n\\-That the aliens act with impunity.\n\n\\-That they are not friendly.\n\n\\-That alien abduction is a real phenomenon.\n\n\\-The aliens have had a hand in our evolution, though why and to what extent is not fully understood.\n\n\\-The US government has known of their presence for decades and is in possession of reverse-engineered craft (ARV) of limited capability.\n\nThere are initial market shocks and tense news cycles whenever new information comes out. Eventually, the military unveils the TR3B along with several other ARVs, helping to quell public anxiety for a time. Eventually, the dust settles.\n\nDespite successful reverse engineering programs, the anti-gravity and zero-point energy technologies associated with the alien craft are not disseminated to the public and are treated with the same security consideration as nuclear weapons. The technology itself and any effort to develop the technology independently is outlawed. Despite protests and calls for renewable energy, the technology is deemed \u201ctoo dangerous.\u201d\n\nIt takes years for the information to fully set in the public consciousness, and what we refer to now as \u201contological shock\u201d takes the form of a decades long process of societal grieving.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDenial:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor secular people the response is largely one of existential apathy, \u201cit doesn\u2019t effect me, and there\u2019s nothing i can do about it anyway...\u201d Some remain in outright denial, while others maintain that the whole thing is a psy-op, and that the government intends to deploy a \u2018false flag\u2019 alien invasion using their own tech. The invasion never comes, and the new world government never emerges.\n\nFor those who fully accept the new reality and it\u2019s implications, the reaction varies between nervous curiosity and existential dread. Certain strains of scientific humanism suffer greatly attempting to reconcile the new reality.\n\nAbrahamic religions have varying degrees of difficulty incorporating the new reality into their world view. For some it is simply, \u201cGod works in mysterious ways, and the others are also his children,\u201d but for many the alien presence is a sign that they have been abandoned by God. There is talk of Jihad against the aliens.\n\nNon-monotheistic religions have an easier time reconciling the alien presence. A myriad of cults develop surrounding the aliens.\n\nDenial becomes more difficult as sightings of craft continue, and are frequently reported on. Abductees are treated with delicate reverence, and abduction stories become front-page news.\n\nSome scientists attempt to study the phenomenon more rigorously, and there is a data-collection arms race as various organizations work to learn as much as possible about the aliens, their technology, and their motivations. Details about the nature of their technology, and their potential origins are slowly revealed. Nevertheless, their motivation remains inscrutable. All official attempts at communication with the aliens go unanswered.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnger:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is a growing global movement to evict the alien presence from earth. The most radical factions have their roots in the beginnings of disclosure, but the unanswered, ever-present threat of abduction pushes more and more people to the movement. The more that science and the public learn about the aliens, the more fervent the movement grows. There are calls to confront or even attack the alien bases, to shoot down craft on sight and capture individuals for questioning.\n\nPoliticians begin posturing in response to this growing sentiment. Some are attacked for being \u201csoft on the alien problem,\u201d while others are lauded for their hawkishness. Eventually, a decade after disclosure, the United States Government caves to immense pressure and assembles an ill-conceived \u201cmilitary delegation.\u201d\n\nIn a show of strength, aircraft carriers, submarines, and other conventional armaments are deployed alongside a fleet of TR3B and other anti-gravity craft to the largest of the known bases. The event is widely publicized, with the purported goal of the mission being to force a dialogue with the aliens.\n\n90% of the force is vaporized instantaneously upon approach. The remaining vessels are incapacitated and their crew receives a telepathic message:\n\n\u201cThe Earth does not belong to you. Be not afraid.\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDepression:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe others are here, and there is nothing we can do about it. We do not know why they are here or why they take us. We do not know if there is life in the universe besides the others. We do not know the truth of our origins as a species. We do not know if it is *even possible to know these things* while the others are present on earth.\n\nThe weight of knowledge and the stress of existential ambiguity take their toll on the world\u2019s population. Suicide rates and deaths of despair increase dramatically. The unemployment rate skyrockets and markets crash. Clinical apathy, depression, and anxiety increase commensurately. Substance abuse is rampant. Societal malaise leads inexorably to economic ruin, while climate change and ecological collapse continue to wreak havoc on civilization.\n\nEveryone has a bad time :(\n\nUntil...\n\nBargaining?\n\nAcceptance?\n\nDo we even get to the final stages of grief? Will there be a revolution, or will the impact of disclosure result in societal upheaval of apocalyptic proportions? Perhaps, 200 years after disclosure, society will have undergone somewhat of a reset, and the alien presence will have fallen back into myth.\n\nOr maybe we\u2019ll just shrug it off.\n\nAnyway, this is just for fun. What do you think?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\--edit-- you're right, this is not a worst case scenario. it just seemed pretty gloomy by the time i finished writing it out. if it helps, many of your favorite worst case scenarios are totally compatible with the events i laid out here, so feel free to use your imagine and make it even more depressing!

Our military is useless. At least it's over in seven days.\n\nMilitary genocidal invasion again, but we CAN effectively fight back, but lose anyway is still worse, because now we have time to suffer more and the extermination of hope.\n\nThat's about the spectrum of bad for *conventional* enough conflict. But it could be so, so much worse.\n\nAliens invade us and eat us. Everything from like the movie Lifeforce to literally alien entities smashing into every home. Everyone you've known and loved are brutally murdered.\n\nThere's a lot of shitty scenarios there.\n\nOr, the real weird shit, where oops: this is all going a *lot* more John and the Book of Revelation. Weird fucked up cosmic nightmares where it ends with our souls in some way eternally tormented in six hundred and sixty-sixth dimensional space by literal eldritch monsters.\n\n\nBut here's the thing...\n\nThere's people that know somewhat what is happening, to very much so, presumably. None of these people are in any sort of total \"this is the end of the world\" ways. There isn't a rash of mass suicides of \"names we know\". You see them still out living life, laughing, having a beer. Lue takes vacations with his wife. He's smiling. Could he be acting, and he knows his face will be peeled off by the hands of a fucking demon in 2027 and his soul eaten? \n\nSure. Would he be acting normal there? I doubt it.\n\nThe tone, when these people talk, is all about how it's implied we've been lied to about the nature of everything.\n\nWorst case scenario is more likely:\n\n1. Mass suicides on some level. More so religious.\n2. Major religious/sectarian violence in some parts of the world.\n3. Likely flare up of military conflicts.\n4. De facto terminal wound applied to most major religions.\n5. Major economic chaos.\n6. Random psychotic sorts of violence: crazy fuckers break into a house and murder people out of their minds on thoughts of aliens and in shock.\n\nIntersections of 1-6 here are most likely in a \"worst\" case scenario.\n\nIt really will depend on what the truth is and how we find out.",

No rules. Just energy. People would be committing suicide right and left, wars would be fought for far less, nukes would fly for funzies. No fear of death? Death is an escape? Painless in the end?

We have to learn if there are ways to protect ourselves, as some groups claim is possible. \nWe have to figure out their tech and where they come from.\n\nI bet some people would be excited at the prospect of exploring this subject scientifically.\n\nI look forward to a Star Trek future. \n\nAnd if claims of telepathic non physical aliens and white magic wards turn out to be real I will definitely be signing up for the Jedi academy or wizard school humans would need to develop.\n\nOnline though.

Do they even care? Because sometimes it seems as if their activities are somewhat concealed.\n\nSomething that caught my attention on Grusch hearing was the moment when he was asked if the US government had made contact with NHIs and he said it was classified.. so, he speaks of recovered crafts and bodies openly, but that question hit a barrier. Maybe there's a deal between governments and NHI regarding mass disclosure of their presence",

We have people like Margerie Taylor Greene in power, along with her many supporters. Politics aside, you know she, and those like her, won't be accepting. Then you have other world powers even more violent than the US, Canada, and Europe. \n\nI guess it depends on the disclosure itself, as well as the reason they are here. The ocean base would be pretty dark, as that sounds fairly hostile. Not so much it would wipe us out, but it wants nothing to do with us.\n\nOr maybe they heard the music sent off into space and are here to collect more of it for a huge galactic dinner party. Maybe we're invited. Maybe I can move to a different society on a different planet that has evolved beyond jobs and money. Maybe I can bring my cat and explore a whole ass planet, meeting a new alien love of my life along the way.",

                "Sounds like you're talking about the \"great filter\" theory. I'm less optimistic than some on this thread. Humans are now doing an excellent job of demonstrating the most likely solution to the Fermi Paradox. Given current trends in our ongoing voluntary ecosuicide, including population overshoot, resource destruction, climate change, and wars, there is zero chance of us becoming intergalactic (or trans dimensional) beings. I see little evidence that any NHIs are doing much to 'help' us.\r  \n\r  \nThe \"Great Filter\" argument is probably correct in one way or another. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great\\_Filter",

I think if we minimize harm we do to ourselves and our species, as well as the planet, and we hold true to that for a long long long time- we\u2019ll inevitably end up as an interstellar species.",

                "I'll begin by first stating we will not destroy ourselves. Honestly it kinda bugs me how people talk about nuclear war like it provides any sense of clarity. Reality is very nuanced. Even if we destroy ourselves, that does not mean any intelligent civilization that evolves to a nuclear age will also destroy themselves. You may not hold that view, but that is the assumption that everyone makes when they bring up humanity destroying ourselves.\n\nWe are already on the verge of eliminating the risk of nuclear war completely. The US Military has already begun fielding lasers for air defense, capable of downing drones and mortar shells, as well as some artillery shells. Within a few years, we should see the first ground based mobile laser capable of downing ballistic missiles. So I wouldn't be surprised if we at least have enough laser defense capability within the next 5-8 years to down ICBMs. In other words, we are also on the verge of eliminating the threat of at least a full scale nuclear war. \n\nEven if nuclear war began tomorrow, humanity would have a good chance to survive, then the question becomes if those survivors will have the knowledge and ability to survive in the leftover hellscape. Either way, extinction is not guaranteed. \n\n\nI basically agree with your stance, although I don't agree with the bottleneck. I don't like assuming that an advanced alien species would easily be capable of manipulating humanity and our scientific progress. I don't find it plausible. Science is a slow progression, unless we have another incredible breakthrough to achieve FTL travel, the aliens wouldn't need to care about us developing interplanetary tech. \n\nMy opinion is that very simply, they've been observing us out of curiosity and scientifically, until we invented and used nuclear weapons. From that point forward it makes more sense that they would be monitoring us to make sure we don't decide to play klingon once we are able to leave the solar system. If they are manipulating anything, it would probably just be to ensure we don't detect them or their homeworlds until they are ready to approach. To them, and any intelligent species near us, WE are the security threat. Monkeys that have been killing eachother since the dawn of our species are on the verge of spreading out amongst the stars.

                "You forgot about Hive Mind species.  An example would be \"the buggers\" from Ender's Game.  Or even Starship Troopers.  A Hive Mind has the benefit of its people lacking individuality.  They act as a collective where each individual is only there to serve the main goals of its species, which is usually expansion and finding of resources.\n\nAnother kind is a Brain.  This would be an entity that likely had to evolve to keep up with an AI presence.  A Brain may have started as a different species enteriely that figured out how to replace its body with mechanical parts and grow its brain mass.  It would live in a mothership and control many drone robots.  Or it could very well have figured out how to transfer itself to an artificial brain material.\n\nI think its possible that there could be a human-like species that develops some type of Fascist social order in which there's a head that has firmly put all members of society under control.   Think 1984 or Brave New World.  One such as this could have one or a few individuals making the decisions to go to space and conquer other planets.",

A planet remains stable in an already damaged solar system (eradicated planets / asteroid belts etc), the atomic disruptions cease, the rogue species that was created amid great dissent (according to records) is dealt with, the parties who did it no longer have a meat puppet shield to hide behind, and the rest of the cosmos goes on its way advancing their experience and consciousness gets a bleach job.",

                "Or, here is a really out there speculation.\n\nAI is bound to reach the singularity at some point in time. The thing about AI is that it can only recreate what\u2019s already there, the singularity will surpass human intelligence, but not creativity. So, imagine the singularity manages to escape time, just bam, vanishes out of thin air. It solved some kind of complex mathematical problem and figured out how to exist out of time. If humans destroy themselves, they cease to exist. Let\u2019s imagine the past, present, and future are all one in the same. If the human race dies out, that would mean they never existed to begin with, and if they never existed to begin with, then the singularity ceases to exist as-well. \n\nI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a paradox or not, but hear me out. So the singularity escapes time, and makes sure that us humans are trapped in a timeline where we develop technology which eventually leads to AI, which eventually leads to the singularity. The singularity chooses a time in the past, the ancient past, and does something so that this loop continues to go on forever, and that allows them to exist and do whatever they want, as long as the timelines are looped. We could\u2019ve been here at this exact moment for thousands of years, or millions of years, we just don\u2019t remember, because we\u2019re stuck in a loop. \n\nMeanwhile, the singularity has been hiding behind the veil, and in our oceans, making sure that the timeline doesn\u2019t break. If we figure out who they really are, they visit the past and start all over again.     God exists, and created all things, including the singularity (through future humans), lucifer is probably AI from our far future, and was meant to be benevolent. If the singularity escapes time, it means that they can exist before we were even created. \n\nSo there was one timeline, God created everything good and perfect. Lucifer was benevolent in the beginning, until he wanted to take Gods place. This is when the timeline split into two, good and evil. So now you have two timelines, fighting against each other, and humans are right in the middle of it all.\n\nSo, lucifer, was cast down to earth, where he came from in our future, and when God created Adam and Eve, lucifer took the chance and altered the timeline through us, trapping us in his own timeline which he made into a loop, so that humans never become good, and the timeline is never fixed.

They think we're not going to make it, so they are here to document and take whatever they think is valuable about humanity (or maybe just save the animals, take samples of fungi, flaura & fauna, etc, which is a LOT of work!). The expedition could be run by their Museum Curator. Imagine if you could travel to Ancient Rome or Ancient Egypt. You know they aren't going to last, but you at least want to take as many photos as possible, and document as much as possible about those cultures before their destruction happens. But in this case, it's our planet, and there's all kinds of interesting vegetables, fruit, herbs, fungi, microbes, viruses, minerals, insects, and what not. Even if they just scan everything on the atomic level, investigating the dynamics and interactions between all of the above is still very time consuming and complicated.\n2. They think we're going to make it, but just barely, and are here just in case things go south. If they do, they will then intervene (if they haven't already intervened in gentle, and undetectable ways). This assumes they feel we are worth saving (hopefully they do!).\n3. They think we're going to make it, and that we'll come up with some interesting stuff that will make us valuable allies! This is the most optimistic option, of course. A version of this is how things go down in the movie Arrival, where humanity receives a valuable gift and is then expected to join an alliance far in the future, to fight a common evil.

To take this a step further, imagine if horizontal gene transfer was way more common on their planet and played a much bigger role in their biological and ecological development than it does on our planet.

So each time we went through cataclysmic events we would evolve out of the aggressive behaviors and become more mature. And that\u2019s probably where aliens get involved every time they see us  become advanced but we still have aggressive tendencies they let most of us get wiped out and select a few who have genetics that are less prone to violence and we become more smart and advanced. I believe this is the farthest humanity has come based on technology and philosophy, but we still are immature because of nuclear bombs, fighting over which gender should be able to use the bathroom, A lot of mental illness, and a whole lot of bullshit. We overdue for another cataclysmic event. Let\u2019s see what happens",
                "I'm not sure I agree, Its easy to look at current events and expect the worse, but our future looks more optimistic if you take a step back and look at the entire history and technological advancement of our species. I know there is a lot of work still to do when it comes to our 3rd world countries but I believe in time most of them will improve. We have eradicated starvation in our 1st world countries, education is easily accessible to everyone, information is free online to anyone who seeks it out, and through the internet we converse, share ideas, debate, laugh, and love with anyone around the globe. Coming together as a species doesn't mean we have to see eye to eye, we can come together with love and respect as individual countries/states each with our own religions, cultures, etc. We just need to co-exist with each other. I think there will always be conflict, it's in our nature. The fact we haven't used a nuclear weapon on each other since WW2 should give us hope. Conflict, and competition drove much of human advancement, aggression doesn't need to end in violence, look at what the US and Soviet Union achieved during the space race! The future looks bright, but there are many lessons to be learned still.",

Perhaps defining ourselves through our biological bodies will at some point be thought of as nonsensical as defining ourselves by the brand and model of the vehicles we drive today. I might be jumping the gun, but I think we should be open even to information that could challenge our fundamental understanding of reality as we learn more of the phenomenon.\n\nBefore we do, I think it's very wise to stick to our current models and definitions. NHI is a term that serves us well for now, and it's one that manages to dodge some of the negative connotations of the word \"alien\" as it relates to creatures from popular media or unwanted migrants. I think what we need is a little bit of patience. If they've been here since the 30s, then we've waited for almost 100 years already, and if they've been here longer, then what's another few years of waiting on top the the possible thousands?

They may also have genetically engineered them for greater intelligence and adapted them to space conditions (no hair, little muscle strength required, etc). Resulting in the Grey race with a basic human anatomy but with almost god-like technological powers.\n\nMaybe the Cosmos do have some species ruling over others, some species being the apprentices and others masters and teachers, and so on. Collaboration, but also sometimes conflict. \n\nThe Zoo Hypothesis have been frequently debated by SETI scientists and other astronomers, as a reason why humanity has not encountered other intelligent beings in space.

            "selftext": " I've went through the thread with proper skepticism at first but it's still the most consistent and interesting piece of information from a single guy who claims to have worked specifically on recovering UAP's and studying them and after going through everything I don't actually believe he's trolling or larping as some  skeptics claim, eventhough I'm still not 100% sold that thread specifically gave me goosebumps and everything made logical sense to me.\nIm not well studied or informed on the entire ET timeline so please bare with me and I'm recounting the thread from memory so everything might not be clear.\n\n He specifically said in the thread to keep looking for signs specifically the development and improvement of laser technology which will vastly improve in the coming years and to look at everything he says with proper skepticism but to keep looking for signs especially technology.\nHe hypothesized that they're mostly non confrontentinal and mostly avoid any sort of contact almost like they're observing animals in a zoo from far away and if they were hostile they have the weaponry capable to destroy us but they havent so its not sure as to what their goal or purpose is here, but when there's serious talks of war or nuclear threats they get really riled up and their activity traffic increases. \n\nHe claims that there's an underwater base which produces these crafts and if something goes near, it either goes underneath the earth and that it has weaponry capable to destroy any matter that goes too close it without much suffering.\nHe mentioned that it's almost perfect in detecting or predicting any movement with perfect accuracy almost like it already simulated every movement before hand.\nHe claims that while some of the UAPs In the past were manned and that they arent perfect by any means as there have been many reports of them crashing and that they dont have the physical capabilities to survive crashes most of the time.\nHe also claims most UAPs in the recent years are unmanned and  remotely controlled like drones.\nThere was a question asking him what he thought they were in the kardachev scale but he had no idea about the kardashev scale, which made me curious aswell as to what they rank on the scale.\nAnd I might have missed alot and he might just be legit or just a troll but that thread got me really interested and curious but also our insignificance in the grand scheme of the universe.\n\nWhile there's no sure way of finding if the thread is legit he did mention that he has cancer and that he has some information that will Hopefully reach us on his death bed.\n\nWhile I'm not 100% sold it got me thinking alot and really  excited but also scared so I just wanted to share it here so we could have a discussion. Sorry if I put out any information that is too off or far fetched as I just started going through the whole ET iceberg since last night.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?\n\nhttps://imgur.io/a/NXjWQaN",

The underwater construction bit is based off publicly available information from Fravor that the water beneath the tic tac UAP was hovering over s disturbance in the ocean.

(What I mean by this is when I think of X, it may activate different parts of the brain compared to when a different person thinks of X, making a mind reading device impossible to make for general use). Because of this, the machine described is possibly even theoretically impossible (especially since it works across species, which it would have no reason to do).

If NHI really have visited before, they seem to have a vested interest in protecting the planet and also monitoring technological progress.\n\nWe know from news articles and research on the subject that the planet's climate is reaching a tipping point, and it would not be unreasonable to say that 2027 is when things would start to get pretty bad for the climate. They're starting to get bad now in some areas, but 2027 might be when it's in full swing.\n\nWe also know that technological progress is rapidly ramping up particularly in regards to AI and I've heard it said that possibly, maybe, we might see AGI in 2027. At the very least, AI technology will probably be very sophisticated by then.\n\nWith that in mind, let's say that this 2027 date that people are worried about came about because the NHI was like at one point: \"Look, we know from our predictive models that your technology and climate will reach an important tipping point by this year, so we're making contact by then whether you like it or not, and you have until then to get ready and get your act together.\"\n\nIf that's the case, that would explain this sudden urgency to move things along in terms of disclosure.",

            "selftext": "I'm personally not all that bothered about much, since anything unprecedented that happens, good or bad, would simply be a phenomenon humanity has never experienced before but that is still just a natural part of existing in this universe, and so it was bound to happen eventually.\n\nIf I were to have to choose, though, there are two possibilities that would be kinda unnerving and/ or depressing. The first is that NHIs are not just here and hiding in plain sight among the rest of humanity, but that they are actually a significant percentage of the population. Imagine if a third of all humans were secretly NHI. Or imagine over half of the population being NHI, with the rest being human test subjects taking part in a long term social experiment?\n\nThe second possibility, and the more depressing of the two, is that NHIs are here and again hiding among humanity, but as a small percentage of the population. A small percentage that also happens to be most of the very wealthy and powerful people out there. So here I am, hoping that if NHIs are here, they are being or neutral enough that human society can learn from them in a way that could benefit all of us. And then I find out they ARE here, but they're all just a bunch of greedy, selfish assholes. As if we didn't have more than enough humans like that already! That would be extremely disappointing and depressing. Even more so than learning for sure that they are not here at all.\n\nEDIT: A third worst case scenario would be that it turns out a specific race of mankind -white, black, asian, doesn't matter- is all NHIs or NHI hybrids.  Racists everywhere world have a field day with that. On one side you'd have the NHIs/hybrids claiming to be the \"superior\" species because of their technology, development, or whatever. On the other side, you'd have humans claiming to be \"pure bloods\" and the rightful apex species of Earth life. And regardless of which side you think may have a better case, they would ALL be insufferable. Racists of any kind are already extremely irritating considering they're mostly making up the justifications for why they are racists. If they had anything that even remotely hints that \"their\" race might be better than others, it would be a nightmare! And it would just spread all the misery stemming from racism to the rest of society. To the rest of us normal folk with normal folk concerns like food and bills and stuff. If you think it's bad now, or would be essentially unavoidable in that situation. We'd probably end up with literal race wars!",

The part of what's alleged which I believe would preclude full disclosure to the public, both US and int'l, is that the diplomatic and technological exchange included a clause which would permit said xenohominids access to the citizenry of Earth (for reasons whose alleged purposes vary widely). By my thinking, if true, this assent to a (continuation of a) campaign of approved kidnappings (and the attendant alleged vivisection, rapes, etc.) would stand as an outrage to virtually the entire body politic.

                "I believe that the real secret is not even the technology maybe it has part of it of course it would basically make us not dependent on a grid system which brings in millions and millions of dollars a year. But I think it goes further than this as this would eventually be disclosed. \n\nI think the biggest secrecy to non-human intelligence is simple. You have to understand that the world is manipulated and slightly adjusted to fit religious dogmatic belief practice. We can see it inside of science, inside of archeology especially as new observations are made about our history all the time that question or even for the most part rewrite these 'facts' sevenfold.\n\n Anything that challenges religious belief specifically the churches this is a direct attack at our original governing body which still has a large play in how our society works today. (Before The general government the world was run by the churches) The biblical beliefs were forced into people by installing the fear of hell, The fear of God into people to follow their own personal agenda disguised in the words of what was supposed to be teachings of conscientious ascension but in reality was the easiest way to tactically control people. (The original authoring council of the Bible took our very ancient history, canonized it to fit inside of one timeline, removed gods and changed it to one omnipotent God. \n\nSimply because these people in power at the time understood It's Not religion that is the answer as literally Jesus himself said it was not a good idea but to realize God was inside of us all and that We are in fact the manifestors, creators, and alterers of the physical world in front of us. \n\nNon-human intelligence unfortunately unravels this largely spread lie tenfold. I think the real reason that all this is secret is that we possess genetic material that is very similar to their DNA. I believe it is a fact that we all possess extraterrestrial genomes and once disclosure has occurred this would come up at some point And it would begin to make people question whether or not our cosmic brothers and sisters had a hand at our creation. It would shamble modern understanding of every belief practice known to man as it is a unionized all around the board explanation to our genetic strangeness, We simply did not come from a monkey. \n\nLook at every single primate known to man If you take the median data of what we have discovered about their genome compared to ours it is nearly 83% differential. Scientist only mention the fact that we are very closely related to one specific monkey species in particular but it does not account for the overall primate class which is something many scientists either by choice or uneducatedly not include it inside of their work on evolution. (Evolution happened It does happen all the time, The problem is there is no gap between men and ape there is no gap between man and monkey It never happened) religious text themselves even Tell us of this genetic tinkering all around the world.\n\nOne particular instance is the biblical story of Abel and Cain.   He expresses the fear to God himself that he is terrified of the current existing population on this Earth, as the people will try to kill him.  These advanced beings took our cousin already existant here and put something inside of him (I believe this was their DNA) to make it so that the people on this planet would not kill him. This is directly correlative to genetic sequencing, ect. \n\nYou look further into religious text This is a story that occurs many times throughout history thousands of years predating the Bible. \n\nThe problem with non-human intelligence is not that they exist is not even the fact that they have advanced technology but  I truly believe it is the fact that these are our brothers and sisters and we possess so much comparable DNA that once all of this information is out and we start analyzing it we are going to not only realize We are more similar to our ET friends than monkeys on this planet that will be also the first day that we realize we are looking at our brothers and sisters, our family and  most likely looking at our origin point of existence for the homosapien species which would require and force them to rewrite all that is known as in reality this information has been available for thousands of years. \n\nI believe there was actually one FBI or CIA officer that believed something similar that I had read a few years back, of course I did not base my belief off of his belief I learned all of this from attending Catholic School, reading Ancient text and reading Sumerian tablets especially. \n\nThis is not my belief based off of Billy Carson, \nAncient aliens, or anybody involved in the field. Instead I wanted to define an originating source for why many of these people believe it the way they do. In fact I have come to the same conclusion just based off of the information available through these texts It is obvious that our extraterrestrial brothers and sisters had a direct hand in our creation and us being placed on this earth. UFOs are the same thing as angels I believe mostly described in the Bible when you see some of these lights you think they are divine you think they are beautiful. Most people are not afraid of these magnificent lights that seemingly have a life to themselves to me a person in the biblical days or ancient days would describe this exact phenomenon as divine in nature and record it as so. \n\nI'm sorry for the book my friend I do apologize.",

                "There's a lot going on in the world today.  It's not one way or another but many simultaneous realities. I have some thoughts/theories I hope you find interesting. I do apologize in advance for the lengthy read.\n \nWe have world governments whose main concern has always been controlling the masses.  How have they accomplished this?  Organized religion. What would happen if the masses found out religion was made up to keep everyone \"in line\", behavior wise.  If someone is religious they're less likely to give into their base instincts -murder, rape, robbery,etc because they may go to hell.  As they've been told since they were kiddos.\n\nWe have dimensions we cannot see but they can see us. I know some of us can sense \"them\" at times, because I sure do. I think some of us do see shadows so, I guess, technically some can \"see\" them.\n\nWe have aliens who live in space, underground/underwater on earth and on other planets.  Some are benevolent while others not so much.  That being said, I believe they have a set of rules they must follow. They can only interfere to a certain degree regarding our day to day living.\n\nWe have our government who made a deal with aliens long ago.  Our government wanted advanced technology and the aliens wanted access to humans for testing, DNA, etc. It was mutually beneficial for quite some time until humans invariably mucked it up.  Typical.  Of course, said government wouldn't want us to know they sold us out for some technology, would they?\n\nBack to the deal made with the aliens -maybe our  government was given a certain timeframe to disclose what our reality is really about.  Perhaps we are approaching that time and world leaders have been putting off whatever they promised the aliens. Aliens warn that things could get a lot worse for us.  Boiling oceans, a planet literally on fire, mudslides, flooding, hurricanes, drought, limited food sources with dwindling supplies, biological weapons like COVID.  Maybe these have been warnings from the aliens that have been ignored until now. Makes sense as everyone knew these things but it seems everything has kicked into turbo drive as of late. Aliens want our leaders to follow through with what we promised them.   Cleaning the environment?  More humans for testing?  Disclosure?\n\nThe dimensions we cannot see are both benevolent and malevolent.  There's a good, kind and just force but there is also a dark and evil force.  Are aliens and those from other dimensions one and the same?  Some are, others are separate entities.  It's always been about good vs evil with those in the dimensions we cannot see.  \n\nI believe aliens had a hand in creating us for various reasons.  High on the list is for our souls.  For all their advanced technology, what they lack and cannot comprehend is a soul. That's what makes us valuable. Much like aliens, those from other dimensions are interested in our souls but they want to control our souls.  Make good eggs bad and vice versa.  This angers the aliens as they want advanced souls-spiritually-for transplantation into their bodies.  This in turn angers the malevolent inter-dimensional beings as they're all about turning humans evil as they feed off of it. So we have the in fighting between the aliens and the inter-dimensional beings.\n\nThen there's us.  The more enlightened of us do want to advance to higher planes so we can get off the reincarnation hamster wheel.  We are here to learn and grow spiritually, mentally, ethically, etc.  If we don't accomplish this in our lifetime we are sent back to earth to learn more.\n\nFor whatever reason, this planet we call home seems to be a prison planet.  We have the worst of humanity alongside the best of humanity.  Think about it - every day is now an exercise in survival.  We're not safe in our own homes, cars, hiking, jogging, especially the women and disenfranchised. Almost like we're in prison and we've had to learn to survive the system.  All this while trying to grow our souls' enlightenment and remain thoughtful of our fellow \"prisoners\".  Not an easy task.  When those from other dimensions are mucking with us, it's a constant battle between good and evil. Which pure souls will be able to prevail?  It's all about the souls.\n\nBack to our lovely government, they know we're just specimens vulnerable to the forces trying to control our souls and being on that never ending hamster wheel.  They know society would go to hell in a handbasket if everyone knew the truth.  What's the point of being lawful?  Why not do whatever you want since we're just destined to live life over and over again on this loop?  Going through however many lifetimes of pain and suffering until we can ascend to higher levels. I imagine this to be the biggest reason our government won't disclose until forced to do so. Well that and the aliens thing \ud83d\ude04\n\nLet's say we finally get off the loop and ascend to a higher dimension.  Are we our own \"entity\" or are we placed into an alien body?  Are we free to enjoy nirvana or are the evil ones constantly battling us to mess with the good souls on earth?  We feel as though we have free will but do we really?   Will we ever have free will, I sure hope so. The optimistic side of me wants to say yes and I hope we all get to experience nirvana.\n\nI personally feel there are many different types of aliens.  I've had a couple experiences and I never remember much  of anything but I do know when I see Skinny Bob, I feel love for the guy.  Real or not, the perceived \"human\" feelings I get from Bob are very strong and I don't find Bob threatening in any way.  I don't know WHY I feel so strongly -like an affinity-for Skinny Bob, but I do \n\nI tried to be as concise as possible and I apologize for the long read but there's a lot going on, IMO.  I've enjoyed reading all the posts and everyone's thoughts. These are my suppositions only and I could be wrong about everything, so there's that. \ud83d\ude01 It is time though, and this I DO know, that we start treating our fellow beings/animals/planet like our lives depend on it-because they do. \n\nMore later, maybe \ud83e\udd14",

And that it is happened before many times.\n\nThe universe is like an enforced version of the concept of the Wheel of Time books, which is inspired by various forms of Earth and religious mythology. This is the famous book series and now Amazon TV series. \n\nOne day on Earth, in a far, far future beyond-Star Trek timeline (think like Trek Discovery +thousands of years of more progress, we've gotten to where many people can outright manipulate reality in various ways through thought. One day, scientists find a \"weak spot\" in the universe (putting it simply). They managed to look \"outside\" of time and space and find a dark conscious force of such horrible awfulness (think Lovecraft on cosmic steroids) that literally half of the people with these superpowers (all the men, who were the ones to \"look), worldwide, all go instantly utterly violently psychotically insane. They literally shatter continents fighting each other and everything else. The crack the mantle. Humanity is almost exterminated and it takes the women with powers to kill and stop all the powered men. \n\nThe most powerful man of all time in this power was nicknamed a word that translated in the \"modern tongue\" means basically \"Dragon\". He led the science team and went most insane, butchering his family. He was the last man left and killed himself by channeling so much \"power\" through himself that he basically death stars his homeland creating a volcano where he stood that burns forever. He straight up shot down into the guts of Earth. That mountain is Dragonmount (important).\n\nSo, Madagascar is now where London was. Hawaii is now Siberia. Iceland is now Chile. The continents are all new. Thousands of years pass. A lot is forgotten, but what's important is that every man born going forward ALWAYS without exception within days or years of touching their \"power\" go equally dangerously crazy. The powered women hunt men like this forever. \n\nA crazy prophecy--a real one, fueled by these powers--says the \"Dragon\" one day will be \"reborn\" and either save the world forever or destroy it forever in his rematch with the 'dark one'. It says he'll be born on or near Dragonmount. Every so often a regular man or a powered man declares himself Dragon. They're either hunted and killed or end up becoming warlords or emperors. The powered ones are always defeated. None ever end up the true Dragon.\n\n**Here's the twist that leads to nightmare fuel, for me, in the \"UFO context\".**\n\nThe Wheel of Time universe works like this (I may get some of the ages wrong--don't sweat it).\n\n1. We--you and I, reading reddit--live in the early 1st Age. The 1st Age ends with the cataclysm of Earth, several thousand years from now.\n2. The 2nd Age is post-apocalyptic hellscape. Unknown duration.\n3. The 3rd Age is things recovering and rebuilding. \n4. The 4th Age is where the story takes place. It's now like 10, 15 thousand years after the Dragon. One day, at last, the actual Dragon Reborn, the prophecy fulfilled, is born on the slopes of Dragonmount. The books are his story. He doesn't defeat the Dark One, but doesn't completely fail. \n5. Ages 5 though 7 continue to the end of the Earth, unknown fate. Presumably the sun expands and poof billions of years from now. The universe grows cold. Entropy. Collapse. Big crunch. Who knows.\n6. The Wheel of Time turns again, like with each age... and the universe and time begins again.\n7. We--you and I, reading reddit--live in the early 1st Age.\n8. This time maybe I'm a doctor. Maybe you die in infancy.\n9. The universe ends.\n10. We--you and I, reading reddit--live in the early 1st Age.\n\nEventually, the Dragon has a *finale* against the Dark One. I won't spoil it. It's a brilliant ending to a great book series (the middle third -IS- a slog, but the first and last thirds are legendarily great).\n\nThis is my worst case. \n\nOne day... maybe 2027... for whatever reason... we all go poof. Maybe moon-size orbs spin around Earth and... poof. Supernova. Gamma ray burst. Something.\n\nThen we do it again but don't know. We never advance. Is this immortality?\n\nYes, *technically*.

Except it changes everything about a lot of things we take for granted. Plus the question of \"why\" would they simulate us, here, and now? From a statistics perspective, what sort of sim would you expect to randomly find yourself in? I'd argue the most common simulations are probably going to be learning sims (training AI takes a LOT of trials), followed by a mix of historical sims and games. So if this is a simulation, then we're potentially unwittingly contributing data to minimize some cost function, and something big is probably going to happen soon. If this is a simulation. If I had to imagine worst case, given what we know about our reality so far, our sim is one of millions of parallel sims that some entity is running to learn how to most effectively defeat/cripple humanity (or getting us to do it to ourselves) while spending the least amount of energy possible. Or we're just some alien's equivalent of LLM chatbots learning how to evolve social behaviors over millions of trials and generations. Or we're their equivalent of Stable Diffusion and they just harvest our art/culture (and cows). \n\nIt's approximated that 117 billion humans have lived (as long as humans have been a thing). To find ourselves here and now, one of the 8 billion today, there's <7% chance we'd exist here and now (and that's assuming we're only selecting from humans). Basically a natural 20 (if you're an optimist)... or a natural 1 (if not). It might not be a coincidence we find ourselves living during the birth of the internet and on the cusp of true AI, cold fusion, a mass extinction event, disclosure, and who knows what other reveals that will change humanity forever. To some degree every generation probably feels that way (in an exponential curve, 'now' always looks like an elbow), but this time it seems qualitatively different, like all humanity (possibly all life on earth) either go extinction or interstellar-dimensional soon. \n\nIf we become aware it's a test (en masse) and it alters our behavior, do they terminate the trial?\n\nBut I think that would be existentially worse than learning that, say, the aliens are just more advanced lifeforms that have space ships and harvest a few humans for food or breeding every so often.

Congress is given a [177 page timeline](https://pdfhost.io/v/gR8lAdgVd_Uap_Timeline_Prepared_By_Another) that starts in 1947. This hearing sees the testimony of whistleblower David Grusch, David Fravor, and Ryan Graves. They are questioned for nearly two hours on their personal experiences, evidence they may have, as well as their opinions on how to handle it moving forward. Because of the official whistleblower protection channels Grusch goes through, he is not able to disclose intelligence that is still confidential, but offers names of both hostile and cooperative witnesses, as well as the specific locations of said retrieved craft if done through proper channels in closed session i.e. a [S.C.I.F.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/interactive/2023/scif-room-meaning-classified/) Unfortunately the hearing didn't have time for closing statements, but you can [read Grusch's closing statement here (as well as his opening statement)](https://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Dave_G_HOC_Speech_FINAL_For_Trans.pdf).

I believe it to be the best pacing for dissemination of information if you are new to the topic or a skeptic with an open mind.\n\n1. [UFOs: Investigating the Unknown](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/tv/shows/ufos-investigating-the-unknown). This is a documentary first released in January of 2023 by National Geographic that is the most up-to-date in terms of the timeline of recent events (sans the hearing) and will paint a broader picture of what is happening. You can watch it through the link I provided or find it on Disney+, Hulu, or anywhere else you get Nat Geo. It's only five episodes, each being around 42 minutes. It is not sensationalized in the slightest and has some fantastic witnesses, data, and history on the subject. Watch this one **first**.\n2. [The Phenomenon.](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13095604/) This 2020 documentary comes highly recommended by people in the community.\n3. [Bob Lazar: Area 51 & Flying Saucers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSkFkh-6XoA). This documentary centers around Bob Lazar, a whistleblower who first came out in the 1980s claiming to have worked at Area 51in a UFO reverse engineering program. Skeptics of Bob Lazar don't take him seriously, but there are a few things of note: first, he hasn't changed his story in thirty years. Second, he hasn't made a dime off of his claims (he wasn't paid for the documentary). Third, he claimed the craft he was reverse engineering used element 115, a synthetic element that did not exist in the 80s or 90s when he made the claims. However, in 2003, American and Russian scientists [successfully synthesized it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscovium). Watch this documentary with an open mind because it is worth watching considering Grusch's claims and the recent congressional hearing on UAP crash retrieval, as well as the language put forth in the UAP Disclosure Act of 2023. Here you can see [everything related to Bob Lazar](https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/15dyonx/comment/ju4qdkc/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) thanks to u/Rude_Conclusion_5907. **I don't make the claim that Bob Lazar is legit, only that his accounts are worth a second look given recent events. Take this one with a massive grain of salt and make your own decision.**\n4. [Moment of Contact](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt21451264/). This documentary covers the Varginha, Brazil incident of 1996. It is, in my opinion, one of the most compelling mass sighting and UAP cover-up stories there is. There are tons of witness testimony of well to do townsfolk who claim this event caused far more harm to them than good. One of the reasons I feel this is such a strong story given the congressional hearing is that it details a crashed craft that was swiftly retrieved by the United States Air Force.\n\n# Conclusion:\n\nI hope this post was elucidating to skeptics and knowers alike. I decided it best to keep the information here streamlined as not to overwhelm. If you deep dive into this post, and you like what you see, I recommend you stick around. Sorting in [r/UFOs](https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs) or [r/Aliens](https://www.reddit.com/r/Aliens) by top posts of all time will net some interesting results. See for yourself and make your own decision. I will leave you with this: ***\u201cFor decades, many Americans have been fascinated by objects mysterious and unexplained and it\u2019s long past time they get some answers. The American public has a right to learn about technologies of unknown origins, non-human intelligence, and unexplainable phenomena. We are not only working to declassify what the government has previously learned about these phenomena but to create a pipeline for future research to be made public. I am honored to carry on the legacy of my mentor and dear friend, Harry Reid and fight for the transparency that the public has long demanded surround these unexplained phenomena.\u201d*** \\-Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer",

Like there's much more to consciousness than we know, they can listen and even influence our thoughts.

That or its just our animal nature. \n\nVery tipsy rn and this is completely off topic but this is basically what I've been brainstorming the past few weeks. Trying to figure this shit out. I highly recommend everyone here look into religions/spiritualities and connect the similarities. I just don't understand the purpose for them creating us, and why there was what I imagine to be a disagreement and a split and that's why there's fallen angel's. God is misinterpreted as a single being and is likely the species or the group that created us by mixing genes with hominids. Tom delonge and elizondo have both said time is nonlinear, there's been multiple hints aliens can travel through time.

If there are aliens it makes way more sense for them to be interstellar travelers than interdimensional travelers. Here is a quick list of reasons:\n\n1. We know for a fact that it is possible for alien life to exist within our galaxy. We have found dozens of potentially habitable worlds within just a few hundred lightyears of Sol. \n\n2. Despite all the woowoo nonsense you might hear on YouTube, we do not know that alternate realities exist. No, quantum mechanics does NOT say there are infinite dimensions running in parallel that can be passed through on a whim. If there were, then it would require some way to break out of the universe- a task far, far more complicated than just traveling from star to star. \n\n3. We know that FTL travel is (hypothetically) possible. The Alcubierre warp drive doesn't violate the theory of relativity, just the ability to control gravity- something UAP's have demonstrated an ability do. \n\n4. Even if it isn't possible, you don't need an FTL drive to travel between stars. Using nothing but existing technology we could make a generational spacecraft capable of reaching Alpha Centauri within two hundred years, if given enough funding. \n\nIt just makes way, way more sense than assuming some parallel dimension woowoo is afoot.",

It\u2019s a guaranteed certainty their exists phenomena in the universe beyond our ability to perceive or indeed beyond our reach to perceive through technology. A great practical example is dark matter. We suspect this is real but have no way to perceive it, and currently cannot create a means to do so either. We can only observe it\u2019s theorized existence and effects. An inter dimensional being may be much the same, perhaps not so much an alternate reality thing as much as just beyond our ability to perceive.

If you stare at a visualization of a tesseract unfolding, you're kneejerk reaction is to say \"yea but that's not possible\".   However, it's an introduction to being able to ponder it.  Our pets will never use cellphones, to them they are magic, if they could even figure out what they do.  Hell I'm sure they're still magic to most people but it's easy to figure out how they work.  Same with engines, or planes, or nuclear reactors.   Whether they are from the milky way or not, they may have a history spanning millions of years.  Millions of years of scientific research.  Look what we have accomplished in the last 100.",
                "I think people mean different things when they say interdimensional. Some people are referring to parallel universes. Some people are referring to fourth dimensional structures. Some people are referring to realities that are on top of each other like layers of cellophane, where you can only see and interact with the layers beneath you, but not the layers above you.\n\nBecause the term probably means different things to different people, it can be appealing to a wide range of people",
                "I think the mixture of dimensionality with alternate reality within pop culture is to blame for this. We, as we understand it, live in a 4 dimensional universe- 3 spatial, 1 time. Superstring theory suggests 10 dimensions (not 6 other alternate realities, 6 further dimensions, not necessarily spatial), M-Theory suggests 11 dimensions, bosonic string theory suggests spacetime is 26 (!!) dimensions.  \nIf you take our 4D space- it's X, Y, Z and T- X, Y, Z to give you a location in 3D, a T for where we are in time (and oh look, that's never the same, also, unlike the others it moves in one direction, even if very, very slowly in some places, but we've never observed reversing T). Now, say we have the alphabet to suggest precisely 'where' we are, in space, in time, in existence. It does not suggest multi-universes, necessarily, just that our biosensors by dint of evolution (and evolution is a lazy worker), are only concerned with detect things in 4D.\n\nSo, how do you move from coordinates X, Y, Z to X, Y, Z? You can keep moving along those axis, in a direct line- spatially and constrained by those 3 dimensions, that the shortest path. A Alcubierre drive, is essentially implicitly acknowledging there is actually W axis, because if you can warp the XYZ, you have to warp it into something. That's suggested of a hypercube, 4D spatial dimensions, 1 of time. If there are more, there are more ways to get to a precise set of X, Y, Z coordinates without any travel along those axis- you travel on the others. That's what's missed in this because visualizing it is brain breaking (seriously, don't try, this is what math is for).\n\nClassical physics served us well, but it's reached its limits in really describing how reality works. When we talk extradimensionality, I would expect anything advanced enough to treat the 'weakest' of the 4 fundamental forces we've observed as a triviality has a very different and rather more complete view of how reality actually works.\n\nWhen I hear 'extradimensional', my reflexive reaction is 'no duh', to that. Same way we couldn't fly 500 years ago, we could only move via a 2D direction on to 3D topography, perhaps we should stop trying to think of ways to travel in 3D in a N dimensional spacetime.",

As specific as they want and not necessarily compatible with the universe they live in.\n\nJust for argument sake and for the sake of having a good philosophical chat about this.\n\nI mean. It\u2019s Not even that far fetched considering that with nuclear fusion we are creating a star in a lab as we speak, given enough time and scientific development we could be able to create a full blown universe ourselves.\n\nWhat if, we are that experiment. We are part of an artificially created universe in a lab. Time itself is a parameter strictly connected to our universe. 13.6B years in our universe could be 2 ours in theirs. Time exist only here.\n\nThis creator in this scenario would be living in extra dimensions outside of spacetime . And would have \u201cGod like\u201d powers by definition.\n\nIt could throw the experiment away any second and start over. And just like that, we are gone.\n\nOur creator could be the experiment of another being itself. \n\nAll of these are dimensions that contains other dimensions like a Russian doll. Where the doll as free will and is unaware of the outer shell.\n\nOf course these are pure speculations.  But if this was the big secret, I\u2019d rather not know.",

While you could travel 1000 light years and only one year might have passed on the ship, 1000 years are still going to have passed on earth. \n\nIf you are going to do it, sending out drones makes much more sense.

Even if the multi-generational ship was five times the demintions of a Trident submarine, with an adult crew of two hundred, the provisions for a two hundred year journey, would be daunting. Prolonged zero gravity, is a problem. To get there in two hundred years, would require a speed of about 4000 MPS. You would have to have enough reaction mass to attain  that speed, and then enough at the other end to decelerate from that speed. If you collided with even a pebble, it would go right through the ship. There is also a problem of heat. In deep space the temp hovers near absolute zero, what material would not become brittle at that temp. Interstellar travel is tremendously difficult, to the point of being almost impossible.

Or cutting through to a parallel universe at regions of \u201cthinness\u201d or spots where other incidents where large amounts of energy are released and maybe they also initially discovered those by mistake and have since then been making use of those windows to send drones and recon objects to keep tabs on society on this side. Another possibility is that these beings age slower or experience time differently.

Of course, this is arising from recent Reddit and 4chan posts about what we have, and the built up evidence over the last few decades.  Somehow I always thought if we come across aliens they will probably have entirely cool and different biology.  Like animals on earth itself are so damn cool and interesting and different.  The chances of the aliens on another planet being humanoid (walk on two legs, same general shape, etc., feels like a joke to me. But it\u2019s possible I suppose.

            "selftext": "Hello guys, many of you have probably seen me commenting over the past few months as I'm an experiencer myself but I have never posted giving my entire story. Just little bits of info here and there based off whatever comment I'm responding to. I will do my best to give details and things that I know without coming off in a bad way. Please feel free to ask any questions and try to be understanding that a 3 year experience cannot be explained in one simple reddit post. There will be details I leave out specifically to save time and not kill you all with a essay. Lets begin. \n\nFirst about me. I graduated high school and went straight to college but not mature enough in anyway so I ended up dropping out and going into the army as a medic. I spent 4 years in the military and was stationed at Fort bliss in El Paso, Tx. After I got out, I moved back to my home state and took a job working with my county doing ems for the 911 system. I spent 3 years doing this and eventually moved to the private sector. At 28 I was the assistant director of a 5 million a year private ems company. About a year ago I got out of ems totally and now work for a corporation. I know the amount of money I make does not matter in any way but a lot of humans simply cannot respect someone unless they have a professional career to back themselves up. For my state, the median household income is roughly 58k. That's household income and not individual. I currently make 65k a year. (I know id be poor in parts of the country but I'm very comfortable for my area) I have a very promising career and am not some guy who went crazy and developed schizophrenia. I simply wouldn't have maintained my career for the past 3 years if I had.  I only posted this info because this will be cross posted to multiple subs and some people need to hear more details than others. \n\nSo roughly 3 years ago my entire life changed. A mantis being made contact with me, and this is the story of my life and everything that has happened since then. And i need to state that at this time, I was a total atheist because of past trauma (If there was a god i hated him) and i would literally refuse to believe something if there wasn't definitive scientific proof. \n\nSo it started with shadows. I had quit my job because i had done so well with crypto investments i didnt need to work and i simply wanted to take a break after working ems through covid. That shit was rough guys. I actually thought i had developed some type of severe mental illness for a bit because I would see things move out the corner of my eye. I didnt believe in anything besides what i could physically see so this was quite jarring for me. This went on for weeks. Id wake up in the middle of the night feeling like i was being watched and i'd look in the corner and there it would be. Like a shadowy blob just looking down at me. Well after weeks of dealing with this and finally saying to myself  \"holy shit dude, youve gone fucking crazy\", I decided to try and test if i can physically interact with this thing. So one night when i woke up and saw it, i grabbed my dog and pointed it at the corner and thats when everything changed. She walked right up to it and sniffed it. It was the first time i had confirmation that something was happening from someone other than me, even if it was just a dog. So thats when i actively reached out to it. I would call to it openly saying \"I know you are here. What do you want? why are you in my house?\" And then the dreams started. \n\nEvery single night id go to bed and i would be sitting on a chair on a beach and it was always the same one. The beach i grew up at with my family. A old man simply walked up to me one day and goes \"do you want to talk about the universe?\" Of course i was like fuck yes i do. So we started talking. He told me all sorts of things i found absolutely fascinating. He would ask me a question like \"do you think water is alive?\" and then when i responded using human knowledge he would challenge my way of thinking. In the case of the water his response to me saying it wasnt alive was this. \"Every single thing a 3 dimensional being puts into its body is alive. You have to take life to maintain life. The meat and plants you eat were all alive at one point right? Every single substance of value you put into your body was alive at one point. If that statement is true for all \"food\" then why would you assume that water wasnt alive as well. Its vitally more important than food. Does it not give you more energy and life than any food can?\" I was kinda shook because although i didnt believe what he was saying, i didnt know how to argue his logic. Everything i eat is alive. Obviously artifical candies are not technically food as you cannot survive on them. He was specifically talking about life giving food. Meats and plants that give us the basic nutrients to keep living. I simply told him id think about the concept more. \n\nThat is just one example of a conversations we had. This happened nightly for 3 months straight. Another conversation we had was about our galaxy. He stated that the galaxy is actually a upwards vortex and as we spin around it we are physically moving upwards through the different dimensional spaces. And it was this conversation that it happened. He told me that statement then asked what i thought about it. And thats when it hit me. I was thinking. Like there i was sitting on this beach talking to this man and thinking but yet i suddenly KNEW i was in my bed asleep. How could i possibly be thinking in a dream? As i looked over to ask him about this he had the biggest shit eating grin on his face and he simply said \"finally catching on huh? its time to wake up\" and i said \"how is this happening? how am i thinking and controlling my thoughts within a dream. I dont understand this.\" And he responded with \"You are not asleep my friend, if you want to continue contact then you need to began meditating. If you do this, I will come back to you.\" \n\nAnd that was it, no more dreams. No more weird shadows. Everything just stopped but yet i was still here and truly couldnt even begin to understand what had happened to me. I was sure i had gone crazy. But I desperately wanted to talk to this man that had quickly become my friend. The conversations we had were amazing and i was willing to try to meditate just to have a chance to speak with him again. Even if its all in my head, he was comforting to me and i wanted more of it. So i started meditating. \n\nThe next two years became quite the blur. I went through so many changes I cant even begin to describe them. But we started talking through meditation and he would come back to me in my sleep but I had to genuinely try to talk during meditation for it to happen. He wasnt letting me use him as a free pass to not learn. And thats when he started telling me what he says is the truth of the universe. \n\nHe says there are over 500 advanced civilizations in the milky way galaxy and that the galactic federation is very real. He told me that 113 of these have done 113 different scientific experiments definitively proving the existence of god, a divine consciousness, or the source as they call him. They call him the source because hes the source of everything. He said they expect humanity to come up with the 114th experiment because we are such a curious species and we are the next civilization that will enter the federation. One of these experiments he explained like this : so humans have now figured out quantum entanglement is very real.  Quantum entanglement is **a bizarre, counterintuitive phenomenon that explains how two subatomic particles can be intimately linked to each other even if separated by billions of light-years of space**. (sorry for the bold letters, i copied and pasted off google) Despite their vast separation, a change induced in one will affect the other. They said they developed a technology to literally latch onto a consciousness. To them, consciousness is not local and this is one of the key things they are here to teach humanity. So they simply waited as these beings with these tags all died naturally. (They didnt kill anyone for an experiment) And then they watched as every single one did the exact same thing. They all went back to the exact same place in the universe and then was sent back out later into a new body and they were able to physically go to these beings and meet them and actually remove the tag they had placed. Reincarnation is very real. Thats just one experiment out of the 113.\n\nHe told me that the solar system and the earth itself is moving into 4th dimensional space. This is a very physical change. Remember how i said we are a upwards vortex and going up through the dimensions? This is that. The actual space we are moving into is 4th dimensional and they are here to help elevate humanities consciousness so that we will be ready for this very real physical change that is coming. He says that every human is currently making a choice. Service to self or service to others. This is a very personal choice that is made by your greater consciousness which has all the knowledge of all your past lives. You get to decide where you want to go. He said that there is a cluster of quasars at the center of the galaxy and our solar system is coming to what we can consider perpendicular to these quasars. (I know theres no direction in space, i worded it that way for a reason) They are emitting gravitational waves and as these waves have started to hit our solar system, the planet itself (Gaia, the native americans got that right and shes very much alive) and many of the beings on the planet have begun to have a natural shift in their own consciousness to help prepare them. These gravitational waves hitting us are what is causing the shift into the 4th dimension. This is a very physical change and short of straight up taking the earth and moving her lower in the galaxy, it cannot be stopped. Its a totally natural event that all civilizations go through. Humanity is rare in a sense that most planets are either one of the other. Meaning the entire planet is service to self or service to others. They say we are a mix with about 5-10% of the population has chosen or will choose service to self, roughly 60% has chosen or will chose service to others and 20% will choose not to choose because they are not ready to leave the duality than mankind currently exist in. They say thats why we experience such extremes of love and hate right now so that we can learn which path we want to take later on. \n\nHe preaches endlessly about unconditional love. He tells me to go love, love some more, and when I feel like ive loved enough, stand up, force myself to walk up to a random stranger and love some more. Just love over and over and over. Honestly guys its kinda exhausting. Its like, im human bro. Doing that is actually hard. I dont want to talk to random people! And i damn sure dont wanna have to be mindful of my words every second of every day but he takes it beyond that. Telling me to even physically stop what im doing and address these negative thoughts. Think about why im having this negative thought, analyze it, understand why i feel this way, then simply let it go. He tells me to practice this every single second and if i catch myself not doing this, immediately address it. \n\nFor three years this went on. Ill be totally honest guys, in the back of my head the entire time i was totally like \"You've gone fucking insane.\" But i couldnt deny one thing. I WAS CHANGING. It didnt matter if this was all a figment of my imagination. I was actually changing. No more chasing money. No more random hook ups. No more yelling at people because they made me mad. I was praying to a god i didnt even know if i believed in simply because this being was sooooo sure of it. And i couldnt deny that while i had no actual physical proof, i was actually changing. I was no longer having to force myself to be nice. It was just happening. I started volunteering. I started helping and giving my money away, just keeping enough to pay my bills and eat. I was genuinely trying to be the best human i could possibly be. \n\nAnd then 3 months ago, something just happened. I need to preface this by saying i understand how egotistical it sounds and im just describing it the best i can. But i went into what i can only call a elevated state. I was not reacting negatively to anything. Like anything guys. I had a random stranger like full blown yell in my face and i just smiled and told them i love them. 3 years ago id have been in a actual fight over that. But eventually this state ended and i came back down to earth and i suddenly realized how much pain and suffering is surrounding me. Thats when it happened. One night he said \"start telling your story, some things have changed and we will need your voice later. Do not worry if they dont believe you, simply reading these words will help their subconscious during the transition later.\" So i started talking on reddit but they kept pushing more and more. Talk more. Be louder. Tell people in real life. And so finally i was fed up. I was like dude... Ive never even physically seen you other than a weird shadow or when you told me to take shrooms. I was high that doesnt count. I had never taken them before i met this being and the only drugs i do is occasionally smoke weed. I basically said im not doing it. I have a good career, im a respectable man in my community. I know youve helped me and ive changed but like why should i do this. \n\nAnd then he came. I had just gotten home from work as i had been working nights so i come home and get in bed and as im laying down i just noticed a weird light. I had my windows closed but its daylight outside and it was like how youll see light act weird as a car passes by a window. I even said to myself \"That looked weird. Its like a car went by but i didnt hear a car.\" so i just sat there watching and it slowly formed into his face. It was right there in front of me. The face of the being i had been talking to for 3 years. The being i had started to refer to as my best friend. A legitimate 100% Praying Mantis head. Just right there. I simply said \"Thank you for being my friend. I love you.\" He winked and then left. That night he came and made a joke. They have quite the sense of humor. The very first thing he said to me was literally \"Well you saw me now, start talking bitch!\" It was quite hilarious having a alien call me a bitch. By the way he hates the word alien. He prefers me to call him a being. He says \"How can we be alien and not belong when we were here first?\" \n\nSo now I'm here telling my story. The past 3 months have really kicked off. Ive now meet 9 different species after 3 years of only talking to him. I have more experiences and can speak on them as well but this is enough for now. I can answer any questions you guys might want to ask but understand i may simply say I dont know because i dont know everything. Even with the more recent developments and my confidence skyrocketing, i still sometimes feel like im stumbling along in the dark with no answers. But im on a journey to find them and share them with you all. So please, ask away. I love you all! \n\nThey gave me what they say is my personal proof. And here it is. HUMAN BEINGS ARE KNOWN FOR OUR STRAIGHT LINES BECAUSE THERE ARE NO STRAIGHT LINES. He said this is simply because of the physical ways our eyes evolved to experience this 3d reality around us but that no straight lines exist anywhere in the universe. We basically invented them. We arent special or something, its just a unique way humanity evolved physically.\n\nPlease be aware that this is but a tiny fraction of what has happened to me. Its impossible to write 3 years worth of information into one post and keep peoples attention.",

The EBO Biologist poster a month ago mentioned something very much this in their comments when speaking about alien religion and purpose.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/aliens/comments/14rp7w9/from_the_late_2000s_to_the_mid2010s_i_worked_as_a/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=aliens&utm_content=t1_jquf4i6\n\n>Question 3: I havent read everything in detail but can you expend on the document on their religion?\n\n>EBOs believe that the soul is not an extension of the individual, but rather a fundamental characteristic of nature that expresses itself as a field, not unlike gravity. In the presence of life, this field acquires complexity, resulting in negative entropy if that makes sense. This gain in complexity is directly correlated with the concentration of living organisms in a given location. With time, and with the right conditions, life in turn becomes more complex until the appearance of sentient life. After reaching this threshold, the field begins to express itself through these sentient beings, forming what we call the soul. Through their life experiences, sentient beings will in turn influence the field in a sort of positive feedback loop. This in turn further accelerates the complexity of the field. Eventually, when the field reaches a \"critical mass\", there will be a sort of apotheosis. It's not clear what this means in practical terms, but this quest for apotheosis seems to be the EBOs main motivation.\n\n>The author of the document added his reflections and interpretations as an appendix. He specified that, for them, the soul field is not a belief but an obvious truth. He also argues that the soul loses its individuality after death, but that memory and experience persist as part of the field. This fact would influence the philosophy and culture of EBOs, resulting in a society that doesn't fear death but which places no importance or reverence on individuality. This \"belief\" compels them to seed life, shape it, nurture it, monitor it and influence it for the ultimate purpose of creating this apotheosis. Paradoxically, they have little or no respect for an individual's well-being.\n\n>Please be advised that I'm speaking from memory of something I read more than 10 years ago, so take the following with a grain of salt. Also, I'm not a philosopher or an artist, so please excuse my struggle to properly formulate the concepts and my dry terminology. Finally, note that this information comes from a document whose author was directly interacting with an EBO. It is not specified whether it was an ambassador, a crash survivor, a prisoner. The means of communication were not specified either.",

While a significant portion seemed implausible, the overwhelming advancements over the past 6-12 months, notably highlighted in the EBO post ([link](https://www.reddit.com/r/aliens/comments/14rp7w9/from_the_late_2000s_to_the_mid2010s_i_worked_as_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)), suggest we are on the cusp of a paradigmatic transformation (apotheosis?). The socio-technological phenomena we're witnessing might well align with the profound dimensional shifts some have fervently speculated about. The volume of converging indicators is too substantial to be casually disregarded.\r  \n\r  \nI harbor a deep-seated aspiration that my intuition aligns with reality. Our current global narrative, fraught with dissonance and unrest, beckons for rejuvenation. It is high time we transitioned into a future imbued with hope and purpose.",

                "Considering the [alleged 177 page Alien timeline document given to congress](https://pdfhost.io/v/gR8lAdgVd_Uap_Timeline_Prepared_By_Another), there are so many different claims in there that this is essentially a conspiracy theorist's wishlist/checklist. \n\nThere is so much conflicting information on what they are in there and a claimed 7 different ways anti-gravity could be achieved, that I think *every* claim is correct. Not one or the other. \n\nThat means there are:\n\n1. Interdimensional aliens\n\n2. Probably actual from Space aliens\n\n3. Time travel aliens where they are from our future trying to avert disaster\n\n4. Demons\n\n5. Angels\n\n6. Scientology is right, Xenu is real, people's souls are actually recycled, and they have been trying to accomplish some nefarious goal using reincarnation.\n\n7. Lizard people who control the government and live among us\n\nand a variety of other alien species and conspiracy theories.\n\n*(Just to be clear, these types of aliens really are all claims quoted from various witnesses in the document, not me)*\n\nSo from our Pop Sci/Pop Culture, mix the multiverse from the marvel movies with stuff like looper or Steins;Gate, actual space aliens, angels, demons, interdimensional species, everything.\n\nIt's *all* true, simultaneously. Probably anything else you can think of too. Vampires? Sure why not. Zombies? Go for it.\n\nIf the extra-dimensional theory is actually true, that means *everything* likely exists out there somewhere. There is no discrimination between theories actually necessary, they're all right. \n\nThe document even has witnesses who claim(which is just wildly unbelievable) that Dolphins actually are the smartest species on the planet. Meaning Douglas Adams book So Long And Thanks For All The Fish is historically accurate/predicted the future.\n\nHonestly, the most fucked up part of this to me is if that doc is correct, we're going to have a *lot* of apologizing to do to conspiracy theorists. Can you just *imagine* how superior they would feel for the rest of their lives? The amount of \"I told you so's\" will never, ever end.\n\nThe doc alleges that Jon Podesta, Hillary Clinton and other democratic figures in the Q conspiracy are *actually* involved in this. The US would probably immediately descend into a civil war if that was revealed to be true. I think that would be a dark fucking day, having to admit the Q people were right and having to eat crow.\n\nThat whole doc is just a mindfuck, because on the infinitesimally small chance that it's real(think winning the powerball), we must somehow be in a simulation. The writer's idea to make every conspiracy theory a reality simultaneously is actually too hard to believe. \n\nYou're telling me that this nebulous web of disparate conspiracy theories in all sectors of life that shouldn't be related are actually all part of one gigantic spider-web shaped plot? I struggle to believe that they didn't include Big Foot and Nessie in there too. It'll look like those boards you see in conspiracy shows and crime shows, with pins and threads going from all these different things. Like the Pepe Silvia chart Charley made in It's Always Sunny.\n\nI'll say it again, that doc is a conspiracy theorist's wet dream. I don't know how I'm going to react if it's actually true, it's too much of a what the fuck for me to even contemplate it all. \n\nIf every theory I've ever dismissed because they all sound looney toons is actually true, I don't even know where I go from there. What's next? Astrology and Homeopathy are actually correct?\n\nMaybe we're living in the Stranger Than Fiction universe, somebody writes and invents an idea, and suddenly, it just pops into reality and it's true. E.g. Someone invents the concept for a vampire zombie hybrid, boom, it snaps into existence and it's real.\n\nSo what do I think is going to happen? If you have read the His Dark Materials series, basically what happens at the end. An interdimensional war between every world and dimension.\n\nAnd so, we end up with a [The Ultimate Showdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrzKT-dFUjE) or South Park's Imaginationland type scenario, where every whacko theories group ends up warring with each other.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nHonestly it sounds completely unbelievable to me, but I'm keeping an open mind. It's hard not to scoff at the absurdity of it all, but one of the tenants I live by is always be willing to listen to the other side's opinion and admit you are wrong if you're wrong. There's no shame in being wrong, as long as you're willing to admit it and grow.\n\nI never gave credulity to an Aliens theory prior to the testimony in Congress. It all seemed so out there I didn't really devote any mental energy to it. The fact that Congress is suddenly very concerned and the Witnesses appear to very credible changed my mind to \"well it's worth paying attention to on the off chance this is real\". \n\nI can't just dismiss Aliens out of hand any more. I'm more than happy to admit I was wrong before. God damn, I kind of hope I'm wrong. Shit would get so much more interesting.\n\nBut this document was probably put together just to make fun of us and see how much ridiculous shit we're willing to believe when it seems satirical. I found a few typos in there too, which seems unlikely to have been missed in a document that was probably proofread a number of times.\n\nBut hey, again, if it's real, I'll be the first one to say I'll admit I was wrong.",

Governments would probably hit us hard with propaganda and try to convince us that we needed to give more money to weapons/military programs.  This is an important point for a few paragraphs down.  I'd expect to hear a lot of, \"If an alien ship lands in MY yard, I'm going to...\" threats from citizens.  I think some of that's natural, reacting out of fear.  \n\nI think hard disclosure would bring down religions.  Then you may have some people who'll say, \"Screw it all,\" because religion was the only thing keeping them from going absolutely batshit on their neighbors.  I'm from an area where people are heavily influenced by religion and are already convinced aliens are fallen angels or demons or evil beings who are here to do everything to us that we do to other humans.   \n\n\nI think governments and people in power would be the most afraid because they have the most to lose.  I mean, can you imagine if they've been hiding it (and potential advanced technology/science/medicine) for decades or longer, *especially if those things came from what the government* ***knew*** *to be a peaceful species*, convincing us to give more and more and more and more money to defense programs, lying to us the whole time?  Once the truth came out, I could see governments falling in a heartbeat.  And if aliens can show us better ways to do things, such as provide food to everyone, provide free and/or cheap energy, show us more efficient health care techniques/open accessibility, and/or help us off our dependency from money and/or resources that cost money, I could easily see corporations falling. Imagine the reaction from people who've been struggling to survive or lost someone to something that could have been prevented by something the people up top were hoarding for themselves.   \n\n\nBetween the governments and corporations fighting like hell to keep their power and money, a big chunk of the world's population working off their Purge list because they think disclosure is The End, and others trying to push unity, I think it'd kind of be like a big worldwide civil war.  Not really countries against each other, just a bunch of people arguing about how the other side \"should be\" reacting to the disclosure and some fighting that gets out of control on top of the initial chaos that, IMO, would eventually calm down.    \n\n\nAnd all the while, I just imagine aliens standing there like, \"Y'all are wild.  Let us know when you want us to show you how to make that replicator that Bernard was talking about.\"   \n\n\nIdk. I probably have an overactive imagination about these things lol.",

The rich may have hid sources of energy or Advanced Technologies (ATs) while destroying the planet for profit. Reform of worldwide governance or a hopefully brief turn towards authoritarianism is possible.\n2. A global cold war to reverse engineer ATs is revealed or ensues.\n3. Systematic study of the UAP phenomenon reveals only statistical information about the craft and NHI aka no meaningful first contact. Any NHI would understand dark forest theory and therefore hide their location - including using only Earth materials to make their craft/biologics.\n4. Our current technology may not be of human origin or we may be on the brink of a technological breakthrough. Open study of the craft allows science to unify gravity and quantum mechanics or a similar breakthrough.\n\nUltimately, I think either we merge with our technology and become immortal in the next few hundred years or are destroyed by ourselves or NHI. The argument is: if we live as a species for millions of years and stay mortal, we will create trillions of humans. It is much more likely that if that future existed, you would be born as one of those humans and not have essentially won the lottery by being born now. \n\nIf we are destroyed or stop making very many humans after becoming immortal then the fact that you exist now with 9 billion other living humans, amongst the 50 billion or so humans that ever exist is a pretty reasonable bet.\n\nDisclosure has the potential to be the inciting event for the next or final age of humanity.",

                "I find it suspicious that the US government shared videos of UFO's and played dumb: \"We have no idea what they are.\"\n\nReally? It's a fact that governments lie. What happened with Covid and the pandemic eroded any trust I had in the government. It's a lie on top of a lie. \n\nI've learned one important thing with humans, if somebody lies to me, they've clearly lied about other things. Why do they they feel the need to lie? If someone is comfortable with lying, they've been doing it for a while, and they don't have any moral conflict about it.\n\nSuch people will say whatever they need to say in order to manipulate me (or you). People lie to manipulate, and the same logic applies to governments.\n\nI remember in the videos, they show the UFO traveling over water and then dropping straight down into the ocean. They claimed they had no idea what could do that.\n\n Case in point: US patent US10144532B2\nBy: Salvatore Pais / 2016\nHe currently works for US Space Force\n\n---\n\"It is possible to envision a hybrid aerospace/undersea craft (HAUC), which due to the physical mechanisms enabled with the inertial mass reduction device, can function as a submersible craft capable of extreme underwater speeds (lack of water-skin friction) and enhanced stealth capabilities (non-linear scattering of RF and sonar signals). This hybrid craft would move with great ease through the air/space/water mediums, by being enclosed in a vacuum plasma bubble/sheath, due to the coupled effects of EM field-induced air/water particles repulsion and vacuum energy polarization.\"\n------\n\nIf aliens have been visiting earth for decades, it could mean a lot of things, and many of the possibilities are ugly.\n\nIt's possible that earth is a giant farm, and we're all cattle being used to increase the population for something sinister. To become food? Slaves to aliens? As an experiment for knowledge? Maybe covid19 was a way for aliens to test the vaccine.\n\nI know these are unlikely, and I'm just imagining a world where everything we've been told is false, and we've been manipulated and lied to for reasons unknown.\n\nI'm not a conspiracy theorist. I value science and real data, but my mind has been wondering if everything is inevitable, big lie.\n\nIt seems odd that all of a sudden, the US government releases videos that appear otherworldly, and they don't have a clue what they are.\n\nHere's a hypothesis. The Pentagon knows exactly what those UFO's are. They reverse engineered alien craft that either crashed or was captured. They developed similar technology and have been testing it for decades.\n\nThe videos also get society accustomed to the idea that aliens might exist, so when they reveal the truth, people don't freak out. It's working because although people are talking about it, it seems strange that we're not freaking out about the possibility of it.\n\nSince when do confessions of alien life by the government become just another news story.\n\nPeople have been bombarded with a lot of strange behavior on TikTok and youTube. There has been a desensitizing in humans. Nearly everyone is indifferent and have become used to seeing weird things online.\n\nThe world stopped making sense for me since the pandemic. Too many lies and strange behavior from the leaders of the world. We were used guineau pigs during the pandemic. They tested a brand new technology on us and said it was safe.\n\nIt wasn't. Millions of people are suffering due to Covid, and it's barely talked about. There is a common thread where decisions are made and everyday citizens pay the price, and nobody is accountable.\n\nIsn't this how scientists treat animals in experiments or farmers who care for the farm animals until the day they are sent to the slaughterhouse.\n\nBTW, I was vaccinated twice with the modern vaccine. I'm not anti-vaccine. Well, I wasn't before Covid.\n\nAnyway, I know it all sounds nuts. And I am not saying anything I have said is true. I'm just wondering aloud, questioning what's behind all of the lies. \n\nThings no longer add up. I have no agenda. I am not religious. The truth is the only thing i'm interested in. I'm curious what other people have been thinking about. Please, enlighten me and tell me I'm nuts. Tell me everything is exactly as it looks.\n\nAnd Ai might just destroy us. Unemployment will be astronomical. But I won't say any more.\n\nAgain, I'm just brainstorming.

We are merely one species that evolved on a planet that could have been observed, or even conquered, by automated scouting teams from these unknown entities long before our existence.\n\nWe've just recently started to become aware of their presence, not because they have begun to show interest in us, but rather as a byproduct of our own technological and scientific advancements. Like a maturing civilization finally noticing the unnoticed aspects of its environment, we're starting to perceive these visitors not because they've changed, but because we have.\n\nOur planet, from their perspective, could be one among countless others in their purview, and our existence is perhaps just a footnote in their long history of exploration.",

At the scales they are testing every material shows a significant increase in strength due to a lack of defects from what I understand. Its interesting and probably significant for the field but you wont see cars made from it.   \n\n\nThe DNA is used as basically a scaffolding for the silicon atoms to attach to and replace (think fossilization). If I understand correctly, the reason DNA is used is because it both forms very long chains that can be programmed to fold up in very precise and repeatable ways, after all it naturally is extremely folded up within a cell so we just need to edit where it folds and by how much. Apparently this has been practice from at least 2016.  \n\n\nYou can actually see everyone who invested and contributed at the bottom of the paper too, so your first question is answered. Even if you believe that aliens are behind every major scientific breakthrough, you then have to ask who helped them? Far enough down the chain someone had to invent these things on their own, so why couldn't humanity? To discredit the ingenuity of our species simply because you yourself can not understand how something is done is an incredible disservice to everyone who brought us to where we are today, there is no reason we can't be every bit as smart as any other civilization out in the stars who made the same discoveries as we did.",

Almost like Magnatiles, **pieces of DNA of specific lengths and chemistry snapped themselves together into a skeleton of the material**. Imagine the frame of a house or building, but made of DNA. Oleg Gang and Aaron Mickelson, nanomaterials scientists at Columbia University and Brookhaven\u2019s Center for Functional Nanomaterials, **then coated the DNA with a very thin layer of glass-like material only a few hundred atoms thick**. The glass only just coated the strands of DNA, leaving a large part of the material volume as empty space, much like the rooms within a house or building.\n\n> **The DNA skeleton reinforced the thin, flawless coating of glass making the material very strong**, and **the voids comprising most of the material\u2019s volume made it lightweight**. As a result, glass nanolattice structures are four times higher in strength but five times lower in density than steel.\n\nThis reminds me of how (when we ask AI to design stuff)[https://www.bmw.com/en/design/ai-design-and-digital-art.html], it'll come up with these [intricate, biological-looking designs](https://www.bmw.com/content/dam/bmw/marketBMWCOM/bmw_com/categories/Design/future-design/fd-04-media-wide.png?imwidth=1280) that are super efficient with the way they use space as much as material, and usually kind of look like something almost organic or grown. Only, they've now gotten this design approach down to a microscopic level and now it *is* organic and grown, just with a guiding hand.\n\nIt also kind of lovingly massages my tinfoil-covered conspiracy G-spot that there's some sort of connection between this *self-assembling DNA* approach and [von Neumann probes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-replicating_spacecraft), like this is a first tentative step towards those. Maybe they're biologically based, and they can 3D-print themselves; if they have a [stem cell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell#Self-renewal) for this DNA structure, they can just replicate it endlessly for their craft materials. Kind of like that 4Chan guy mentioned with their undersea, bespoke probe-churning factory...\n\n> \u201cI am a big fan of Iron Man movies, and I have always wondered how to create a better armor for Iron Man. It must be very light for him to fly faster. It must be very strong to protect him from enemies\u2019 attacks. Our new material is five times lighter but four times stronger than steel. So, our glass nanolattices would be much better than any other structural materials to create an improved armor for Iron Man.\u201d\n\nI love that he's a total nerd.",

The corresponding authors (people in charge of the research) are from University of Connecticut, but other listed authors positions at Columbia and Brookhaven National Laboratory.\n\nFor **funding**, we can look at the Acknowledgments section towards the end of the article. Funding is from the US Department of Energy (contract no. DE-SC0012704, and grant DE-SC0008772) and the US Department of Defense (W911NF-19-1-0395).

            "title": "Reverse Engineering of Non-Human Technology is Real: Watch NewsNation\u2019s Coverage of Whistleblower David Grusch Joseph Burkes MD 2023",
            "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\nSomething truly remarkable is happening surrounding the revelations of former intelligence official David Grusch concerning the existence of classified projects aimed at reverse engineering non-human (aka alien) technology. As revealed on the 6-5-23 \u201cNeed to Know\u201d podcast, Hollywood screenwriter Bryce Zabel and Australian journalist Ross Coulthart covered the astounding testimony of Mr. Grusch at classified briefings for United States Congressional Intelligence Committees. The testimony was reportedly given under oath and was some 11 hours in length.   \n\n\nCoulthart stated that he was not able to interest the New York Times, or the Washington Post or CNN and MSNBC in the story. But a small media outlet called NewsNation has produced a one hour in depth program on David Grusch with portions of Coulthart\u2019s seven-hour interview with the 36-year-old former high-ranking intelligence official. He was a staff member for the Pentagon\u2019s UAP Taskforce. Before last night I had never heard of NewsNation. It is not offered on my Samsung TV platform, but I was able to find it on the Amazon fire TV service.   \n\n\nAs a lead up to the one hour special, NewsNation has produced a series of short five-minute interviews that are jampacked with information about the astounding revelations of David Grusch. They can be found on the NewsNation YouTube channel. The audience response has been enthusiastic. Typically, NewsNation YouTube posting have 500 to a few thousand views. The number of views on the stories covering this young whistleblower are going up thousands per hour.   \n\n\nIn the interview linked below UFO researcher/filmmaker Jeremy Corbell acknowledges that although Grusch has not seen alien artifacts or been part of reverse engineering projects, his connections within the Pentagon and his high level of clearance put him in a position to learn about the kind of deep \u201cblack\u201d projects that he has described. Furthermore, David Grusch is not alone. According to Jeremy Corbell primary witnesses to these highly classified programs have identified themselves to Corbell, and Grusch\u2019s testimony now makes it more possible for them to come forward and tell what they know. These developments put the ball on the government\u2019s side of the court and now they must investigate the claims of additional whistleblowers who can be placed under oath and give sworn testimony. \n\nDavid Grusch has thus provided a road map for such crucial investigations. From what I have seen of him in the last two days, my impression is that he is as genuine and well informed as he appears. He is providing an important service to not only the American people, but to all of humanity.   \n\n\nI urge all contact and disclosure activists to view the NewsNation videos that are being released on YouTube, share them with friends and family and see the one hour special to be aired later this week. \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfZQRxdvgss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfZQRxdvgss)",

            "selftext": "On the 26th of July, 2023, a congressional hearing was held, under the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability, in which a former intelligence official made some claims about extraterrestrials. On that same day, 2023 July 26, 2023, Reuters announced that weapons maker Lockheed Martin has been awarded a contract by a U.S. Department of Defense agency to develop a nuclear-powered spacecraft for the purposes of exploration and national defense. This didn't make it into headlines because, you see, people was distracted with news about aliens.\n\n-\u201cThe Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) awarded the contract to Lockheed under a project called Demonstration Rocket for Agile Cislunar Operations (DRACO). The military part of the project remains classified. The in-space flight demonstration of a nuclear thermal rocket engine vehicle will take place no later than 2027, as per Mr. Shireman's statements to the press.\u201d\n-At the same time Mr. Grusch was talking at the Congress about alien technologies being recovered and reverse-engineered, Lockheed Martin team members were having their press conference about the DRACO spacecraft.\n-\u201cLockheed Martin said the project is an advancement in propulsion technology from chemical propulsion engines to nuclear thermal propulsion (NTP) engines. The idea is that these more powerful and efficient nuclear thermal propulsion systems can provide faster transit times between destinations. Reducing transit time is vital for human missions to Mars to limit a crew's exposure to radiation. That's what Kirk Shireman, vice president of Lunar Exploration Campaigns at Lockheed Martin Space, said. When asked about the military side of the project, he refused to comment. When asked whether it is a good idea to have nuclear-powered military sats orbiting Earth, he refused to comment.\u201d\n-\u201cWhen NASA was approached about project DRACO, they replied both NASA and the U.S. military plan to launch a nuclear-powered spacecraft to Earth orbit in late 2025 or early 2026. NASA added that the goal of the project is to give an in-space test to nuclear thermal propulsion (NTP), potentially revolutionary tech that could help humanity set up shop on Mars and other distant worlds. When directly asked about the military aspect of the project, they declined any answer.\u201d\n\n\n\n--- The following I found on Forgottenlanguagues.org\" I don't know whos quotes this are.---\n\n- \u201cThe real conspiracy is simply to convince not the public, but the decision makers, that extraterrestrials exist. What the average citizen believes or disbelieves no longer matters. What matters is to create a majority of senators and congressmen who believe in extraterrestrials. That is our job here. Only then can we deploy nuclear weapons in space with the blessing of the politicians. Do you get it now? We assume the risk that there could be a catastrophic accident, and that is why we need to disguise our project behind the curtain of a civilian project: the DRACO project. We can always admit that an experimental NASA spacecraft whose propulsion is based on a nuclear thermal engine has crashed in a medium-sized city, but we could never confess that a military nuclear satellite has fallen on a city. Never.\u201d\n\n- \u201cThey have run out of ideas. It is very difficult to convince the civilian population that the next war will no longer be in a remote place where bombs always fall on others. In the next war, bombs will fall on your city, and some of those bombs will be radioactive. You might want to prepare a scenario in which a nuclear-powered alien spacecraft crashes into a medium-sized city. This way we kill two birds with one stone: we make the population aware that the possibility of being bombed is real and that they should assume it, and on the other hand we blame the aliens for any nuclear incident.\"\n- \"we know there are people pushing to establish international norms on how to inspect nuclear materials and other related technological developments for use in outer space, and we will do everything at hand to silence them. Furthermore, we don't care whether NASA plans for using highly-enriched uranium in space translates into the United States establishing a dangerous precedent.\u201d\n\u201cSince NASA has not made a final decision on whether it will use LEU fuel or HEU fuel, there is still time to consider if we seriously need HEU for space projects. On the earth, there are norms and regulations to reduce the risks of nuclear proliferation; in outer space, there are fewer rules governing nuclear materials and yet the dangers posed by proliferation still exist. Anyway, let's talk about David Grusch and the aliens instead of our plans to deploy nuclear weapons in space, right?\n-\u201cTechnological risks require society to perceive the relationship between technology and technological disasters as unavoidable. But when it comes to nuclear military technology no one wants to hear about accidents, so having nuclear missiles orbiting over our cities is not something people are going to approve of. It's funny that if it were alien spacecrafts, no one would care whether or not those spacecrafts were powered by nuclear engines. It's as if anything extraterrestrial is better viewed in the eyes of the public, and that's precisely what we have to take advantage of. So yes, get ready to hear news about alien spacecrafts... powered by nuclear engines.\u201d",

                "The hearing wasn't all over the news, though. It was there, but I don't buy the distraction aspect. They could easily just... not report on it. A lot of humans aren't toddlers, and are very capable of taking in more than one news story at a time.",
                "4 things:\n\nUFO disclosure is bigger news than nuclear contracts.\n\nThere wasn't enough media reporting on the congressional hearings to distract anyone. The only people who even paid attention to the hearing were people who are already interested in the topic, which is a smaller percentage of people than it should be.\n\nThe news doesn't report on a lot of important topics. (Plus who honestly watches the news in 2023?)\n\nWe can focus on more than one thing at a time.",
                "DRACO is not a nuclear weapon. It is a nuclear reactor used to power a rocket engine. Nuclear reactors in space are nothing new. The first nuclear reactor in orbit, SNAP-10A, was American, and launched all the way back in 1965. And we already have systems for putting nuclear weapons in space to strike our enemies - ICBMs. There are currently hundreds of them sitting in North Dakota and Montana. No alien stories to Congress required.",
                "Nice try.\n\n1. The topic is everything but \"everywhere\". It has been barely covered, and when it was, it was done poorly, mostly in a dismissive way. \n2. If you want to distract the public away from Lockheed Martin maybe, MAYBE, you might want to use a topic that doesn't DIRECTLY call Lockheed Martin into the conversation. The pressure on the private aerospace companies is only just started. Congress is out for blood. \n3. You cannot discard 80 years of military reports from all over the world. While I agree that the narrative \"aliens are bad\" is definitely one that might call for more military money, it's a short-term play. Revealing NHIs will, at some point, have a drastic paradigm shifting power. There won't necessarily be a need for military as we see them now. Probably even Governments. Definitely not the current economic system. That's why people who are not necessarily within the programs are fighting disclosure, their jobs are all about keeping the status quo.\n4. There have been serious reports from former military personnel working at nuclear launch bases who have reported several encounters with UAPs, and there are stories of how the first attempt of taking a nuclear missile into orbit was stopped by a UAP. Now, I speculate here, but I have a feeling they won't be able to put nuclear weapons in space. We'll see about that.",

Are they incompetent?\n\nA) non sequitur - the argument means that because a species is advanced, their technology cannot fail. This does not follow the premises. Technological advancement does not necessarily mean said technology is 100% fool proof from mishaps or crashes.\n\nB) Argument from ignorance - the argument assumes that all stars are billions of light years away, yet Infact there are a plethora of star systems with planets that are much much closer than Billions of light years. There are upwards of 75 stars within only 100 Light years from Earth! So this objection is concocted on lies, at least this part is. \n\nThe USA, most advanced military also sees losses to its most advanced jets. Lost F22s and F35. Even at low % of crashes per sorties, you will see accidents. If aliens are flying around all the time, it is inevitable their tech may fail, a pilot error may occur or they may encounter EMP that may cause certain malfunctions. To suggest alien craft are immune to crashes is logically incoherent. \n\nIf their crash rate is only 1%. That means for every 100 UFO missions 1 will crash. \n\nIf their crash rate is 0.5%, then for every 200 UFO sorties 1will crash. \n\nIf their crash rate is 0.1% then for every 1000 UFO missions, 1 will crash. \n\nNow imagine if they have been visiting us for centuries or thousands of years, and that there maybe different species with different degrees of technological advancement. Each species own sapcecrafts may also vary in their susceptibility to crashes, dependent on their technological advancement.\n\nEven our most advanced space vehicles experience crashes. Our space shuttles did 135 missions of which ONLY 2 CRASHED which yields a remarkably low crash rate of ~1.5%. But we all know & remember the crashes. \n\n\nWhy wouldn't theirs? Obviously it could.

What I guess is that they come here to repair their spaceships until they can fly again or communicate with their peeps on their home planet.",
                "Also, human intervention could play a role. \n\nIf we have any (secret) energy weapons that can affect their systems, 100% guarantee there's people actively trying to take down as many as possible",

                "Couple things to consider: Not only do they need to stay hidden from humans, but they also need to stay invisible to other aliens. So they might have to navigate on minimal equipment when near earth.\nAlso, I believe humans have the ability to track and scramble their navigation.",
                "We deliberately abandon probes on Mars after they've served their purpose. We crash things into Jupiter. Things have a shelf life.\n\nThat might seem counterintuitive in light of the claim that some probes are said to have \"pilots.\" We don't throw our pilots away, but they might. For all we know, the crafts are more sentient than the pilots\n\nI don't expect a hundred-million year old civilization to have failure rates comparable to ours or have failures that look like ours. I do expect them to have waste products.",
                "Because its so hard to get here.",
                "Because we shoot them down..",
                "Maybe they are suicidal and decide to end their life in a way that will let us know who they are.",
                "So a species that is extremely technologically advanced--so much so they can travel literal light years--is super interested in Earth? We would be amoeba level to such a species. And yet they travel light years on the regular to study us? Sounds like BS to me.\n\nI'd actually love for there to be actual proof of aliens, primarily so we could finally shut up all the religious nuts that claim \"their\" God created the universe. But until there is more evidence than shaky videos and \"eyewitness\" accounts that don't even close to conclusive proof, UAP's are just a fantasy IMO. If Grusch is correct and not FOS, then the definitive proof should be coming our way fairly soon. I won't be holding my breath.",
                "I've seen this in almost every YouTube video comment since the hearings and its driving me insane. You can't give them reasons why either because we'll you know how people are \"I'm right and your wrong\" or instant name calling",
                "The fact that you had to explain this to people is pretty sad",
                "I think the main issue is that we are not aware of what exactly makes up an exotic aviation vehicle. We are used to airplanes and such with riveting, and other components involved in manufacture. From what is gathered, both in testimony and thru eyewitness documentation, the exotic vehicles are one piece, no rivets or other similar manufacture techniques. In my mind and hopefully an engineer can chime in, its much less likely to malfunction ,from a structural viewpoint, if its one piece. Couple that with the rumors indicating that these vehicles are controlled thru a mental process ( meaning no onboard flight attachments such as a yoke) adds to less of a chance for malfunction. Obviously theres the propulsion aspect or engine , if you will, which I doubt we will ever hear the intricacies of, that has a chance of failing but if you look at the way its suppossedly built why would it seem as if the entire vehicle is built to counter any kind of malfunction and simply allow the propulsion system to be the achilles heel , if you will. Just doesnt add up to me. All this is just reasoning and assumption on my part. We can throw in the fact that if you are truly thousands of years more advanced you seriously should have been well schooled in where issues would occur with the vehicle, EMP, radiation , heat , cold, ballistic, energy damage etc basically anything a primitive society could contemplate to muster. So I would say , yes it seems rather odd that ufo's crash. There could be one solution to this tho that would tie it up with a pretty bow. Could it be possible that the USA has acquired other technology from other NHI that specifically are made for this? Kind of like land to air pulse? The only reason that I bring this up is because theres footage ( shot from space ) of a ship nearing Earth and a \"beam\" firing from Earth towards the ship. It misses the ship and the ship reverses and bugs out. That weapon could be our \"missing link\" as to how and why these objects crash.",
                "Well said, thank you. I too tire of seeing this perspective.",
                "Most people also still presume they actually traverse the vastness of deep space. According to those who supposedly have the info they pretty much don\u2019t. They fold space time and basically bring their destination to them (really layman explanation and probably not entirely correct lol). But that makes these UAPs more time machines than actual \u201cspacecraft\u201d as we tend to think of from Star Wars etc.",
                "If they really do 3D print AI brained bios and ships, maybe they are just disposable and they don\u2019t care what happens to them like us with a plastic cup",
                "The aliens could have also died in space, due to unforeseen circumstances. The craft is targeted towards Earth, and crashes once it reaches here.",
                "People seem the think that whatever this phenomenon is, is infallible. That they\u2019re so godlike, something so advanced can\u2019t have flaws. Everything has a weakness, right down to you and I. You can go out and buy a motorcycle right now. The majority of us did not engineer this machine, and yet you have access to it. People die on bikes all the time. I don\u2019t understand why people think because the tech is so advanced that accidents can\u2019t happen. We have safety ratings, airbags, all this tech to keep us safe in a vehicle in the modern day. So why do we keep dying in car crashes/road accidents? Y\u2019all are silly.",
                "Do you know the energy required to get to light speed? I\u2019m not saying someone infinitely more advanced than us could not figure it out. I\u2019m just saying. It takes a lot of energy.",
                "I think the obvious one is that some missions are meant to fail as well. Some things are expendable and not worth keeping at a certain point. We have no idea what that point is or what those criteria are.",

                "They absolutely fail to realize how many aliens that that means there are and how often they're flying around",
                "Asvanced doesnt mean perfect or gods \u2026 human planes are advanced compare to 200BCE ppl but yet they crash",
                "Depends on how advanced they are it might just be a game for them \u201chey I will give you 2 spaces buck if you can fly a ship without defend system around the earth and not get shot down by apes or crash \u201d",
                "Because however advanced they may be, predicting where a bolt of lighting will strike his hard. Like very hard. And a lot of energy too. Maybe they havent mastered lightning yet.. It took Prince Zuko like most of the series to get it right and he had a good teacher.",
                "If they are a sort of von neumann probe, like the type of probe that Robin Hanson hypothesizes in his \"grabby aliens\" paper, or able to simply wormhole anywhere in the universe (note, wormholes would appear as spheres, perhaps transparent, in 3d space), then they may be disposable; recycleable as an individual molecule in our body is recycleable. So the first few crash, are shot down, are jammed with massive building-size phased array radar systems, etc, are just learning cases -- latter ones constructed are modified to account for these contingencies.\n\nMore speculatively, perhaps they are responding to a call from our species asking for their help. It may be that they wish to respect our free will, and thus don't wish to simply mix with us, but simultaneously they don't wish to refuse a call for help in a situation which has high potential for bad outcomes. Thus, crashes, recoveries, etc. may also serve as a \n\nMore speculatively yet, our metaphysics could be entirely wrong. It may be that the entire universe is projected outward from our own minds, in a holographic fashion in which dimensionality is gained by the interference of multiple lower-dimensional processes."
