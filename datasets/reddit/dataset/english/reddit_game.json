So listening to public enemy and NWA lead interested me in rage\u2019s early sound. \n\nI found appreciation for the music over just the lyrics, started listening to a Norweigian(?) band called Children of Bodom and started skating and getting into thrash. I moved to the desert and started hanging around my cousins who were all greaser Mexicans who wore a lot of Lucky 13 gear. So I started listening to Dick Dale and dressing like American Me. \n\nMid high school, my style started shifting to wearing tighter pants, and skating in boots, and started listening to stuff like The Meteors, some Ska and folk-punk. New school saw me cut my hair into a mohawk, patch up a leather, and and go full punk. It was quite a journey.",

Now and then the main club on the Blvd would have a mid-week punk night of bands that really were into the new music - and were not bad .... considering there really was no road map.

Around the same time  i also fell in love with Linkin Park. \n\nWell, when i first got into school, we had music class once a week, and our teacher was a very... special person. Barely fit through the door yet always fat shaming kids, yelled at us if we (6-7 year olds) didn't get a song right on the first try, and in general was a total jerk. Sadly during that time i also lost any interest in music in general. She made me hate listening to music, i lost my biggest interest. \n\nSo, years later, after almost constant bullying, family feuds, being left out by both my family and classmates, struggling to find and keep friends, i searched for a healthy way to keep myself alive, and i found safety in music again. I started listening to more music than ever before in my life. I found my love for Linkin Park again first, and slowly dove first into nu-metal, and later into other, heavier metal subgenres. After a while i asked myself, what was this other band i always enjoyed so much. And with that i found green day again, and with that my love for it, i instantly listened to every album i could find, any live show i found footage of, but sadly, that era was short lived and i quickly went back to metal. Some time later, as i slowly worked my way up to enjoying death metal, i found out about grindcore. As i looked up well known bands, i saw that napalm death had a show near me soon, and it was surprisingly cheap (around 45 bucks) with 4 other bands also being there (Escuela Grind, Dropdead and Siberian Meatgrinder). I didn't wait long and quickly bought the tickets after checking that i could afford them. \n\nIt was my first concert ever, so i didn't now where the entrance to the concert hall was, and i asked a random person on the street that looked like he also was on his way there, where it might be. He was a member of a punk band from nearby, Flowers in Concrete, and showed me the entrance. After making sure i could find it again, i left it to get myself something to drink before the concert starts, since i arrived very early. And to my surprise, as i wanted to enter a supermarket, i saw Barney leave the exact supermarket i was about to enter, with a snack in his hands. I tried to talk to him, explain how much of a fan i was (since i listened to a lot of their music around that time) and he even shook my hand. \n\nAnyways, some time later the concert started, and Escuela Grind took the stage. Even though i did listen to them before the concert, the recorded version couldn't capture the power they had in a live setting. This was my first live contact with raw, agressive punk music, and i loved it. After the less positive set from Siberian Meatgrinder, Dropdead took the stage, which was when crust punk made itself comfortable in my list of music genres i love. During this set i got spat at by Bob Otis, their singer, kicked and hit into the kidneys by moshers, and almost passed out, but that felt like a part of the music at this point. Then, at around 11pm, Napalm Death took the stage. Sadly, since i live an hour away and had to catch the last train of the night, i was only able to stay for 10 more minutes, but those were the best 10 minutes of my life.\n\nThe next day, when i walked to school, and when i walked back home, i had non stop grindcore, crust punk, hxc and powerviolence blasting through my headphones. Ever since that day i started to religiously listen to all kinds of punk subgenres, in addition to metal, now to the point where not even goregrind, gorenoise and mincecore feel that brutal anymore, gothic rock, and, somehow, funk.\n\n\nsry for the long text lmao",

                "Didn't ESPN offer a deal that was basically the same as the Big 12s deal now even before they offered it to the Big 12? And the Pac 12 told ESPN to pound sand. \n\nESPN can be blamed for a lot but the collapse of the Pac 12 and WSU being screwed by it isn't ESPNs fault. It's the Pac 12s. And the Big 12s. and the Big 10.",

                "There seems to be all the blame on ESPN. The network made an offer equal to the Big XII deal, which probably would have kept the conference alive. The PAC turned down ESPN and went to the open market.\n\nFOX is the one over the B1G deal. They are the ones who are paying for and benefit from Oregon and Washington leaving. FOX and ESPN split the inventory from the Big XII. OU and Texas leaving for the SEC was big but it didn't change the landscape of college football. That was FOX.",
                "It sucks what's happening, but Washington State is still going to have a football program. Boise State, TCU, Cincinnati, UCF, etc. are all programs that got a lot of attention because they were really good G5 teams. I know it's a tall order for a program with WSU's track record, but if they can put a consistently good team on the field they're not going to be forgotten.",

                "People keep bringing up that the Pac-12 could've accepted that offer in here, but that offer was a low ball. It is for the Big 12 too. They ran to it for safety and it allowed them to outmaneuver the Pac-12 in hindsight so it looks great now, but there's no way you can tell me that either of those conferences are worth less than half of the B1G/SEC. ESPN/Fox definitely got a discount.",

                "My family has flown the WSU flag multiple times. It will keep flying when we're gone, and this will do nothing but strengthen their resolve. \n\nThe reason the WSU flag flies at every game day is that WSU 100% earned college gameday when they were undefeated late in the season with a home game against Washington (or somebody else, I forgot). However, ESPN didn't go to Pullman because going to Pullman was too difficult, which greatly angered the WSU fanbase. They sent a WSU flag to gameday in protest of getting ignored, and have been ever since.\n\nIt's a message from WSU to the world that it doesn't matter that the media ignores WSU and refuses to give them the respect they deserve, they'll show up all across the country no matter what, its impossible to ignore them",
                "How could ESPN let Fox, USC, UCLA, and Larry Scott blow up the Pac-12, when they knew that it would make one small element of a seasonal Saturday morning tv show feel a little weird?!?",

                "40 years ago ESPN was a neat concept and filled a much-needed void on early cable systems.  Now, ESPN is the most arrogant, self-important channel on TV, filled with obnoxious and opinionated personalities.  ESPN acts as they are entitled to have sports exactly as they want and BAH GAWD the country should be appreciative of their leadership.  F\\*ck ESPN.",
                "That\u2019s an easier cop-out than the teams who were more than willing to abandon their historic in-state rivals. \n\nLeave them out to dry and collect more revenue while becoming the premier power five conference in the region which will also benefit them for recruiting. \n\nYou know who they are.",
                "Why are people being so weird about this? Did you care when UConn, USF, and Cinncy got left in the cold when the Big East collapsed?",

                "It\u2019s like Mizzou in the SEC - not much of a purpose other than to suck up conference losses (and fictitious sanctions from r/CFB users) but you have to include them for completeness.  /s",

                "The blame squarely lies on the PAC-12 and the presidents of the universities shoulders. Not ESPN, Fox, Apple, whtaever. WSU, OSU, Cal, and Stanford are left holding the bag thanks to the greed of the PAC-12 teams and organization.",
                "someone got kicked out of the ivory tower and it shows.\n\nThe flag will still fly.",
                "If ESPN truly cared about College Gameday they wouldn\u2019t have fired David Pollack for douchebag Pat McAfee. \n\nIt\u2019s very clear that ESPN hopes that enough of us continue to have it on as tradition and that they can get the younger crowd and barstool crowd to start watching. And if not, I don\u2019t think CGD is a big priority for them in the grand scheme of things compared to all their other stuff.",
                "How is ESPN a guilty party?\n\nFor offering conferences money in exchange for media rights?\n\nAnyone remember a few decades ago when you were lucky to get a few of your games on television?\n\nWould you prefer to go back to that?\n\nI watched every single game in football and basketball that I wanted to this year. I thankful for espn for setting up the infrastructure for that type of convenience.",
                "ESPN doesn\u2019t care about anyone outside of the SEC",
                "This \"Oh woah is me, my school's athletics will no longer exist\" crap like being part of the Mountain West is a program death sentence is the exact elitist, arrogant attitude that caused the Pac-12 to die in the first place.",
                "I think the only solution is to make sure there are dozens of Wazzu flags during every gameday. Fans of other teams flying the cougar flag in solidarity in one of the only ways we could symbolically protest the way re-alignment is proceeding   \n\n\nWaving the bloody shirt, except its a Cougs flag",
                "I'll take all the downvotes but don't Oregon State and Washington State have a better chance of getting into the expanded playoff now? Winning the Mountain West is easier than the PAC12. Go win that, have a decent record and they'll be in.",
                "If they ever said they were gonns stop, I think CFB fans probably would help keep up the tradition. I know I would help out if at all possible, even though I can't travel nearly as much to games as I'd want to. But if College Game Day comes to Provo, or even up in Salt Lake or even Logan for USU, I'd probably do it if no one else could! May the Wazzu College Game Day Flag ever run high!!!",
                "As it has been, the flag will remind me Wazzu is around on non-apple cup weeks",
                "Wazzu will still exist. As will their fans.\n\nSure there are questions about where the team will end up as far as conference membership. But there's no reason the flag can't still fly.",
                "I hope they keep flying it. As college football continues to be losing some traditions/rivalries I'd hate to lose something like the Wazzu flag that has become a staple. It's a small detail but something that would be missed no doubt.",
                "As a WSU alum, please stop whining. Wazzu is in a difficult spot, but they aren't going to die. The flag will still fly, and wazzu will still find plenty of ways to coug it in the future, albeit probably against different opponents. Wazzu hasn't been a relevant \"part of the larger cfb scene\" in a long time. And that's fine too. Everything will be fine.",
                "Oh no Wazzu going to implode?",
                "Don't like Wazzu but love the flag guy and hate that they've been treated like second class",
                "Ok cry some more",
                "Pathetic if that\u2019s your legacy. If I were a Wazzu it would be more of an insult being remembered for something so ridiculous",
                "Oh lord what will college football be without a WSU flag on college gameday (which you haven't explained why that would stop...). Some P5 conference should add them immediately!",
                "I mean, I don't really care if they bring it, it's purpose was fulfilled, now it's just novelty.",

MJ was still one of the best guards/perimeter guys in the league at age 40.",

Pretty easy to name 10 guys above him, after that it gets murkier.\n\nThat being said, that was the wrong role for him at that stage of his career. He needed to be a 2nd option to a team with a clear 1, which obviously wasn\u2019t possible because of the front office aspect in Washington. But if he could have had a true star to pair with, he would have been a perfect running mate.",

The roster around him was dreadful unfortunately.\n\nGood question. It\u2019s kind of debatable if he was playing SG or SF with Rip and then later Stack in the lineup with him, but if considered a SG, I\u2019d say he was easily top 10 SG of 2000-09.\n\nKobe, TMac, AI, and Wade is my easy top 4.

Had Jordan and Hamilton both stayed healthy I honestly believe the Wizards might've won 48-50 games and made some noise in the playoffs on the back of a fucking 39 year old. Amazing.  \nThe Wizards went from having won 19 games the year before to a potential Playoff contender that was derailed by injuries with their offseason additions being:  \n38,5 year old Michael Jordan - ended up only playing 60 games and starting 53 due to injury\"",
                "The whole concept of load management sucks to me. It\u2019s a mentality we\u2019ve allowed to get more and more steam by not holding guys accountable and allowing teams to make their own standards for play time.

Interactive Entertainment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Interactive_Entertainment). Based on the [DC Comics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_Comics) superhero [Batman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman), it is the follow-up to the 2011 video game [*Batman: Arkham City*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman:_Arkham_City) and is the third main installment in the [*Batman: Arkham*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman:_Arkham) series. Written by [Corey May](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corey_May), Ryan Galletta, and [Dooma Wendschuh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dooma_Wendschuh), the game's main storyline is set eight years before 2009's [*Batman: Arkham Asylum*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman:_Arkham_Asylum) and follows a younger, less-refined Batman. When a bounty is placed on him by crime lord [Black Mask](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Mask_(comics)), drawing eight of the world's greatest assassins to [Gotham City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotham_City) on Christmas Eve, Batman must bring Black Mask to justice, while also being hunted by the police and having to face other villains, such as the [Joker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_(comics)) and [Anarky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarky), who take advantage of the chaos to launch their nefarious schemes.\n\nThe game is played from a [third-person perspective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_camera_system#Third-person_view), focusing on Batman's combat and stealth abilities, detective skills, and gadgets for combat and exploration. Batman can freely move around the [open world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_world) of Gotham City, interacting with characters and undertaking missions. Aside from the main story, Batman can help the police deal with crimes and confront other supervillains terrorizing the city. *Arkham Origins* introduces the ability for Batman to virtually recreate crimes, allowing him to investigate the scene and identify the culprit. The game is also the first in the series with a [multiplayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplayer) [mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_mode), in which players partake in a gang war between the Joker and [Bane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bane_(DC_Comics)).\n\nThe development of *Arkham Origins* began in 2011. WB Games Montr\u00e9al took over development duties from the series creator [Rocksteady Studios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocksteady_Studios), which was preoccupied with [*Batman: Arkham Knight*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman:_Arkham_Knight) and thus would not have been able to release a new game for a considerable time. The team chose to make the game a [prequel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prequel) to explore certain aspects of the Batman character, such as his vulnerability and lack of experience, that previous games could not; the story was inspired by the comics [*Batman: Legends of the Dark Knight*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman:_Legends_of_the_Dark_Knight) and \"[Batman: Year One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman:_Year_One)\", and was developed with input from writer [Geoff Johns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoff_Johns). Development of the multiplayer mode was handled by the British studio [Splash Damage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splash_Damage), separately from the main game.\n\n*Arkham Origins* was released worldwide on October 25, 2013 for the [PlayStation 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3), [Wii U](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii_U), [Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows), and [Xbox 360](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360). The game received a generally mixed reception, especially in comparison to the previous titles; it was praised for its voice acting, boss battles, storyline, visuals and score, but was criticized for its large amount technical issues and a general lack of innovation in gameplay mechanics, while the multiplayer aspect was considered an unnecessary addition to the series. A companion game, [*Batman: Arkham Origins Blackgate*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman:_Arkham_Origins_Blackgate), was released alongside *Arkham Origins* for the [Nintendo 3DS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_3DS) and [PlayStation Vita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Vita), and a spin-off [mobile game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman:_Arkham_Origins_(mobile)) for [iOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS) and [Android](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)) platforms was released in October 2013. An animated sequel, [*Batman: Assault on Arkham*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman:_Assault_on_Arkham), was released in 2014, and a successor video game, [*Batman: Arkham Knight*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman:_Arkham_Knight), was released in June 2015.\n\n##",

                "I like it great work so far! One thing that I feel would improve your lighting would be switch up the lights models and rework them a bit. For fluorescent lights with two tubes for instance, give them two light sources per light fixture, play with the color of them so they are slightly different, give them a flicker animation that is unique per light as well, expensive but it would help make it more convincing. Any place in the environment that is visibly an eye attraction point like crown mouldings and light switches, doors, windows etc should be prioritized in regards to model detail. Paying attention to these elements of your environment will greatly increase the believability of your environment. Adding subtle variations to repeating world elements also helps break up the \"video game\" look. I also apply this to texturing across my project so I use less repeating segments, Wallpaper might have 4 variations per tile set, use grime and grunge brushes to stamp around corners and edges etc.  Great work on the lighting overall. Chromatic aberration could be dialed back slightly.",

                "A lot of people have given compliments on this and i agree with all of them, so ill jump to ideas I had looking at the folder. Which first of all, the fact that I immediately had something brewing means you have a great piece of work so far. I'm going to give you basically professional feedback as if this was a project my peers were working on, terminology and all. (So if something doesn't make sense feel free to ask me)\n\nSo- For places in the backrooms to really hit you with that unsettling feeling, you gotta feel like you dont understand the layout and that it is way bigger than normal. Backrooms thrive on being both a normal setting, but they feel OFF, you know? You could add more environment objects in the world, but make them purposefully wrong sizes. maybe they are a little too small or a little too big. What matters about this is that its done with intention. Cause you don't want someone just assuming you messed up the sizes, so if another person says it looks goofy, just try again until you get a feel for it. Sometimes what seems obvious to the person designing, wont be obvious to the viewer. You being this young means you don't have the luxury of years of experience, but this also means you have the potential to build it way early. \n\nHave something in the room you need the player to focus on? Ill drop the concept of Visual Hierarchy here for you, which basically means which thing does your brain want to look at first. You can call attention to details that are important by manipulating their Heirarchy in a given space. \nExamples:\n-Literally just have the object in the middle of a large room, this is particularly good for backrooms.\n-Something that is larger almost always makes people look there first, brighter also does this. \n-Strange colors compared to the rest of the surroundings.\n-Off-Centered compared to the rest, or an object out of line with others.\n\nAll of these are ways to have a bunch of the same things in a room stay distinct from another, and can be applied to doorways and other spaces as well.\n\nThe last thing to bring up is on a larger scale, which is arriving at the atmosphere of infinity. Basically making everything look like it goes on forever. You can make a medium space feel more expansive by adding way more walls and corners than is needed, or contrast that by having a LOOOONG room tied to it. Doors to nowhere, some open to maybe just a large closet and others don't open at all but just them being there will make the brain think there is more to the space. Repetition of a room is also very good for Backrooms specifically, and can be a time-effective method of making that feeling of infinite rooms. Make sure however, that if you have a bunch of copies in a row that you do something to each one to make it not just exactly a copy of the previous room. Messing with direction can be enough. Say you enter from the south to room 1, and go out the exit at the north side. Then you have a short hall that turns to the left and leads to a repeated room. The door SHOULD be coming from the east side if this was normal 3-D space, but say you go through that door expecting to come out the east side but you walk into the room and it APPEARS to be from the south. This is a little abstract, but to pull this off just rotate the copied room 90 degrees and attach it to the hallway. \n\nOkay, I will leave this here and give ya time to read it. I am trying to give feedback that will both improve the game, but also make you try things to expand your skillset. So even if these things don't work out, just understanding them and trying to apply them will be handy. I'll have to double check this when i am free later, but I tried to use the terms that you can google search to see decent material about them for the level of creation you are currently working in.",
                "I like that you\u2019re using very contrasting locations. Not something I see often in backrooms games. Keep up the good work!",
                "This looks INSANE. Can't wait for this game already!   \nOne thing I think you should do is make level ! wider, but other than that, graphics are amazing.",
                "Looks good but level 0 looks a little green. Great job tho",
                "13 YEARS OLD!? Good job",
                "13 years old.\n\n\n\n\n13 YEARS OLD.\n\n\n\nHow.",
                "Ur rlly talented, this is so good",
                "As a 13 year old dev myself I\u2019ve never made anything this good I\u2019ve made crappy games and semi good looking games but never something like this bravo",
                "Quick look at your reddit history and you're definitely not 13. Why would you lie about something like that? Very odd my dude. Cool looking game though",
                "Kids these days don't cease to amaze me",
                "Forget being 13, this would be good for anyone. Your hard work is really pauing off\ud83d\udc4d That first image is top tier for these kinds of environments. \nAs for constructive criticism: the environments aren't graphically consistent yet in regards to level of detail in texture as well as lighting, you still have work to do but it's looks like it's going well. Your environments, namely the garage areas look way to similar to other people's games. You're going to need to do something with the gameplay if you want it to stand out, such as giving areas sharp contrasts between well lit to very dark. Really working on detail, size, and the jumbled nature would help it stand out to the more generic parking garage environments I've seen. The book store area is a little generic as well. Odd set pieces and occasional bits of nonsensical floor plan that you sometimes see in real buildings will help a lot.\nThe pool rooms look promising but with only the one image it's hard to give any feedback beyond \"pretty\".\nI would recommend a few big things for overall guiding principles. Firstly, try to avoid overly used backroom levels while also keeping to the lore of whichever levels you use. Second, remember the nature of the backrooms is to endlessly wander, walking sims work far better than puzzle games for keeping the flow. Thirdly, don't be afraid to reference existing liminal art work to help your environments or even go check out locations that might help you get the right vibe such as older department stores, underground city parking garages, etc (I know at 13 that might be a bit tricky but it's just food for thought while you design your maps). You may even want to try using Ai art to generate images you can use as reference. I'm personally opposed to Ai art for the most part but I think using it to create reference images is fine if you are making something unique from the actual generated image.\nI'm gonna be honest, looking at this I have a hard time believing that eother you made this or that you are actually 13 but assuming that's all true then consider it a compliment towards your hard work. Best of luck to you and congratulations for going after something you wanted to do!",

                "I mean, assuming that you're asking in good faith, the answer is that the act of making a helmet might take 20 minutes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe process that happens prior to that is where the time and effort is spent. It's not like armor devs just sit there making whatever they want, there is going to be a process that involves concept art and decision making to ensure that stuff is not only made well but made to be the correct theme and all that. Given that even unpopular armor in D2 tends to be fairly complicated aesthetically, and the vendor armor has to hit the sweet spot of being good enough to meet their standards, but not so interesting that it eclipses raid/seasonal armor and/or ornaments, I imagine this is a process that might only take a few dozen billed hours, but that takes a month or more to move through all it's various steps and approvals and reworks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's not that even that takes a lot of effort either, it's more that it's one more thing to keep track of in a sea of 10,000 moving parts and pieces. And in the end, in a meeting where they discuss priorities, it's probably not going to be as high up as other things.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith that said, I think that this area, and the pvp/gambit map issue is an area where they need to choose to hire the people they need to do that work. I know it's not as simple as throwing bodies at it, and that even if they hired those bodies a month ago we wouldn't see results for a while... it's still what they need to do. We can't keep going to expansion after expansion and not getting themed maps. There needs to be a task force for each expansion who's explicit job is to create at least two crucible maps and at least one gambit map that are thematically aligned with the expansion they launch with. And those maps need to combine with balance passes for those modes at a minimum.",

It doesn\u2019t seem like this type of armor design is used much in D2, which sucks cause it could be very useful for creating ritual playlist armor that doesn\u2019t require a ton of flashiness.\n\nTake these two helmets for example: https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/destiny/2/22/Illyrian_Type_2_Helm.jpg AND https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/destiny/4/45/Illyrian_Type_0_Helm.jpg\n\nIf you look closely you can see that they are effectively the same helmet but with a couple different pieces added to make it look completely unique.

What you're seeing is called a kitbash, which may result in a design but not a game ready model in the least. In games every polygon counts for optimisation and here you're getting a lot of unnecessary ones, it would require a lot of cleanup. There's also way too many UV maps and cuts right now, assuming each individual part has a UV map already (if not they still have to make one according to their standards). These are used for textures. \n\nTexturing is a whole different process and more complex than just slapping on a few textures, especially considering their shader system and how different materials react to certain shaders. Then implementing everything and testing to make sure the geometry deforms correctly according to the guardian movements etc. Then going back to fix things that don't work. Staying within certain parameters set by the game. And so, for Bungie, based on their recent priorities (which is money) if they're gonna invest all that time into making an armour set, it's not gonna be a free one.",

You really think people would be happy with that? The D1 armour sets for vanguard/crucible were all just very slight variations of the same model of armour I'm pretty sure. \n\nI can't believe we are at the height of D 1 copium that people think the armour we had then was better than now - when people say that they are talking about the RAID armour that looked better, not the vanguard/crucible stuff. Vanguard/Crucible has NEVER given armour that looked cool imo lmao. Except maybe the Titan for crucible during Destiny 2 year 1, that feather neck chest piece goes hard.",

It was also a bad input, so many times have I tried to advance and duck a projectile only to accidentally do a breakaway.\n\n- Fatal Blow is dumb. Really dumb. Giving a free, armoured super to everyone when they are at low health is stupid.\n\n- Krushing Blows aren\u2019t \u201chorrible\u201d but sort-of reward bad habits (example, throwing out an upper cut is relatively low risk due to push-back but can yield huge rewards) and aren\u2019t very balanced across the cast. Some characters have really good krushing blows while also having a good kit (example Geras) but then a character like Johnny (who is decent) has the most impeachable fatal blows. \n\n- Kustom Variations implementation was really awful. The base moveset for each character was very limited and barebones to compensate for the \u201ckustom\u201d moves that you could add. Often times most of the moves are bad, have no synergy with each other or the character itself and characters have one or two go-to-the-best variations. \n\n- Auto-regen bar was bad.

                "I made this as a reply to someone else, but I figured it's long enough to be an answer in-and-of itself. I think two of my biggest issues are the way fatal blows in MK11 are handled, dial-in strings, and how they interact with Fatal Blows.\n\nI think a big issue is just dial-in strings in general. They take little effort to get down, and canceling into a special move or two can easily produce 25% combos with like 20 minutes in practice. I hate to be that guy, but in other non-NRS 2D games like Street Fighter have it down with the idea that even a three button string takes practice to land reliably for new players. The issue here is not that Labbing for 20+ hours means 35-50 + % combos; it's that 1 hour of Labbing can produce 35-50+ % combos. \n\nPlayers SHOULD be rewarded for practicing, but MK and NRS games, in general, really don't take much practice to learn these combos. I use the <-LP, <-LP Amplified Rolling Thunder Mileena Ball, ->HK, ->LK, Command Grab string. I learned it slower than most. It was STILL only a little less than 1 hour to memorize what I needed to do and only 1 hour in practice to get the muscle memory to land it consistently. With Fatal Blow instead of the Command Grab, I deal 50-ish % damage. My slow-ass does this with little to no practice. \n\nEven with my poor fundementals, if I get my opponent to 65% health and he gets me to 20%, I can just start the string by hit confirming ->HK, ->LK instead of the punches, hit them with that overhead about 50% of the time (if I avoided the string for the earlier parts of the match) and then end my string with them at 15%. They went from dominating me to hanging on by a thread by making one oopsie and getting touched by an overhead. I did all this in one, easy to learn, combo.\n\nIn most SF titles, that kind of damage is reserved for the very dexterous and coordinated players, or players who spend TONS of playtime training in practice and learning the frame windows of each and every input in their strings. 50+% is special in most games. Hard - even. In NRS games, it's achieved by anyone willing to put 2-3 hours into practice. That's really crazy. \n\nMake Fatal Blows non-comboable, high risk/high reward whiff punishes- or make us just dry launch them. If they HAVE to be comboable, give us a hard combo or motion input that is needed to start them. Don't just let me mindlessly cancel half of the fatal blows to the end of my strings and let me tag them onto the end of my combos with the push of two buttons.\n\nEdit: 50+ % combos in non-NRS 2D games are also often achieved by people who have also just played a LOT of the series and, to an extent, the game.",

I'm not saying Jaylen is at Giannis' level but the whole season Jaylen had been smoking defenders and won All-Nba second team and he is still 26 yrs old. So much room to grow.

I'm finally to the spot with this game that I don't want to grind for stuff I have and get multiple times over. I only play video games for enjoyment, and D2 is no longer enjoyable for me.",
                "I was potentially curious about Marathon but after how they\u2019re fucking up the end of an 11 year franchise I\u2019m done. I\u2019ll play TLS, but after that I\u2019m done. I don\u2019t want to play any live service game they\u2019re involved with, which by extension means any of Sonys future live service stuff is going to be potentially infected by Bungie going forward.",

                "Again, none of this rage matters if your money makes it\u2019s way into Bungie\u2019s account. Businesses speak with money and time, not tweets and forum rants",
                "They say that they can\u2019t pool their resources to make more pvp maps because it takes from other areas. But the cool shit they say we can get hasnt even been good since zero hour. We havent had an actually good exotic mission in years. The secrets they say we can get arent cool or interesting, in fact i would RATHER them stop making exotic missions because half the time i play it once, think \u201cwow that was fucking terrible\u201d and then rarely ever play it again anyway. This game has taken a gigantic fucking nosedive.",
                "It really did nothing to get me back next season. Im so tired of the seasonal model being the same shtick every time. Im just playing other games hoping to get excited to jump back into destiny, but every time i boot it up, i just get bored.",
                "Paul Tassi said it best they aren't making money off pvp, or gambit so fuck those activities.",

Especially given that Silent Hill TikTok is indeed still a niche area of TikTok and not a reflection of the overall mainstream content lol ur just tryna gatekeep ppl who are already fans lmao that's why they are making niche SH and adjacent content in the first place. Additionally, given that the og SH games are hard to get ur hands and most ppl would have to go out of their way to look up some process then go and do said process in order to actually play the games, that alone is gonna keep ppl from having played the games but they can still very easily have watched walkthrough videos and video essays about the themes, etc. and become invested that way. I think being a fan that way isn't really any less valid and obviously those ppl won't be able to talk about the gameplay themselves and will probably focus their appreciation on other aspects of the game, such as the nice aesthetics.",

So instead of stances it would be based in weapons, 4 options:\n\nFists - which is what you would expect, boxer, gymnastics etc. Mainly counter based. High risk, high reward. With you being vulnerable but able to take down enemies quicker.\n\nBillie club (with cable) - larger range used for specific enemy types (although wouldn't be useless against any enemy). Could also be good at crowd control for multiple enemies. (Can also be thrown and zipped back used in many contexts such as stealth and combat, can choke people out, stun them or even zip towards them). \n\nTwo sticks or bastons - harder hitting, can break armour or blocking enemies (similar to weapon holders in Spider-man).\n\nEnvironmental weapons - pipes, bats, throwables like smaller objects like bricks and bottles. Ups damage and have a durability, best in early game but still useful in late game for high stun or combo building so takedowns can be performed.\n\nThe gameplay combat would be like sifu, blocking and countering, and with emphasis on combos leading up to take downs.\n\nEnemy types will vary from heavy, weapons users, ninjas and regular thugs, gun users etc.\n\n Stealth would play a part which something like Last of us. Listen mode an obvious inspiration but double down. Everything goes black but the outlines of walls and sound waves objects and enemies make, (ninjas wouldn't make much noise) also the sound the player makes with Daredevil. The more still a player is the deeper the the listen mode goes such as hearing heart beats and breathing (accounting for upgrades).\n\nTraversal would be similar to Assassin's Creed/ mirrors edge with it being pretty complex to free run as fast as possible. (Obviously with accessibility options). But with the Billie club and cable, it would be like \"Sekiro\" with pressing a button and zipping toward that lock on point, however can be chained to zip across Hell's Kitchen. \n\nMatt Murdock sections would play out in a similar way to \"Detroit: become human\" with many dialogue options with outcomes varying (maybe even multiple endings).  \n\nStory and villains, thinking punisher, The Hand and obviously Kingpin however how it would play out I'm not sure. Other villains obviously but can't think of them right now (maybe an original villain?)\n\nI could go into more depth, or am happy to hear others ideas.\n\nEDIT: Costumes and outfits of course... Basically all comic interpretations, yellow, the black mask outfit, the Netflix Daredevil options too. Some original ones would be cool too. Maybe even have Matt customisable with lawyer suit options, hair and beard options and the such. Maybe Glasses options too.",

                "You can simulate blindness through mechanics and echo location instead of a black screen. You cannot create a videogame about being blind, its obviously boring.\n\nBut you can create visual clues and sensor that allows you to see sound and movement while limiting your visual capacities. Like Batman Arkham detective mode but deeper. You could limit the percepction of your inmediate enviroment while having the power to smell and detect people's movement from kilometres away. You could temporaily sense enemies three rooms away or find out what they are actually saying to figure out their plans and surprise them. You could create investigation mechanics or stealth sections based on sound. Combat can be just similar to Arkham Games while using certain powers to figure out the direction of the attacks. I think the Neflixt show shows some  lot clues about how fighting could work. No need for black screens, it's all about adapting abilities to mechanics.",

So the prologue and story is lineair, but after finishing you'll get to freeroam with \"full\"-vision. Or maybe tbat invention is somewhat lazy screenwriting. \nBut it would be cool to first have an ability, understand what it is to lose, only to regain that ability. Normally superheroes get a power, need to understand it to wield it, then have some mental breakdown moment and then become stronger again. Yet Daredevil loses his human sight, not a superpower. So that could be an interesting thing in my opinion.",

Daredevil has superpowered senses and that's how the gameplay could be structured. It would be obviously in 3rd person and the whole environment would be visible to the player but enemies would be invisible. Here is where his sense would come into play, similar to listen mode in TLoU. Every action that the enemies make would make a sound that would make them appear on screen. How long they remain visible would depend on how loud the action was. This kind of gameplay would require well crafted and extremely detailed environment. So I think only dev teams that are master of level design could pull off a Daredevil game. Like Fromsoft for example.",

I say make it third person, and the ability to have two storylines. one for daredevil, and one more Matt Murdock. The MM life would be similar gameplay to LA Noire. and as for the DD gameplay, itll play exactly like Spider-Man. The game would be about 45 hrs long, side missions, open world activities, main missions, and collectibles including.

Games nowadays utilize solid motion capturing and improved animations so I like to get engrossed into the emotional details or even events around the characters--God of War, Spiderman, Horizon, and TLOU are prime examples that offer a lot of details during so many character interactions and dialogues.  So I like to have the HUD cleared up of \"noise\" not related to those moments and I rarely have issues personally with understanding and keeping up with dialogue during most sequences.  So no reason for me to have subtitles.\n\nEDIT -  love how I get downvoted for a completely subjective personal preference and I explain why lol.  Gotta love some people.  Whatever though....",

Plus, I feel like whenever I use the zonai builds it only gets me about 10 feet in air, so those were clearly out.  The only thing I do notice is the giant pillar that holds the castle in the air. !<\n\n Well, they have those in the depths, right? >!Those pillars that let you ascend to the surface? Maybe it\u2019s like that. So I jump down into the chasm. I though I made a mistake and I was about to fight a horrible villain (one shot a lynal with an ancient blade, unless that was somewhere else in the castle\u2019s ascent) except it keeps going and going and going. And by the time I realize what\u2019s happening I hear the ominous music and notice an unmistakable patch of gloom. !<\n\nOh Shit. I\u2019m about the fight Ganon. >! In the end, his army was tougher than he was, and he was only tough because I don\u2019t understand when to trigger flurry rush. The dragon battle was beautiful, even if I didn\u2019t fully understand what the hell was happening. !<\n\n\nMy questions: How was I supposed to get up there? and How much more story did I skip?",

I mean, strikes, crucible and gambit is what you\u2019re supposed to play when there\u2019s nothing else in the game to play. \n\nThey probably looked at their metrics, realized dungeon playtime drops precipitously after the first few weeks outside of some random master artifice farming. Whereas raids kind of don\u2019t lose that momentum. \n\nJust looking at LFG right now, there\u2019s a ton of groups for Root and VoG (obviously). And a bunch for DSC, Last Wish and even some for Garden. But looking at dungeon LFGs, outside of Ghost, they\u2019re all kind of ghost towns.",

In the same fucking encounter, meaning you're fighting yourself for drops or having to do the fun thing in an rpg type game and wait for resets of the guaranteed chance.\n\nHow they don't treat them exactly like mini raids I'll never understand. Get spoils at a slightly lower rate on 1st 3 runs, Buy the weapons from a chest at the end boss on Master only if you want it to be hard to get, or simply add a once a week lockout for guaranteed drop for spoils. Keep spikey armor rng as to incentivise continued runs.",

I get that raid weapons are usually top of the list, but dungeon weapons can and have been very far below them to where options in other areas like strikes are often better.\n\nNot sure what a middle ground can be though when a best-in-slot option will always be better than most other things.

If the answer from Bungie is \"we want to drive engagement - keep grinding\" then it's more likely to push folks away as the game continues to stagnate.\n\nFor folks that are tired of feeling obligated to get every pattern when a season drops, I would actually envision a system where there are no predefined patterns set by Bungie.\n\nIf the gun exists in the game its \"craftable\". Now this would be tied to a system where YOU the player decide what gun YOU want to craft and customize. You would do this similar to how titles work but for the activity type where the weapon drops. Fully completing X number of triumphs from those activities (in the vein of the exotic chance boosting triumphs from new dungeons & raids so expect some challenge here) gets you a craftable weapon of your choosing from that activity.

You can 4 pieces of loot per character per week in RoN, after that you have to go and farm encounters again to get spoils to buy weapons at the boss chest for 20 spoils (4 encounters). On top of that, you also have to get together a full team of 6 people who are communicating to do the raids. Now let's compare to GoTD. You can infinitely farm weapons from the encounters, you only need a team of 3, you don't even have to communicate, and the encounters are generally shorter.

Hell everything is a reskin nowadays. \n\nSo while I agree here, older dungeons will be on the back burner when they're already failing with the new content, as far as actual new models & weapons etc. \n\nHowever they absolutely could add at least a focusing option. The issue here is that they don't have it for any dungeons, so I assume that they don't want to add it.. this is probably because in their minds a dungeon isn't the same tier as a raid, and farming dungeon encounters is easier & faster than raids (even tho GOTD is slower than most raids we got on average lol) which is true in some ways. \n\nI don't get why duality got 2 craftable weapons, albeit abysmal drop rates at first (60 clears, had ONE red border drop) while spire and gotd got none. That is pretty lame and not to mention spire was all reskins basically. So they absolutely need to improve that. \n\nBut in the end id rather see new content get actual new weapons, instead of old.

                "This may be a little pessimistic, but I feel like Bungie doesn't want us running dungeons. They're improving raid rewards, but I feel like they barely want us running raids either.They want us running the same nightfalls and the same crucible maps back to back every week. They want to keep you in matchmaking, they don't need you running dungeons. They barely even have dungeon or raid bounties. \n\nThe last raid was pretty easy, sure. But it was fun. In my friend group, Root of Nightmares is the first raid since Leviathan that we were able to get a full raid party every week without having to use the fireteam finder. Because everyone was having fun with the raid, we were also running lots of dungeons. But, because RoN was \"too easy\", Bungie made the new dungeon real difficult, but not fun difficult. It's just boring. So now, nobody wants to run dungeons, and some of my friends gave up on the game entirely.\n\nDungeons are some of my favorite things to do. I don't have a lot of time to play each day, so I really only ever run one or two a week, and dungeons barely ever count for progress toward anything, so I basically have to choose between progression, or having fun with a friend or two in a dungeon.There have been a few times where I didn't read the requirements of a quest completely, and I'll be like \"oh, I can do this in a dungeon!\" Only to find that dungeons don't count.\n\nIt's the worst with dungeons for sure, but I find that there's little to no cohesiveness between all the different parts of the game, and that's a huge knock against it.\n\nEverything in destiny is kind of sectioned off and doesn't matter for any other parts. Vanguard stuff only matters for the vanguard playlist, gambit only matters for gambit, crucible for crucible, etc. Everything has its own seasonal progress, and dungeons are just kind of left out of everything.

                "Personally I find how Dungeons are now to be refreshing to the now norm crafting stuff cause, as a D1 vet, the loot is just how traditional destiny loot should be imho. Also some really good guns come from these Dungeons like the new Stasis wave frame and Rocket and from Duality the Smg, 3-round burst linear, and Stasis grenade launcher.\n\nHonestly the only thing I would want bungie to do is give Origin perks and refresh the perk pools of previous Dungeons (prophecy, GOW, Pit, and Shattered)",
                "Those reward changes were for in the future. So right now, dungeons ARE consistent with the rest of the game. Bungie also tends to give us information in parts so they ccan stretch it out.   \nIf the time comes and dungeons dont receive some sort of similar change, then I will agree with you. Until then, this thread is premature.",
                ">No one I play with wants to run dungeons after a few times or if they get the exotic and no one ever talks about going for weapon rolls because of how unreliable(and unfun) farming them are.\n\nThen you need better friends; Dungeons are like the most fun aspect of the endgame, the encounter design is better than most raids. Fuck, i think if you put RoN up against Ghosts, i think Ghosts wins handily for better structured encounters.  \n\n\nMaking the loot easier to get is not going to help dungeons, at most it'll hurt them, because, in the case you are describing, once everyone who gets their weapons then they'll just stop doing it. I'd rather be doing dungeons with folks that like the dungeons, than ones that don't and just want the loot.",
                "For context, I just joined Destiny when Season of the Splicer dropped. From there, I adapted quickly and became a lore nerd. Both lore-wise and gameplay-wise, they could bring back exotics through Dungeon\u2019s by just updating them. \n\nI.e, Grasp of Avarice would be perfect for this. It\u2019s a loot cave of exotics, which caused a fireteam to fight over each-other. Update Grasp of Avarice to have some new locations for chances to get other exotic weapons from D1. \n\nFor Shattered Throne (my favorite, even though I fucking hate the limited visibility), we could get more than just Wish-Ender as a secret exotic reward. \n\u2014\nOr, have a cycle like Warframe\u2019s Riven Mods where the more a single activity is done, the less the drops are temporarily and others are raised.",
                "How about, like, a knockout system first. After countless GotD and RoN runs, I still don\u2019t have full armor sets for any of my characters.",
                "I think storm chaser was by far my most used dungeon weapon, and I never managed to get both perks I wanted on a single gun. At least lfr's are meh now so I don't really need to worry about it anymore.\n\nIf I could get a single roll of my choice from any dungeon, it would probably be lingering dread with smart drift control, disorienting + spike grenade, auto loading and chill clip. I feel like I would use that any time I have a heavy or energy exotic on.\n\nI wish they would rethink being able to craft dungeon weapons.",
                "Shattered Throne doesn't even have fucking rally banner points, it's criminal how neglected some dungeons have been",
                "Because they saying they'll improve the game that's their marketing campaign.\n\n*We'll do the changes you want*, conveniently we're announcing that a little bit before we release next expansion trailer and start the pre orders.\n\nCheck last year calendar and what they said, it's always the same type of thing.",
                "So, I haven't read through responses so idk if any of this is redundant, but my thoughts are:\n\nProphecy's old loot pool is now world drops or unobtainable, with the newer loot pool being select Trials of the Nine weapons and the armor is meh.\n\nShattered Throne and Pit both share a loot pool with the associated locations events (meaning Blind Well and Altars respectively).\nShattered throne's weapons can have certain perks you can't get on them through Blind Wells though, but still. (To my knowledge).\n\nGrasp's weapons seem like they were PvP focused D1 throwbacks, so they didn't want to overflow the sandbox with godrolls there.\n\nDuality introduced some weapons that, if craftable, would power creep the hell out of PvE.\n\nSpire shares almost half of it's weapon loot pool with world loot now.\n\nGhosts has weapons that, if crafted, may present power creep issues in PvE and issues in PvP. (Enhanced Target lock on the smg wouldn't be balanced, even after nerf).\n\nWhile I agree the dungeon's current loot style is annoying, the accessibility is part of Destiny. Just a lot of grinding; Time sinks galore. Plus the update they did for the exotics really angers me because I have everything done for the boosts for Heartshadow, but post update, only have a plus one to my exotic chance because they were done before the change.\n\nTldr: Half the dungeons loot isn't worth it as you can either obtain it other ways or is outweighed by better options. The other half would likely cause power creep in PvE or problems in the pvp sandbox due to over access. It would be amazing, but it's done for a reason. The exotic change should have included boosts for exotics that were completed retroactively to the change."

Alternatively, show the catcher partly in the way. \n\n2) Add different modes, like \"Accuracy Only,\" \"Fewest Challenges,\" etc.\n\n3) Add extra difficulty levels, where the speed is faster, breaking balls break harder and right at the end, etc. Maybe like Little League (can't use their name obviously), High School, College, Minors, Majors.",

                "Excellent. Other improvements:\n\n1. Default over the top view is too high. Drop it a little bit as the angle is off for how we actually see the ball come in to the catcher.\n\n\n2. Back away from the plate a bit too. Plate umpires stand above the catcher's helmet and sometimes the catcher will get in the way, the camera is too close to the plate right now. EDIT: Played it again. You need to show at least three quarters of the plate. The view is simply way too close and prevents an accurate read of where the ball crosses the plate and, most importantly, the height of the ball in the zone.\n\n\n3. The slot camera view is too low. We go into the slot to get a, mostly, unobstructed view of the inside zone, but we stay at the same height as directly behind the plate.\n\n\nEDIT: 4. Remember that it's a strike ZONE, not a strike plane. The zone is a three-dimensional space occupying the space above the plate from the letters to the knees.\n\n\nPost this over at r/Umpire for more umpire specific reviews!",

                "This is a great concept and already a fun game! With that said, I think there\u2019s some improvements that could really take this game over the top:\n\n- different pitches is a key part of what makes umpiring challenging, it would be great to see some curveballs and two-seamers to add some spice. \n\n- rather than what seems like a random distribution of strikes and balls, using real MLB data on count-based in-zone% would make the situations feel more real. \n\n- you gotta add batted balls in here, even if it\u2019s just a swing animation with the outcome in text. This goes hand-in-hand with the second point because not all strikes and balls are created equal. Giving a hitter a free ball in a 1-1 count matters a lot more than in a 2-1 count. Playing the percentages and \u201cchoosing your spot\u201d to blow a call is really exciting element missing right now. \n\n-the power-ups are very cool!

There would be no reason for a catcher to try and frame a ball over a strike (that I'm aware of).\n\nEDIT: I'm realizing now that the ball is continuing to fall and the glove is showing where the catcher would make contact, but this is difficult to convey as a static 2D image (the glove) on top of a fully 3D environment.

I am not a developer in any way, so I don't know the difficulty of doing any of this, just calling 'em like I see 'em.\n\n-Home plate orientation, which has been pointed out. \n\n-Right-handed batters, and left-handed pitchers.\n\n-Batters swinging. Even if it's a thing where they never really make contact or everything is a foul ball, just so you get the bat going over the zone like the glove with the catcher framing. That way, kind of like the challenge, you can get the batter asking if that would have been a strike. This could affect integrity or make the batter more or less likely to challenge. \n\n-Height variance for the batters. One of the unique things about baseball and the difficulty of calling behind the plate is that the strike zone isn't static, it varies with each hitter. \n\n-I like the strike zone box and the accuracy, but in addition to that I'd like to see an effective strike zone with percentages for accuracy within the strike zone that you establish. A comparison of the two would be cool to see as well. \n\n-A difficulty slider (something like A, AA, AAA, Pro Ball) where the speeds vary and get faster and the break on the pitches gets more dramatic and deeper.\n\n-Understandably, the hardest thing to see are pitches low. Maybe it's the backwards home plate, but I found it really difficult to even identify that some of the low pitches were low. Not sure what a solution for this is or why it's so hard to see.\n\nIt's still fun as is, and I've always thought an Ump Mode in the bigger games would be really interesting. I have a few people I'm going to send this to who feel the same. There's definitely at least a niche that will very much enjoy this.",

Perhaps under the table $$ for making an outcome happen, which can be used as in game currency for power ups. \n\nNot only an overall integrity meter, but another gauge showing which team you're favoring (like ump scorecards). Like a bar gauge, and the goal is to stay in the middle (representing being impartial) but each incorrect call moves the meter slightly left or right, showing favor to a team. \n\nPlus badges/ranks/ongoing achievements. \n\nExample difficult scenario: home team must win but overall favor must be positive for visiting team. \n\nThis is fun.

                "LNG going to Worlds! What a year from Scout he has been so good this year... this team has a high ceiling hopefully they show up at Worlds\n\n\nI doubt EDG makes worlds even if Meiko suddenly decides to play like a human",
                "Elk about to pull a Leave on meiko during asian games",
                "So excited to see this GALA at Worlds!",
                "Ale is so cursed man. Man goes god mode every regionals just to see his team crumble",
                "What an absolute stomp but my guy god Meiko was a serial inter this series and he got picked for Asian Games.",
                "Welcome back to RNG, GALA",
                "JDG BLG LNG looks absolutely terrifying for everyone lmao",
                "Oh my beloved LNG, why couldn't you just pick Azir Xayah yesterday..",
                "Everyone outside of Ale with a massive stinker",
                "6 BO5's later LNG E-sports will make their second appearance at worlds.",
                "GALA is my daddy",
                "After 6 BO5, LNG finally qualify for Worlds. At least LNG didn't suffer the same fate as WE who gone through 6 BO5 in Summer 2021 Summer play-off and yet still not qualify for Worlds.",
                "Meiko at Asian Games is gonna be fun af, bro is a serial inter",
                "Nahhhh man I don't want to see anyone else getting blamed for that last game other than Meiko, he completely fking griefed the entire game. WHYYY WOULD YOU BASE THERE???? AND WHYYYYY WOULD YOU GO IN. Yes EDG inted later but it was all desperation plays cause Meiko completely fked the game, and they actually made good plays top side and could have won this game with Ale carrying without that shitty play bot",
                "Its depressing seeing good supports lose form and start to int. \n\nThey pretty much never recover once it gets this bad.",
                "thank god LNG kept it together after yesterday  \nwhat a beyond stupidy to have to play the next day again",
                "I like Uzi as much as the next guy but them going to Worlds in this form will be a great travesty. \n\nAlso, I can\u2019t decide if I want Wayward, TheShy, or FoFo to go to Worlds\u2026",
                "Gala is in insane fucking form right now, if scout and him can keep playing like this lng are scary",
                "Thank God EDG lost here.  They really don't deserve to go to worlds. Meiko Jiejie and Fofo are all trolls, and Uzi is not back in form yet. Please WBG/TES do not throw",
                "The bot gap is unplayable",
                "I\u2019d be shocked if the winner of TES/WBG doesn\u2019t go to worlds looking at EDG this series, Ale would need to do some 1v9 magic to make it happen but considering that he\u2019s playing into Wayward/TheShy he prob would have the chance to do just that",
                "Disasterclass by Meiko.",
                "Thank god LNG didn't suffer like WE 2021 (Worlds spot reserver)",
                "Crazy to think all the former Griffin squad could potentially make it to Worlds 2023. Tarzan (LNG) qualify. Lehends (KT), Doran and Chovy (GEN-G) are in 1st and 2nd place in LCK respectively and are hot favourites to qualify for Worlds.",
                "GALA sent UZI back to retirement",
                "There\u2019s frauds in every 3 lasting teams",
                "Congrats LNG on making it to Worlds as 3rd Seed, Well Deserved! LNG's form was just too much for EDG. Happy to see Scout and Gala at Worlds!",
                "Arguably the 3 best teams in the world qualified for Worlds, now all we need is an LPL team who will go 0-6 in groups.",
                "I would not be surprised to see LNG win Worlds although JDG are still favored and I have faith in KT\n\nScout top 3 mid, Tarzan top 5 jg, GALA top 5 adc. And Zika man how is this guy randomly so good?",
                "All the jiejie fofo haters who have been typing during this split have to understand that jiejie fofo looks bad majorly cause Meiko somehow finds a way to int and it was visible today as well,so much hate on fofo when his jayce games were the reason why they made playoffs in both splits",
                "rewatch this series and drink a shot every time the caster says kitty.",
                "Damn! That was the craziest early game i've seen in a long time, super sad that EDG couldn't close out the comeback. Getting caught at baron there was pretty criminal, the mental pressure caught up with them there. \n\nCongrats to LNG, deserved 3rd worlds spot for them.",
                "That lpl trio is scary they are so close",
                "Happy for Scout and the boys, much deserved worlds spot after insane year so far. Gotta hope TES can snatch the 4th seed for worlds now",
                "LPL firing on all cylinders this year, top 3 teams are so well rounded and it's gonna be a bloodbath for the wild card 4th seed (hoping TES make it)",
                "Congrats to LNG. It will be awesome to track their progress in Worlds",
                "GALA just build different.",
                "Gala outperformed Uzi last game. LNG, being this good, gives LPL more chances to win workers. Hopefully, 2022 doesn't repeat itself.\nI personally want LPL in the finals",
                "Looking back, it's really insane how RNG got Gala just a while after Uzi was gone",
                "I'm just gonna say it like this: This EDG doesn't deserve to be in Worlds this year. LPL's 4th team should be TES or WBG. Even if both have giant inters on top and shaky performances, they are still gonna look better on the biggest stage of the game.\n\nAlso congrats to Ruler and Kanavi on getting out of army in advance, should they actually send Meiko to AG",
                "How Meiko still have spot for Asian Games?",
                "Deserved W for LNG.\n\n\n\nMan EDG didnt play particularly bad, but the obsession of picking Tristana and the fact they tried to draft TANKS for fkin Ale kinda sealed their fates tbh. Poor old man Uzi, he had it coming for him though with that stupid build and tbh LNG is just on another level atm, they would surely beat even BLG if they play rn and are certainly the REAL LPL second seed.",
                "I'm so happy for Gala and Scout. Zika stepped up so big.\n\nHonestly, LNG look very strong might be the strongest coming to worlds with JDG.\n\nStill what a pity that they lost against JDG in finals in game 5, was definitely winnable if they drafted correctly lol. \n\nFirst seed was definitely in their reaches, seeing Azir from Scout and Xayah from Gala, they should just have picked that in blue side first pick instead of Jayce and then that audacious draft with Lillia jungle against full tanks + Xayah team lol.",
                "EDG fans knew this game wasnt gonna happen I was already looking forward to 4th seed before this game even happened",
                "I am not even EDG fans and I am disgusted their performance. Get Meiko out of this team.",
                "Man, feel for the casters over the last two days - production has done them dirty with messing up compression and gain consistently.\n\nGuess that\u2019s part and parcel of being a secondary broadcast who aren\u2019t in studio/arena normally, but definitely makes their lives harder. \n\nStill, much love to the casting team. Enjoyed the show over last two days regardless!",
                "G A L A > some fraud",
                "The disband EDG spam on the chinese stream is kinda funny ngl.",
                "Does this mean LNG is qualified for Worlds?",
                "Zika's and Hang's first time at Worlds. Tarzan, Scout (2021 World Champion), and Gala returning!",
                "Pure bot gap this series. LNG truly deserves this worlds spot, great performances from all the members and especially Scout through out the year. Another worlds, another chance for GALA to show he's the best on the international stage as well. Jiayou LNG!",
                "So happy LNG won and we get to see them on the world's stage! They can take home the championship.",
                "Have to feel bad for Uzi right now, it's kinda unfair for him tbh. When he's fed or at least equalizing the other adc, someone will fuck up his chance of winning. When he fucks up ? No one in this roster can save him. It's actually incredible how Meiko falls from being one of the best support players to a random Platinum guy who unluckily queues into the support role, and FoFo is at best a slightly above average midlaner who is completely incapable of carrying the team without Jayce in his hand. Their teamfight executions are also incredibly sus. What the fuck was Meiko thinking in G1 with that Alistar int ? Why the fuck did FoFo jump into the only bad side to jump into in that G3 last combat ? Uzi is clearly a tier below the likes of Gala or Ruler rn, but having a support who's as shitty as Meiko right now to go laning with is just unfair to Uzi, and to the other players in the team. And Jiejie, however good his decision making in teamfight is, it is not normal to provide less vision than your adc when you're playing jungle.",
                "Meiko is terrible. Good luck Elk in Asian Games. And man why Uzi is ruining his legacy?",

                "I have nothing wrong with demos in general, but I do find it quite annoying when that is someone\u2019s sole purpose for the entirety of a match. I\u2019ve had teammates in 3v3 where one literally demo chases the entire match and doesn\u2019t do anything else (unless it\u2019s their turn for kickoff). I find that far less valuable than e.g. a teammate who makes themself useful in multiple ways, beyond the single utility of chasing people for demos.\n\nTLDR: people that don\u2019t play the game and just demo chase are borderline match throwers IMHO.",

                "Im a bit of a demo guy (usually get between 3-8 demos per game). Even if you go for more demos than most players, you gotta know when, and how to do it. As other people said, it\u2019s easier to play this way if you have regular teammates. \n\nIn 3s it\u2019s completely crucial that the 3rd guy understands what you are doing. When you start to go for the demo, they should be advancing to take the shot, cause you aren\u2019t gonna take it. If they don\u2019t, you just wasted a play. Not only that, but the next step is probably a 3:1 counter attack, with your teammate possibly confused and out of position. Also you should go back immediately after the demo, fastest as you can, while being aware of how the play is developing, cause it\u2019s very possible that you have to defend fast, or even trying to cut the play short and intercept the ball instead of going all the way back.\n\nIt\u2019s a very risky style of play, and there\u2019s a lot of things you have to take into account to do it effectively.",

                "I find it funny because 95% of the time I\u2019m better at dodging than they are at demoing. The other 5% is annoying but I can respect it. Only exception is when they are clearly smurfing and just trying to ruin the game",

It\u2019s literally built into the game. There\u2019s an animation and everything lol. How in an 8 year old game are people still shocked when they get demoed and take it personally. Literally half of the time, people demo at the wrong time and I\u2019m back in my half with boost.",

I honestly feel it takes skill to get 60 in one match. I got annoyed at a Smurf team one game and decided to drill them because being pummelled in goal helplessly didn\u2019t seem like a fun time. \n\nWe actually turned the tide and won the game because I kept that little shit grounded. \n\nIt\u2019s not easy to make the hit in a fast paced game and after the first 5 demos, they\u2019re looking out for you and it\u2019s more of a challenge. So kudos to you. \n\nPerhaps if I have one suggestion is that the player being demo\u2019d repeatedly should have a \u201cgrace\u201d period of a few seconds after they spawn so they can\u2019t be demo camped. To prevent toxic demos and harassment. \n\nYou know like in some fighting games when you respawn you\u2019re still a ghost figure and invulnerable. \n\nI\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s real or not but that game I went demo crazy, I couldn\u2019t **boom** some of them even though I hit them with all my force.

                "Demo chasing in regular gamemodes is fair play. Boost is limited and using it smartly to demo is risky and rewarding. But in casual LTMs with infinite boost, it's very annoying. The point of the gamemode is zooming around the field at mach speeds hitting the ball hard and watching it fly around at the speed of sound. Using the boost to demo chase sucks the fun out of the gamemode imo. Would be nice if demos are turned off in certain gamemodes like this but it's not so oh well."

                "Quick, someone see if Rob McElhenney and Ryan Reynolds like baseball.",
                "Im with it. Sell the team.",
                "I heard a small chant during the 5th but FOX did a dugout interview at the same time.",
                "Sell the Manfred. I stand with Baseball.",
                "Ownership wants to leave and yet, this is what the Oakland faithful is capable of. Why would you leave such dedicated fans? Breaks my heart.",
                "Did people stand?",
                "I missed the top of the 5th. Could you hear it on the broadcast?",
                "Yeah, sell the team! Sell the Athletics, too!",
                "Sell the team",
                "this is what the reddit mods swore they were doing lol",
                "I have nothing but the greatest respect for how hard A\u2019s fans are trying despite the reality that the A\u2019s are leaving after game 162.",
                "KEEP THE A's IN OAKLAND! SELL THE TEAM.",
                "Wouldn't anyone who bought the A's just do the same and move to Vegas? I'm sort of ignorant to all the Oakland/MLB dynamics.  But it seems like the path of least resistance if you're buying a team and treating it like an investment. Correct me if I'm wrong.",
                "Who the fuck goes to Vegas to watch baseball. That\u2019s the last thing people want to do, and I doubt the local fan base would be willing to pay the presumably expensive ticket prices",
                "Oakland fans deserve everyone\u2019s support",
                "Top of the 5th inning has arrived. It\u2019s go time ASG fans!",
                "Not to rain on parades..... He's owned the team since 2005. Seven playoff appearances,countless proposals for a new stadium to replace the run down field they have now. 10 years ago it was leaking shit. Oakland has needed to move for damn near a decade and it's only in recent years that Vegas has become the target.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe owner is an asshole,but Oakland's politicians have done no favors either. There's plenty of blame to go around.",
                "I think it\u2019s too late",
                "I mean in all honesty their best attempt to show the world what they could do netted like 27k fans or, as Manfred kind of dug, a night of average attendance compared to the rest of baseball. Even the one night where Oakland fans were supposed to rally, they barely showed up. I think it\u2019s horrible what John Fisher has done and I\u2019m a firm believer that he\u2019s getting rewarded for being the worst owner in all of sports but this move is needed. Hopefully the Rays will be next",
                "Would be cool if they became publicly owned like the Green Bay Packers",
                "The teams moving. It\u2019s about as much support as people had for the Reddit blackouts",
                "As a baseball fan in Vegas would love for a team to move here\u2026 go ahead and down vote me if you want, but the move while might be disappointing to some the possibility excites others.  I get the ownership is a shit show\u2026 no matter what those players deserve better.",
                "Not very effective this time",
                "Sounds more like a eulogy than a protest\u2026",
                "Move the team finally I feel so bad that\u2019s it\u2019s in a town that doesn\u2019t support it",
                "I wish they didn\u2019t have to go to Vegas I\u2019d rather another sports town get a shot.",
                "I mean if they were supporting the team from the jump maybe this isn\u2019t a thing\u2026. Just saying",
                "I\u2019m honestly confused, can someone explain? They want the owners to sell the team, but selling it/moving it to Vegas isn\u2019t the same thing? Just genuinely asking. Hockey fan here haha",
                "If A\u2019s fans actually showed up to the game then there wouldn\u2019t be a issue in the first place",
                "If A\u2019s fans went to the games, the team wouldn\u2019t be always demanding a move\u2026",
                "Oakland lost all its sport franchises. It sucks to say but teams are going to go where they can make the most money. The fanbase is very passionate but it\u2019s too small.",
                "Please dont sell the team we need you to keep farming my beloved Braves!",
                "The team started in Philly, then moved to Kansas City then moved to Oakland. If there\u2019s one team that\u2019s gonna move, it\u2019s the Athletics.",
                "A\u2019s fans are just sad larpers at this point. Imagine wasting your money on this.",
                "Why is there so much support to keep them in Oakland? It\u2019s been a dud there for 30 years. It\u2019s a failed market for a second team and it\u2019s been an obvious conclusion to move them for years. I just don\u2019t get all this excitement this year now that it\u2019s too late.",
                "They should have brought themselves to more A's games",
                "Where were all these As fan when the team had home attendance at or near the bottom of the league for most, if not all, of my adult life?",
                "man this is so sad at least the failed reddit protest was only 2 days",
                "The Warriors left that area too and moved outside the city. There has to be a reason why. Never been there or San Francisco. \u201cI\u2019m a 49ers Fan\u201d 49ers moved away from the city as well. Are the reports of all the crime,drugs,and homelessness true?",
                "Lol stand up for cancer became stand up for **\"SELL THE TEAM!\"**",
                "Lol maybe if they showed up to their own games, we could take the A's fans seriously",
                "Maybe more than 5 people should actually gone to games in Oakland.",
                "Pointless",
                "Or the could go to the games. I mean they did a reverse protest??? If that many people should up to most of the games then they wouldn\u2019t be losing their team",
                "It's a bummer, but these guys need to realize it's over.",
                "Christ. Things will be better when they just move to Vegas already. This is getting annoying",
                "[deleted]",
                "yiiikkes",
                "It\u2019s over Oakland. Cash rules all.",
                "[deleted]",
                "Can someone explain why \"SELL THE TEAM\" became the slogan behind this movement if the intent is to keep the team in Oakland? I feel like I'm missing something.",
                "Relocation is so brutal. If you were a fan of a team that relocated, it\u2019s like part of your identity is ripped away from you. I wish it on no fan.",
                "Someone catch me up to speed on this?",
                "good for them!",
                "Am I tripping or does this make no sense and is this a decoy to sell sucker A\u2019s fans into tickets? Why would they say sell the team? If they want the to stay?",
                "Please do more of this. Getting these cards to as many games as possible would be great. \n\nLike, all it takes is one visiting A's fan at each game, or even a willing non-A's fan to put out a bunch of cards.",
                "They need to do a better job marketing this \u201csell the team thing\u201d until I read this I thought sell the team = move to Vegas.\nNot stay in Oakland which I can get on board with.",
                "Did this happen? I don't remember hearing it on my tv.",
                "Are people delusional enough to think this will do anything? Fisher is not selling, MLB is not going to force him to sell because of this, nothing will happen.",
                "Sell the team",
                "Why didn\u2019t they go to the games? If they went to the games the team wouldn\u2019t be moving. What is with this performative outrage?\n\nOakland made their decision on supporting the team a long time ago. Now it\u2019s ownerships fault for these \u201cfans\u201d not going to games for how many years?",
                "I was at the A\u2019s game on July 2nd and a group of literally children started chanting sell the team.  It was adorable and sad at the same time \ud83e\udd72",
                "Did this happen?  I\u2019d love to see video of it.",
                "Yeah. I'm going to need a PSA grade on this card.",
                "As are the most moved team",
                "This reloacation reminds me a lot about the Browns move to Baltimore\u2026 just fucking brutal and ugly all around. All relocations are messy but this one in particular is a disaster."

We're on the 9th generation of consoles 30 fps is not the standard, but the resolution mode option you see in most games, 90% of the time runs at 30 fps and it feels absolutely nauseating, it feels like you are drunk. It's completely unoptimized and I don't know why they include a resolution mode in the first place cause there's little difference on how nice it looks, the cons outweigh the pros heavily. You can see how some devs have to lock their fps to 30 at the last minute and it definitely shows. It creates the idea that 30 fps is absolutely unplayable but it's clear that the people who say this don't regularly revisit older titles such as Arkham knight to see that 30 fps can be smooth if the game is given tlc.\n\nThat said, let's hope starfield made the decision to lock 30 fps early in development and designed the game around this framerate or else it's going to be a mess.",

                "I love my 360, but I played so much Super Smash Bros: Brawl on Wii.",
                "Depends on what game titles you hold dear... for some its Nintendo for some its playstation and even people that eat glue have their favorites",
                "PS3",
                "I would say the 360 in the PS3 of her neck and neck.",
                "anybody who says PS3 is trolling because PlayStation kinda fell off around the PS3 era before picking back up hard for PS4",
                "PS3.\n\nI actually started that generation with a 360 and then a Wii. And Imma have to give credit to both. Mario Galaxy is one of my favorite games of all time, The Last Story became one of my favorite RPGs, and Xenoblade was legendary. Not to mention Metroid Prime and Tenkaichin3 on the thing. \n\n360 didn't slouch either... until 2010. Halo 3 is STILL one of my favorite FPS games, Gears of War was a nice treat and it introduced the world to Mass Effect. That was also back when Call of Duty was fun.\n\nBut the PS3? My favorite game to this day is Ratchet and Clank Crack in Time. Another all time favorite was Uncharted 2. Infamous 1 and 2 paved the way for GOOD superhero games, Metal Gear Solid 4 was also a treat for MGS fans. the Fuckin Last of Us? Not my favorite but I will ask anyone to shut the hell up if they think that game isn't at least great. Fuckin Yakuza? Yeah 3 was butchered on the system Stateswide but 4 was a great time and 5 is another one of my favorite games of all time. Also where the Soulsborne genre got its start! Also had a huge kick with Resistance too but I understand why Gears kicked its ass at the start of the gen. \n\nHere's the thing; I bought my PS3 months before the PS4 came out. Mfs on facebook were like \"hurrnwhy didn't you get a PS4?\" Because my PS3 kept me busy the next couple of years until I got a PS4 in 2016.",
                "Well I can tell you it's certainly not the Wii. That POS shouldn't even be in the discussion. PS3 BY FAR",
                "360 by far for me.",
                "PS3 definitely. Uncharted 1-3, The Last of Us, Shadow of the Colossus HD, Journey, plus access to some of my favorite 3rd party games like Skyrim, Fallout 3, etc. Also backwards compatibility with the PS1 which was a big deal for me. \n\nI don't know why PS3 always got so much hate, I have amazing memories of that console.",
                "PS2 > GameCube > OG XBOX\n\nXBOX360 > PS3 > Wii\n\nPS4 > Switch > XBONE > WiiU\n\nPS5 > XBSX (so far)",
                "Ahh, gen 7. The only gen where I pick Xbox over PlayStation.",
                "This is probably my least favorite generation of consoles, but I guess I'll go with the Wii because it had Twilight Princess and the Super Mario Galaxy games.",
                "Xbox 360.\n\nWii was cool and did have tons of games. But there weren't many great games on it imo. The only amazing game I can think of that's on it is Mario Galaxy.",
                "PlayStation has the best library, Wii has probably the best shovelware, and Xbox has the best copycat Library",
                "The 360 was the last console I ever owned, and it was awesome.",
                "360 and PS had more games from third parties but  the Wii had Mario Kart and Punchout as well as the virtual console. Punchout gotta be in my top 3 games of all time so I\u2019m going with that.",
                "Nintendo is my favorite, but the 360 had some of the all time greats. Fable 2 alone was enough to top most games on PS3 and Nintendo.",
                "PS3 by this is the only generation where Xbox is close to comparable",
                "The 360 for sure",
                "Wii has Twilight Princess and Mario Galaxy 1-2 so it wins in my book",
                "A hacked Wii takes the cake. \ud83d\udd25"

                "Yep, no complaints about strongholds. They are fun, handcrafted experiences with interesting lore, good layout, and some unique settings (e.g., the battle across shipwrecks to the lighthouse in the NW Scosglen stronghold).\n\nThe worst thing about them is they make the hundred cookie-cutter dungeons feel absolutely horrible when played after.",
                "Helltides should be used as a contestation of currently held strongholds.",
                "They're nice, but once you finish with them you just return for fast travel or legion events. It would be nice to have something like in The Division, where when you capture a \"stronghold\" from time to time there are attacks and you have to defend it or you lose it. That would add replayability to the strongholds.",
                "Love them. More of them please. Honestly could you imagine a nightmare stronghold? Or a Seasonal Stronghold?\n\nWalk up to the bells in the stronghold and get one of the current strongholds just cut out from the environment with nightmare affixes or seasonal monsters sprinkled throughout.",
                "Strongholds are definitely the best content the game has other than main story. Blizzard should aim to expand on them and have new ones each season.",
                "I wish they were replayable. Having Nightmare versions with better rewards would also be great. Better yet, targetable unique rewards and/or cosmetics.",
                "If they aren\u2019t going to swap renown rewards 4 and 5, need 5-6 strongholds in each map.",
                "Yes, make Nightmare Strongholds. I really like them too and wish there was a reason or way to do them multiple times.",
                "Stronghold siege should be mass event just like legions and keep respawning at regular interval - idealy for some more original rewards.. because I think the big problem is with minor exception of mats - everything just drops the same shit and nothing has unique loot tables - neither the boss, nor event.",
                "You know why you like strongholds? because a human made them.\n\nThe garbage that is NM dungeons is just auto generated.",
                "I guess I'm in the minority when I say I think they are just ok. I really don't see the replayability with them without them becoming boring. As far as I can remember only a few of them stood out as creative. The rest was based on the same boring concept just like ever dungeon with their few boring objectives.",
                "Some of the best conent in the whole game, they are fun every time.",
                "I agree.  I realized this when I was running Temple of Rot and Onyx Hold to quickly farm experience.  I would leave the stronghold before the final boss so I could keep running it.  Those two in particular are fantastic experience pre level 50.  Once I was done with them, on my final run I went to the boss to complete them.\n\nThere was dialogue between my character and the bandit leader final boss of Onyx Hold.  It made me feel like there was some life in here.  A backstory to this stronghold that I was intrigued by.  The atmosphere of Temple Rot did this as well.  When your character see's the giant corpse that all these people had been worshipping, your character talks about it to themselves.  It made me wonder what the backstory was of this place.\n\nIt reminded me of how I felt running a dungeon for the first time back when I was a young boy playing WoW.  I was drawn to the theme of the dungeon, and the little bits of lore you would get throughout, as well as the dialogue coming from bosses.  I used to get lost down rabbit holes reading lore of these bosses and other characters on wikis.\n\nThe game needs more of this for sure.",
                "Completely right. I think Strongholds are really the only thing in the game that I can say are pretty much perfect. I love the stories that each unique stronghold has.",
                "Did they add new strongholds or something? Or is this a pointless post about something that\u2019s been in the game to \u201ccombat the toxicity\u201d of the sub",
                "How the fuck do you get to them being awesome? \n\nLol. Jesus christ dude. \n\nThey are for all intents and purposes just an event.\n\nWtf are you even on?",
                "They're like a 6 out of 10 at best.\n\nYou only get to do them once, the mechanics are not very engaging and the boss fights are bland.",
                "They are pretty fun.",
                "nice blizzard empoloyee content. downvote",
                "Should make conquer Stronghold somewhat longer, like 15-20 minutes with multiple stages.      \n\nDefending Stronghold against wave after wave of enemies. Group up with your friend, or split up, what if enemy are too strong ? abandon bonus object or risk to fail the whole mission.  \n\nSo many potentials to make the game fun, with friends.",
                "I really really really want a nightmare/seasonal stronghold rotation, new or current strongholds. And at the end you fight a random campaign boss.",
                "Yeah, one of the best additions to D4. I\u2019d like to see them expanded.",
                "They are just the inbetween of cellars and dungeons.  I agree more would be nice or if they reset every once in a while for whatever reason.",
                "They\u2019re super well done and fun. I\u2019d love to see that design space utilized a bit more going forward as I think there\u2019s more potential",
                "Strongholds are a great part of the base game.",
                "Stronghold were some of my favorite content! Had some of the most diverse gameplay",
                "Love strongholds and would like to see blizz add some endgame version of them",
                "They could of been better. Some, especially early, are a challenge.",
                "I love the strongholds, I think some of the towns should be taken over and turned into strongholds randomly throughout the day with different objectives and such...",
                "Would love to have the ability to reset them and have more of them",
                "I wish they were repeatable.  Having them as a \"one and done\" seems like a waste.",
                "True but would be great if we could re use them by making then Helltide or Tree of whispers endgame variants.",
                "Hey hey hey stop it. No positivity. U can either bash the devs / or the patches / or compare the game to d2 or poe. / max u can do is say smthg like this is crap but maybe after some seasons it wont be crap that much. Thanks.",
                "Strongholds are literally the only thing that is fun to me now that I've finished the story.",
                "Strongholds are the best thing in the game by far",
                "They are my favorite 'event' to take on. When season 1 began, was the first thing I bee-lined to once at the appropriate level. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBlizzard, we need nightmare versions of these suckers.",
                "I don't understand why mobs aren't taking them back? Looked like it could be set up for something fun and exciting to do. What annoys me the most is that blizzard nerfed them so hard. You really question if you're playing arpg or not when you kill mobs in there and they drop no loot because people were farming them. Why do they keep balancing the game around people racing to 100 or some other goal? It only affects the rest of us.\n\nCall me crazy I thought this game was about killing mobs and getting loot. When you kill mobs and they drop nothing that's just poor design. \\*I should clarify elites in this case.",
                "I think a cool mechanic would be if guards helped you push back enemies in the wilderness. Eventually you would all make it to the stronghold and take it together. Then slowly the wilderness would grow stronger again and attack the stronghold. Eventually causing it to be lost. This could just be a cycle that goes on forever. But you get rewards like, unlocking a world boss for that day if you take the stronghold.",
                "Agreed, I think this aspect of the game is universally praised",
                "If they cared about gameplay, they'd have a multi year plan for a storyline based on the attempted invasion that changes based on where players defend and where they are pushed back. There would be towns unavailable, newly spawned dungeons, etc. The campaign for s1 was pitifully short.",
                "Strongholds are a great *start to something great for the game. On their own, They're only good for renown. Not even that useful for storybuilding rn",
                "Its unfortunate you have to say \"Something positive\" for a post in this sub....",
                "Or that they were replayable. They're easily the most fun content of the gane.",
                "Yes and no \n\nThey are but people have begun exploiting them for xp farms.. that has to be stopped",
                "They NEED to implement them into endgame",
                "You can get good exp off em too, just kill everything but the boss and leave, it will reset",
                "Thank you very much for saying something nice :) \nI appreciate it a lot and agree that strongholds are an awesome feature",
                "Strongholds need their own dungeon like system so we can replay them at customized difficulties. They are basically super dungeons, and the dev team clearly spent way more time on them than on regular dungeons, so why of all things are the regular dungeons the content that gets recycled to us instead of the strongholds???\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOh, but please leave the affixes out until they're fixed to actually be fun.",
                "Just the ice one that I hate. The others are good.",
                "I wish we can replay them. Maybe make replay-able as instanced content with higher difficulty. They are much more interesting and fun than dungeons.",
                "I liked them the first time. Pretty boring doing them on 2nd seasonal character.",
                "I would not change the stronghold but the NM keys you get. If you have not completed the stronghold, maybe you should not get a NM key for the dungeons unlocked through strongholds.",
                "I loved the strongholds and would like to see events where you have to prevent the forces of Hell from retaking them, similar to strongholds in guild wars 2.maybe have strongholds be under siege if a helltide forms around them, something that makes me have to go back and smash demons, I think it'd be fun.",
                "You know what would be even better, if they add one we can take over, and place merchant stands in as a player hub.. because their city design is from 2004.  Blizzard of all companies should understand how to make player hubs ffs.",
                "I would rather endlessly run Strongholds than Nightmare Dungeons and Helltide.",
                "That swamp stronghold on the south east was one of the most fun and tense moments for me on hardcore.",
                "The chat keeps talking about how strongholds are permanent but mine keep resetting?",
                "I really really wish that when helltides come through we would lose the strongholds to the demons use them as events to get splinters and stuff. Then once the helltide is over just give it back to us.",
                "so is the main story, you do it once and then the game begins, 3rd 4th season down the line it wont matter\u2026.",
                "i think strongholds, helltides, and the story were the only things i thought was innovative in D4.",
                "The way to replay strongholds is to make a new seasonal character\u2026.",
                "I like them better than dungeons. No running around aimlessly, nice plots and fights.",
                "A little bit too short for my taste, but it would b awesome if they would develop them maybe  into a fully fledged and longer dungeon?",
                "Strongholds are the format dungeons should have been.  Challenging.  Exciting.  Sometimes just a tiny bit frustrating. New.  Inventive.  \n\nAnd I'm sure Rob made the designers throw it all out for caring boxes just so he could shave six months off of development.",
                "Like everyone here I hope for temporary-taken strongholds in future content. But I mostly love the permanent unlocked ones, that turn into a whole new town with quests. The Druid one was really really cool. Clearng such a stronghold feels very impactful (much more than clearing a cursed ruin that then remains a ruin, just no longer cursed :p). So I hope the exansions will bring a form of both.",
                "I wish there were varying versions of the Stronghold experience with challenges and enemy interactions that you could do nightmare versions of!",
                "i hope they dont ruin it like they nerfed helltide... what happened to target farming with those helltide chests???",
                "I agree, the strongholds were the best part of getting the Lilith statues =) I def enjoyed the challenge and story",
                "Let's not forget sound. That horn firing when you get to know the place is icing on the cake to me.",
                "And they mostly got some decent Mob Density.",
                "Can't believe I'm saying this but the Division 2 system of monsters taking back the Strongholds would be great and you'd get an indicator on your map when it is being taken over. I hope they implement this system",
                "Yea but who wants.to keep doing the same one over and over and over",
                "All the tired ass side-quests should have been scrapped and you should have been doing many, many times more Strongholds to re-take the land from the minions of hell. This should have been tied into the main story as well.",
                "The tur dulra stronghold makes the druid class quest by far the best class quest in the game. All of the other classes do some meandering bullshit, but druid? Nah, you gotta vanquish evil and reclaim the druid stronghold, then go help the spirits.",
                "yeah sure they are great but once you beat them that's it... no more strongholds.",
                "I hope they really lean into strongholds in future seasons. Maybe have a thing where you can spawn super hard legion events at them and a loss there means you lose control of them. Assault of Astaroth or something.",
                "Agreed. Strongholds are great. They need to make these some kind of end game activity though. Many possibilities for those in the future. It really is a shame you do them once and it\u2019s over.",
                "I want to re-clear strongholds like a legion event with other players that you can join up for, i also want more surprise bosses like the Butcher",
                "The strongholds are cool and if the overworld really is \u201calive\u201d then have the strongholds be reclaimed randomly by the monsters that persist. \n\nBetter yet, tie a continuous story to it of particular goings on in the vein of a mystery group performing rituals, etc. that can be a B or C plot to the overall story.",

I will appeal to Ru\u2019s humor and nostalgia with older Black pop culture references. We\u2019ll have a debate which judges are naughty or nice. My phone-a-friend will be Black Jesus.\n\nIf there happens to be another Black Santa contender, my second choice is Queen Latifah. She\u2019s a multi-hyphenate icon so I\u2019ll have a lot of material to work with.",
                "Odd choice but I'd do Anne Boleyn. I'd have my dress on a dress mannequin, sit on the floor with my hands through the sleeves and my head on the table so I could write my answers but still be 'beheaded'. Sure there's only so much humor in my head being chopped off, but tbh I would be shooting for safe instead of trying to win, but that's just me. I can crack some jokes at Henry the 8th though.",

I could also reference Dela\u2019s snatch game as Paul Lynde and make jokes about him.\n\nBarbara Eden as Jeannie from I Dream of Jeannie would slay.\n\nSure the characters are from the 60s and 90s but I can at least guarantee Ru would know who they are in comparison to modern celebrities. They\u2019re eccentric and/or playful enough that I can tap into that and get some laughs from Ru and Michelle",

Well because the Travail trailer is titled \"Teyvat chapter\"...as if there's gonna be other chapters, beyond the Dark Sea maybe. Until now we still have no idea what's beyond the Dark Sea and if there's other continents.\n\nAlso I can see them stretching the Khaenri'ah and Celestia chapter for years\n\nIt's like how Honkai Impact took 7 years to be done with only PART 1 of the story, now they're in Part 2",

And what's the deal with the Sinner? Are they actually the Second Who Came, and if that's the case then, that's a final boss material just sitting right there.

X.0, X.1, X.2 (the main story) then X.6 (archon quest and rerun). In addition, every prior nation then gets one patch dedicated to it as well. So in 4.X, we will need 4 patches, Mondstadt, Liyue, Inazuma and Sumeru. Then there's a 'All the nations' patch (Cards in 3.X and Poetry festival in 2.X), Finally, we need to have GAA or equivalent as the final patch. \n\nSo that means 4.x will *at least* get to 4.9, if not 4.10 for an even number.

The reasons I don't play survivor are basically:  \n\n\n1. I don't find survivor fun to play.\n2. I prefer relying on my own skill and luck rather than on a team.\n3. I feel too much pressure when playing as part of a team, especially since I don't play survivor well.\n4. The time investment I would need to get good at survivor just isn't worth it for a role I don't find fun.\n5.

He's been playing 4+ years, longer than me, and he's awful at naming killer perks. He'll say she's got ruin and we find out it was in fact jolt. He also says stuff like she's camping me, when the killer is on the opposite side of the map chasing someone else. And a killer can tunnel him just by looking at him with 5 gens left and no hooks.\n\nPeople should play both sides because it's a big learning experience but this guy just refuses.",
                "I exclusively play survivor (tried to play killer, only getting prestige on hag, one on pyramid head and one on billy)\n\nKiller for me is just too stressing, a lot of things to pay attention to. Also one time I got my first bully squad which traumatized me.",
                "I prefer playing survivor even though SoloQ is hell. I'm more of a team player and like playing support. And I like games with a bit of down time/breathing room. Killer doesn't really have that. I still play Killer from time to time, but I play them very memey, chill and forgiving. High MMR killer feels more like a chore and even winning a high MMR match is often not that fun",

I really enjoyed learning the survivor-habits from an outside perspective, just like David Attenborough did with the antelopes, and decided to stick with this approach. Recently I started SWFing with a streamer I met, but my main motivation is getting to meet killers that aren't me. :P\n\nPlaying survivor is scary. I don't like being hunted. I don't like letting my team down. There are other cooperative titles I enjoy more to play with friends.",
                "Yes, there are a lot of people like that. Some for good reasons (can\u2019t play killer with friends or just not interested in survivor gameplay). \n\nThe funny thing is they usually have the most to say about game balance despite only understanding half the game.",

It frustrates me so I quit :/",

I end up losing them in chase constantly and maybe get 1 kill a match.\n\nIt opens me up to being bullied match after match after match, and I'm just not equipped for that level of toxicity directed at me.\n\nSo I don't play killer often at all. \n\nI will stick with my terrible survivor builds that I play because I like the perks and survive 35 to 50% of the time.",
                "The average survivor I play against has hundreds or thousands of hours and half of the achievements, including none of the ones you'd get for just piddling around in killer for a while.\n\n2K hours and 46% of the achievements.

                "I want to play killer more, I just feel bad when I have a derp (which is often) and don\u2019t do well. I don\u2019t care what other people think since I don\u2019t have chat post-game, but I hold myself to a stupidly high standard.",
                "I used to only play survivor- out of the ~830 hours I have, only ~30 hours are killer & the vast majority of that is recent. \n\nWhen I was strictly a survivor main, it was because I was getting bullied hard in almost every killer match I played when I\u2019d try to do a daily or challenge. I very rarely tilt as survivor, but it really sucked being endlessly looped by people better than me who were also blinding me & tbagging constantly, so killer wasn\u2019t fun to learn & I just gave up at some point. \n\nWhat got me to try again was the recent anniversary event. I just came back from a very long hiatus & I heard the masks were easier to farm as killer, so I went in with the intent of being a friendly killer. Aim for 8 hooks and let them go, light farming if there was time at the end. Turned out to be a great way to get some practice while not stressing about getting kills (because all I cared about was the masks), and I grew to enjoy the role. Now I\u2019m still a survivor main, but I do enjoy killer and I have fun even when I\u2019m playing seriously (always with Lightborn though, still hate those flashlights lol).",
                "I used to play only killer, but last year i started playing way more survivor after getting stressed playing killer, i feel i got a lot better at the game after that. People should try to play both sides to see things how really are, it's painful to see survivor mains complaining about going against the strongest killers a lot but not understanding how miserable it is to play m1 killers or weaker killers in general, or killer mains not wanting to understand how awful it is to get tunneled and deleted out of a match in 3 minutes.",
                "I'm not that good as a survivor but that's what I'm playing exclusively. I just can't play as killer, it actually gives me a lot of anxiety and stress, compared to being tunneled and camped.",
                "Yes. \n\nI met a killer main with over 1000 hours last week. He played survivor for a daily and was playing like he was literally brand new.\n\nI messaged him because I thought he was throwing. He kept moving when I tried to heal him out of dying state and I had buckle up so... I got a little annoyed and just asked why he did that. He said he didn't know moving cancelled the heal and thought I stopped healing him on purpose. We chatted for a bit, I gave him some pointers and apologised for accusing him of intentionally throwing.\n\nBut like... I was in awe of the fact I was playing with a literal noob that has over a 1000 hours in 1 half of the game lmao.",
                "Yes, I used to game with a guy who would only ever play survivor. It was honestly so frustrating because his view was so VERY one sided and he would rage SO hard over things that shouldn\u2019t have been so upsetting. Had he taken the time to play a few killer matches his gameplay and understanding would have improved SO much. But he was adamantly a killer hater and refused to try to play killer. He would get so aggravated when we would try to encourage him to do so as well. \n\nHe was the epitome of the us vs them killer vs survivor squad mentality. I\u2019m pretty sure he felt he 1. Couldn\u2019t hack it as killer and 2. Felt like he would be betraying something by trying. \n\nEither way I\u2019m not sad that I now say someone I USED to play with no one needs to be subjected to that kind of toxicity when playing a game. Regardless of it was directed at me or someone else.",
                "What's shocking is how easy to spot they are.",
                "I very rarely get in the mood of killing people.\nI dislike chasing mostly if I'm not in the mood, I was like that since childhood, always enjoyed hiding and being one pursued more than being the Pursuerer.\n\nTho it's not like I don't touch it.\nCombined on both PC and mobile I have about 1.2k hours of which I'd say 450-500 is on killer.",
                "I play both, but I've got friends that only play 1 side. \n\nThe majority of my friends actually main killer which is the funny part (I added a lot through vsing them in solo queue). I have asked a few of them about it before too. I boils down to either: they aren't good at chase as survivor and don't like getting tunneled out because of it, or they get too frustrated by stupid choices teammates make and don't want to deal with it. Out of the few survivor mains I have added, they either only play in SWFs or they just found killer boring to play.",
                "I only play survivors because when I play killer, people are treating me like a dog and are toxic towards me.\n\nAt least when I play survivor I don't have to deal with toxicity every game for every single move that I can make, and I can make sure that the killer has at least a non-toxic survivor in the game (and try to make them happy if they DC and if they are on console). Also, I can play with my friends.",
                "I'm convinced survivor mains on twitter have never touched killer once in their entire lives",
                "I play 80-20 survivor-killer. Killer is miserable to play in the current meta with perks such as MFT, Soul Guard + Unbreakable, Buckle Up + FTP, and many more. Not only that, but it feels like if you're not pressuring every survivor at the same time, gens fly by with no chance to do anything.",
                "I pretty much exclusively play survivor because I enjoy feeling like a part of the team. Almost every time I've tried to play killer I feel left out, so I end up letting them all go lol",
                "Im dogshit at survivor and rage alot",
                "I have played survivor exactly twice over the course of some 2000 hours played and one of those two times was the intro tutorial. I could go on for ages pretending it's because killer is more varied, self sufficient and all that. \n\nBut really I'm just an actual sociopath getting my angy out in a fun and socially acceptable way.",
                "My best friend only plays survivor side because he has stated he finds it far too stressful playing killer. He says it\u2019s because he is entirely responsible for how a match goes when he plays killer and it just puts too much pressure on him to make it enjoyable. \n\nI play both sides because there\u2019s characters I love on both. I also enjoy the feeling of playing killer a lot of the time and then like to switch back to survivor for a while to get a tense experience when I have good chases!",
                "I play 95% Killer and Its primarily because of the different powers. I wanna fly around the map at high speeds. I like survivor( mostly for the looney toons nonsense you can pull) but Killer is more consistently different and fun.",
                "Survivor gameplay is very boring to me.\n\nAll of it, gens, chase, rescuing.",
                "I play whatever is giving bonus BP or related to a tome challenge. \nI do prefer killer, however. I derive some notable joy from jumpscares with undetectable killers.",
                "I\u2019m bad at survivor.",
                "I used to exclusively play survivor simply because I was petrified of learning the killer mechanics since there\u2019s a *lot* of pressure to be a decent killer and I didn\u2019t want to embarrass myself lol\n\nAfter 6-ish years of playing on and off I am now more comfortable playing killer and I can actually get 4K\u2019s pretty decently! I\u2019m proud of myself for learning the killer mechanics and not letting embarrassment or the complexity of the role make me afraid to play as a killer :)",
                "I can\u2019t hit skill checks, at all.",
                "I played survivor with my friend sometimes but when he\u2019s offline I usually stick to killer",
                "I play both but I definitely play and enjoy survivor more, I enjoy learning about the maps and how to run them and in addition how to counter each killer\u2019s power. I\u2019m not the best survivor in the world but I would call myself fairly competent. I\u2019m approaching 2,000 hours and it feels super good to try out a new trick or mindgame on survivor and have it work. It\u2019s also fun to play with other competent players as solo queue can be frustrating.",
                "I used to play both Survivor and Killer, depending on whichever side was getting a blood point bonus, but I ended up switching to playing Killer exclusively because I have more fun as the Killer and I am absolutely terrible at playing Survivor and wasn't really improving.\n\nThough funnily I think spending so much time playing Killer and focusing on it has made me a better survivor. I did one Survivor match the other day just for the hell of it and my strategy of \"do the things that I find annoying when playing Killer\" was extremely effective. I managed to lose the killer on two different chases, something typically unheard of for me. Though maybe it was an MMR or new killer thing.\n\nBut generally, I just like playing Killer more. I like how playing different Killers completely changes the flow of the match, and I like playing less popular Killers to give Survivors a challenging experience against Killers they might not see too often.",
                "I like 99% play survivor because I like having a team to mess around with. If you're playing survivor and you give another surv some butt smacks or spin with them, you then go about your business afterwards. Do anything remotely friendly as killer and people expect you to throw the whole game for farming.",
                "I have around 540 hours on survivor and about 40 on killer. I actually like playing killer I just don\u2019t like being bullied, I\u2019m very sensitive by nature and it takes a toll on me.",
                "I only play survivor. I play with my friend and never play on my own, therefore I'd have no desire to play killer.",
                "I play survivor cause it\u2019s harder than killer, plus I can actually see my cosmetics",
                "Yeah because i find one side of the game fun and the other not\n\nWhat kind of a question is that?",
                "I only play killer because killer acts over the survivors, not the other way around.",
                "Yes, and largely because playing solo queue survivor is awful. You kinda need friends to play with if you're doing Survivor for more than a game or two just to make the experience tolerable, as solo queue survivor is more often than not four idiots who all think they're the only genius in a room full of idiots. (And yes, that does include me.)",
                "Yea me. Killer scares me, as in I don\u2019t think I will do enough, I don\u2019t like how joggy and big you feel with restricted movement and I don\u2019t have the blood points to spend on builds so I\u2019ll stick to survivor",
                "Dude I play so much killer that I didn\u2019t know survivors had a sprint button until I played survivor. I started getting chased, and couldn\u2019t figure out why I was still so slow",
                "I play both, but I play survivor only with friends. I don't play survivor often.",
                "I'm Killer pretty exclusive. I find Survivor lame. I like the challange of taking on 4 people and at least taking out 2.",
                "I mainly play surviors now. I played killer some primarily just for bloodpoints bonuses and challenges. I find killer boring. I don't enjoy chases, and getting kills isn't satisfying since killer is the most offensive person on the field. Survivor is much more fun to me, and winning/escaping is satisfying.",
                "Killing people is wrong.",
                "Yes, and it's a big problem. Mostly because it's usually the Survivor side that does this, and has no idea how bad things are on the Killer side and sees the tremendously broken shit like MFT or both iterations of Dead Hard or old DS as \"fair and balanced\". Or thinks that trash ass Alien perk is actually good, or that the regression perks all being gutted was a good thing.",
                "I mean yea. Over like 1700 hours of my DBD 95% of it is killer  and 5% is survivor.\n\nThe reason I don't play survivor as much is because I usually would SWF but I'm also a pretty toxic person competitively. So I usually avoid it.",
                "For a long time i only played survivor but after enough hours you simply try killer here and there",
                "I usually play survivor when my friend wants to play, and killer if I get an urge to play dbd alone \n\nI used to only play survivor since killer was stressful when I first began (the Haddonfield theme still haunts me), but now killer is mostly relaxing and easy for me, also very happy with the addition of Hux",
                "I only play killer.",
                "Yup, pure killer here. I've played survivor maybe 5 times cause I thought it'd be fun. It wasn't. I play a lot of different killers though.",

                "I\u2019ve played both and gone through periods of playing one more than the other, but the fact is a prefer survivor and the times I tend to play have shorter queues for survivor so that\u2019s what I play. Anyone who wants to get better at the game should play both.",
                "i mostly play survivor because i just find playing the killer is boring af. i find looping the killer a  whole lotta fun since i actually get clean moments like doing a 360 that suceeds and then stunning. or just flashlighting the killer or getting a power struggle save.",
                "I only played killer back when i still played. Why? Cuz playing clown was fun as hell and im ass at looping.",
                "Yes, I main survivor. Playing killer stresses me out and gives me anxiety, not too sure why. If I absolutely need to play killer (need extra rift fragments or want a reward in an event tome) I try to choose non-sacrifice challenges and will then usually pick Pig or Ghostface to befriend survivors. I wish I felt more comfortable playing killer because I love playing those two characters (it's why I bought them). Also doesn't help that they're some of the weaker choices in the game.",
                "In my 650 hours of DBD I've only played survivor so far and I'm not looking to play killer any time soon.\nI'm enjoying the aspect of being threatened and having to survive, I like playing in a team and doing tasks together and helping other people, I even like to give my own life in order to let my team escape.\nI love being stealthy and mindgaming the killer by smart positioning, being chased and making the killer lose me or investing time to eventually down me (which doesn't take too much time unfortunately) and I enjoy doing gens! Having a little break from the interaction with the killer, minding my own business and still be helpful for the team. \nEven the thought of playing killer stresses me out, there is too much pressure for me, having to perform well enough to hunt and kill 4 other players.",
                "I HEAVILY play killer over survivor.\n\nMainly because I can have the game flow well, no need to tunnel or face camp, it seems every other game I play survivor I experience one of those for my team. Not to mention the dc's/kill yourself on hook survivors almost guarantee a 3-4cap which isn't great as a survivor, and being body blocked by other survivors is just absurd.\n\nSo much better to just play the game.",
                "I play survivor 98% of the time. I play killer whenever there's a new archive if I've exhausted all of the survivor challenges and still need to progress down the rift. I find killer completely unfun, and stressful. There's too many things for me to keep track of and I get overwhelmed. Solo Q is super rough, but still better to me than playing killer.",

                "I have more control over things as the killer and with my dumpstered MMR I can kinda do whatever I want and still cap out all the categories except sacrifice. Which means ez bp. Very very rarely do I play survivor. The vast vast vast majority of the time its killer.",
                "I play both roles (but highly prefer killer) but I'd say a sizable percentage of the survivor player base only plays survivor. Most of my friends who play only play survivor and casually at that. Which is fine, it's the role that makes sense if you see Dead By Daylight as a party game. I don't and ended up in a different place lmao",
                "I don\u2019t play survivor since I don\u2019t find it fun. I usually die first and feel like I\u2019m slamming my head against a wall. I\u2019d also rather be a killer hunting people.",

Maybe 500 hours of that playing Killer during those 7 years, mainly to grind dailies and challenges. I don't enjoy killing people, it doesn't really spark any joy in me. It's really helpful tho to understand the game better and it's a lot of bps...",

                "Yes, I started off only playing killer because I couldn't hit skill checks. I hated QTEs in almost all video games, but I've gotten better at them thanks to other games so now I play both sides.",
                "I no longer play killer exclusively, but the reasons I used to do it were:\n\n1. Knowing how to loop as survivor didn't seem as appealing to me as learning how to mindgame as killer\n2. Even knowing how to loop, as survivor I felt bad going down early because I was letting down my team, as killer falling back I can just leave the chase or not try was hard since it's only me, I'm not throwing for other 3 people that potentially want to win\n3. Even then, it feels awful knowing how to loop but being forced to do unsafe gens with no safety iun deadzones, so my skill felt mostly the map rather than me\n4. Some killers (mostly Slinger, Clown and Wraith) are so uninteractive that matching up against them seemed like a waste of time",

                "I wouldn\u2019t say I *only* play one side, but it\u2019s definitely 99% killer. Reason is none of my friend play dbd, plus I just think killer is more fun. Survivor is really just the same character with different skins (I know there are differences like size and sounds made, but ultimately it\u2019s true). Killers are just much more interesting and satisfying.",
                "I only play killer most of the time but when I'm with friends I play surv, if I wanna play surv alone I do 1v1s on DBD league discord server it's more entertaining",

                "For me it is like 70/30 split between survivor and killer. The main reasons are because i sometimes play with friends or i get tilted so much easier as killer than survivor. But there was a whole year where i didn't play killer at all so i can definetly belive there are people that only play one side.",
                "I only play killer. Its more fun than getting chased. I especially love killing people who tbag and are douches and watching them disconnect. Prob my favorite part of it all",

                "I wonder if there are people who play close to 50/50 killer and survivor. Also kinda curious if the gaming genre they usually play has something to do with which side they favor more.",
                "I go where the bonus takes me, but I assume there are people who only play one side. I like survivor more because I like sneaking and being surprised and the \"oh fuck\" moments when killers lock on to you. \n\nI enjoy killer as well though, as some of their powers are hilarious (like vomiting on people as Plague cracks me up every time).",
                "I'll echo what others have said and say, yeah, I only really enjoy killer. I've given survivor multiple chances, but it's just a whole other game tbh. One that I don't find very interesting. Killing and chasing is fun, trying out different powers and perfecting your gameplay as killer hits my brain in a way survivor doesn't. But on that note, I believe survivor is an all around harder role than killer to master, and I respect the players who can loop me to hell and back.",
                "Survivor only.\nBefore when i started i played both and for a period i even considered my self main killer but the anxiety and stress i had to go through was too much and after one specific match i got so destroyed i cried and took out on my keyboard\ud83d\ude14 after that i got kinda traumatized. \nAlso I like meme builds and playing just for fun, not trying to win and as killer that is very limited",
                "I only play killer. Because I get mind numbingly bored as survivor. Also I just feel useless as a survivor, my contributions never seem worth it. But as a killer my gameplay IS everything, it's what determines the difficulty of the match, I can directly analyze and make decisions.",

Dredge and Spirit are my worst killers to face against :( ). DBD isn't really a game for hard of hearing people.\n\nI've recently hit a wall with playing survivor and I'm warming more to the idea of trying out killer again. So far I've only tested custom lobbies and yes I keep on losing survivors cuz I can't tell where I hear their injured noises",

Like, even if there were archetypes. Gameplay is so stagnant. You win by gen rushing. I put on Deja Vu, hold M1, and take a nap till chased.\n\nThen, on top of it, very few survivor challenges are interesting. Most are \"Do gens, Unhook/Protection, or Heal\" x times. Whoooooo.",

Toxic SWFs make it even more so because I can mock them for being trash lovers who gotta bully the babies because they got huge egos which get fractured easily.\n\nBaby survivors are another thing to run into since they don't really know how to play effectively yet. These are the ones I always try not to injure at all alongside giving hatch for free to since they deserve a free win after running into the toxic killers who hate fun and are merciless...\n\nPlus once in a while I get friendly survivors who I chill/do goofy stuff with :)",

Hard tunnelling whenever I can, survivors deserve nothing.",
                "I've only been playing a few months but I've taken probably only 10 or so killer games. Yeah I've only lost one but I get a bit nervous to play killer. However I do prefer winning based of my own plays and decisions rather than relying on a team, I've had too many games dying on first hook because I get new players or clueless survivors that make me see the appeal in killer. I've been playing it more recently and I can only assume the number will increase as I get more and more used to it. I hit bronze on killer for the first time like two days ago so its just about me not playing the role much",

Getting steamrolled as killer feels like shit, and I don\u2019t like the pressure of gens popping and feeling like I\u2019m constantly on a time limit. I\u2019m also not a fan of chasing when all the pallets are up, I don\u2019t enjoy going from one loop to another to another. Pallet shredding simulator just isn\u2019t fun.

And then once in a while I'll get a easy match and killing new survivors isn't a great experience either for me. So essentially playing killer only adds stress to my life, which is funny because the reason I was attracted to this game was the 1v4 aspect, and mained killer for months before leaving the game once, and then hated it as soon as I restarted.\n\nMight have been because most survivors these days are good at chases and I'm absolutely horrible at it",

We all have our moments of useless Survivor fills, but I really cannot go one game in Survivor fills without wondering if I'm playing with a re-named Bot or an unborn fetus with how quick everyone dies/doesn't do objectives/literally stands around somewhere forever.\n\nBeing a Killer, I can at least play the game as a solo role, and perform well depending on my own skill, as well as face off against people who will try their hardest to not die. One funny thing I notice is in any game similar to DBD I play - my Killer games will always have smart Survivors, and as a Survivor? Pure idiots. (Staring at Identity V, Tom and Jerry Chase, etc.)",
                "Definitely not exclusively, but it's like 95% survivor for me. I mostly play with friends, so unless we have enough for a custom game, killer is usually off the table. I enjoy killer, but if Im alone Im more likely to try catching up on my single-player backlog than to jump back into dbd",
                "I only play killer because I like defining the flow of the match. I don\u2019t Tunnel, Camp, or Hump downed survivors and I play all types of killers so survivors don\u2019t have to play against Wesker every game. (I still play him sometimes). Also, I don\u2019t want to experience what it\u2019s like to play against Wesker every game, nor do I want to spend 50% of my time on a generator.",
                "I only play killer. It's not that I don't play survivor, but I find it extremely boring and easy, so I only play that when I need to make tome challenges that gives you some cosmetic or something",
                "When I first started playing killer, I had a 4 man loop me for so long, teabagging etc. I was a noob and they abused me. I got so mad I refused to play killer after that.\n\nAfter about 700 hours of solo q, I decided to try killer once more. I played as the plague and had a good time, so I play killer a little more often now.",
                "Survivor because I like team based games. Killer when I want the new trophies, or I\u2019m having a losing streak in s\u00f3lo q. I only play s\u00f3lo q as well,",
                "I am a survivor main, and only touch killer when the daily ritual won\u2019t stop spamming killer dailies and I\u2019m fed up. \ud83d\ude02 then I just do my challenge and sit in a corner after. I suck as killer, I have a hard time sometimes with tracking movement in game vs RL(say kid runs past, my brain goes to that, vs screen\u2026 it murders my chases. If kid does this as survivor in chase, I can locker dive generally with quick and quiet)",
                "The killer POV makes me motion sick.",
                "I play both almost equally. I find it helps me better understand both sides of the struggle. When I'm a killer and someone hits me with a good blast mine or flashbang play, I'm more impressed now than I am angry",
                "One of my friends will not play killer ever and he\u2019s truly missing out.",
                "I play easily 98% killer . I find survivor crazy boring . You either hide in a bush , hold a button on a gen , or run around in a circle and stand still at one point of a circle to see if the killer double backs . If he does you just leave the circle for another circle for more distance or double back yourself . That\u2019s just how I feel , nothing against people who find that enjoyable .",
                "While I do try survivor every once and a while I immediately go back to killer when solo queue becomes too hellish for me.",
                "Yes I only play killer. \nSurvivor bores the shit out of me and I'd rather be able to blame myself for a loss then some random I can't communicate with. Back when  my friends played the game and in a 4 stack it was fun. But they all quit and I just started playing again after like 4 years of not playing.",
                "I have 2.5k/3k hours as killer but have been playing more survivor recently , killer against all the top level SWF\u2019s is rarely anything but completely sweaty\u2026",
                "I just don't find survivor gameplay fun. I still try to see from the survivor's point of view, and understand how their perks work, but I only like playing killer.",
                "I usually play survivor, but killer is quite more fun in my opinion. Although it\u2019s easier to get trolled as a killer by a bunch of friends who play all together.\n\nI get that some people only want to main certain part of the \u201cgameplay\u201d, but to think like a survivor/killer you gotta play survivor/killer.",
                "I play nearly exclusively killer. Why? I feel like I can finally have power and be feared and when the survivors are toxic I take great joy in killing them.",
                "I mostly play killer, and really only ever play survivor to test out new survivors that come out or if my friends want me to play with them which is pretty rare. I just, really don't enjoy playing survivor all that much? The only fun part of it for me is being chased, and I usually end up going against killers who camp, tunnel, etc. \n\nIt's annoying and I'd rather play killer since I can usually slap survivors for doing stuff like that. You can't really do a whole lot other than leave the game or kill yourself on hook when a killer starts face camping you. I will say though, there are a LOT more toxic survivors than killers lol. Almost every game has tea baggers, flash light spammers, or people saying nasty things in the post game chat.",
                "There is. I don\u2019t personally play only one side but I\u2019ve seen tons of people that only play one side.",
                "I used to play killer back in 2017 have like everyone prestige 3. Since about 2019 I really only play survivor. My MMR is screwed or something bc every killer match it's p100 and p80s and they just bully me. Killer is just too much stress I know I shouldn't take it personally but that's just how I am. So every time I boot up a killer I have fun for a game or two and then my MMR shoots up for some reason and I get stomped. So now I just main survivor",
                "I mostly play survivor but I prefer killer. I only play survivor because of my friends but if I had the choice, killer is more fun, it\u2019s easier and survivor is just bland especially when you have to rely on teammates",
                "i only play survivor otherwise i just wanna be a friendly oreo and im anxious people r gonna be mad",
                "I mostly play survivor. Occasionally I\u2019ll hop on killer when they have 100% BP bonus.",
                "I only play killer, with the exception of playing survivor occasionally for Tomes. I enjoy the power fantasy of BEING the monster in horror movies as I\u2019ve always gravitated towards antagonists in media. They\u2019re just so much cooler than the heroes",
                "The last time I played survivor for more than a couple games was when Jeryl was still a thing. God I miss him.",
                "I rarely play killer because 1.  I\u2019m bad at killer and 2. I usually have friends that want to play",
                "Yes, I play Survivor 95% of the time. Even when I try and play killer with a relaxed mindset, I get really stressed and feel like I have to tryhard. I can turn my brain off more with survivor and just play for fun",
                "I started out as a survivor main, but at this point I play killer exclusively. Time is the main reason, I have maybe a couple of hours a day to play games, so I can't spend the majority of that staring at a lobby. When I first started out, survivor was instant and killer took forever, but right around the first ruin nerf, survivor went to 15-25 minute lobbies. Now killer lobbies are instant.",
                "one of my friends i play with only plays survivor because first person makes her motion sick. a few other friends only like playing in a group so they also only play survivor. I like playing both sides.",
                "I only play killer . I can\u2019t stand playing as a survivor . \nI tried for a few weeks as a survivor and it was miserable.",
                "I play both sides. But I was heavy surv main before. Now I have a main on killer but I still play surv more. Cuz I get stressed and don't wanna play, If I play killer a lot. But it always makes me laugh to see survs who doesn't know how killers perks or addons work.",
                "i only play survivor. every once in a blue moon i\u2019ll play killer but i get too frustrated at killer",

                "Survivor never seemed very fun, plus they got so little bp I never wanted to invest it into their perks when I could just put it into killer and get way more value",
                "Nearly exclusive killer, only play survivor if there's an event cosmetic I want or on rare occasions swfs with irl friends.\n\nIt looks like I share the same sentiment as quite a few here, I want to rely on myself and my own skill to succeed not get left out by a team. Additionally I think the killer gameplay experience is far more unique than gen-repair simulator",
                "I\u2019ve tried out killer a handful of times. I\u2019m not very good with it and I can\u2019t get the hang of how that side works out. I\u2019m bad at following scratch marks too. I\u2019m sure with more practice I\u2019d be fine but I enjoy playing survivor a lot.",
                "I stopped playing killer after the first SWF I encountered.\n\nSo many flashlights",
                "I play survivor unless I find myself behind on a rift in which case I farm as killer for the fragments. I just like the co op experience better, even as a solo player. I also like being chased more than chasing.",

                "Yea. I fuck around with friends (we never escape) so survivor exclusive baybee.\n\n\nI will add dbd isn\u2019t fun enough for either side to play solo.",
                "I play both but I struggle to play killer as much nowadays. Survivors are just too good at this point for me to keep up, and I almost always face at least 2 prestige 100 survivors. Until they fix the matchmaking I feel like I just have to quit Killer.",
                "Yes i only play killer because i hate randoms and dont like the discord",
                "I have a friend who thinks killer is dumb because he lost his first game (he played nurse and forgot to blink)",
                "I am big surwiwor main I have over 5k hours and less than 5% of that is killer I\u2019d say. I just don\u2019t find it that fun and I only really enjoyed huntress and wesker. I do want to play killer more tho to develop my understanding of the game and alien looks kinda fun so he could help. It\u2019s not even that it\u2019s not that fun per se I just fucking love survivor, that part of the game is so close to my heart and I always play with my friends and I truly think dbd is such a special game",

                "I play 95% killer for the exact reason most people hate: You're alone\n\nThere's no one to blame but myself, I can actually improve at the role",
                "I\u2019ve never even clicked the \u201cPlay as Survivor\u201d button. Dealing with rando teammates is scarier than the killer.",

                "Yes and they always have an opinion on the games balance for some reason \ud83d\ude44",
                "I only play killer because I hate jumpscares, and being chased makes me nervous, also being part of a team is so much social pressure",
                "I only play killer.  I have 1450 hours in the game and I would be willing to bet 1400 of them are killer.  There's the occasional time when my friends want to play with me and I'll queue up for some survivor, but the vast majority of my playtime is killer and that's what I exclusively play if I have a choice.\n\nThe reasoning behind it is that I like being the predator in these types of games.  I like being the main antagonist that the other players need to work together to beat.\n\nBeing able to choose which killer to play feels a lot more impactful to my gameplay experience than choosing what survivor I want to play, which is appealing.  \n\nMy success not being determined by three other people on my team is appealing.  My wins and losses are 100% on me and me alone.  I don't have to worry about a teammate throwing a winning position, which is nice.  \n\nThe killer cast is simply full of a more interesting group of characters than the survivor cast, and each of them having their own unique powers means that different killer perks can be strong or weak depending on what killer you're using them on.  Theorycrafting builds is simply more dynamic and interesting for killers.\n\nI don't like to just sit in one spot and hit skillchecks.  That doesn't sound fun to me.  With killer, there is ALWAYS something you should be doing.  The action doesn't stop for longs periods like it does for survivors.",
                "Yep playing only killer for about 800 hours total so far since the start. Never really liked the survivor side of things as I don't have a friend group that wants to play. I like winning and losing by myself and not getting frustrated with random teammates",
                "I pretty much only play killer, but i have to take long breaks because some days you face 4 man teams that you feel you just can\u2019t do anything against so then i quit for a while because it just isn\u2019t fun.",
                "i play killer like 75% of the time. i only play survivor to do the rift and tome challenges when needed. i don't find survivor fun really. \n\nthe game is very different for each side and one side might not be fun for some people.",
                "I only play Killer, Survivor's just not interesting at all to me. I want to be a nigh-unstoppable threat the Survivors try to avoid, it's the most appealing part of the game to me. It also has a much higher skill ceiling than survivor. Also, I don't have any Survivor perks.",
                "I've been playing almost exclusively killer since the clown chapter. Even I played survivor at first I just found it to boring. Especially by myself. Occasionally I'll switch for tome challenges but that's it. To boring and to easy. It's like night and day the difference in gameplay. On survivor I have earphones on, borrowed time base kit allowing for guaranteed escapes if done correctly which isn't hard. Playing survivor is so stress free its not even funny",
                "I only play survivor because I don\u2019t like first person gameplay. I like to see my character when I play and not just his/her hand or weapon. Plus I don\u2019t have the heart to kill survivor players, I feel sad when I hooked them (even if that is the mechanic of killer gameplay). I played once as killer, ended up letting everyone leave and never played killer again.",
                "I main killer, and dabbled in survivor. I recently started playing a lot more survivor, but that's just because Nic Cage exists. Otherwise, survivors is either you being bored on a gen, or getting chased for 5 minutes, just to realize your whole team had thumbs in their ass.",
                "I mainly play killer because I don\u2019t get on at the same time as my friends most of the time, but when they are on I\u2019ll gladly play survivor with them and have chill games",
                "I\u2019m really bad at survivor, and I find it less enjoyable than killer. The only time I ever play survivor is with my friends",
                "When I started playing I was scared of playing killer cuz of my first hillbilly match where I got gen rushed and flashlight blinded the whole time so I can see where these guys come from\n\nEdit: for people who haven\u2019t tried killer yet i recommend playing Myers first",
                "I used to be a genuine Killer Main(tm) back before we had the queue bonuses. Reason being that I am a solo Survivor and my teammates would regularly suck, and also because queues were always fast.\n\nNowadays I do as the Bloodpoints command. Though I do still lean toward Killer because queues are still usually faster and my teammates are (less than before but still) trash.",
                "Yes. I am bad at killer. Me suck. That\u2019s it.",
                "Yep, there are people who play just one side.\n\nI like playing the killer side almost exclusively since almost every killer has their own different strategies and playstyles, and some can even feel like I\u2019m playing a very different game. It doesn\u2019t quite feel the same way as survivor, at least to me.\n\nEvery person varies on their answers, but these players do exist within the DBD community.",
                "I play both, but like 30% killer and 70% survivor.",
                "I'm someone who plays both, but play more survivor, is a lot more fun for me, killer just puts me a bit tense, having to constantly calculate the chain can be a bit stressful, but also satisfactory in the case of a successful hit",
                "I mostly play survivor because I find the gameplay simple and easy. Just loop, do gens, and maybe escape. The most worst thing about playing survivor is bad teammates but I\u2019ve become accustomed to it. Meanwhile, I can\u2019t handle playing killer for more than 5 or so matches because it feels so stressful. Playing killer is a constant uphill battle of trying to get the upper hand over 4 other people with varying degrees of success depending on individual skill and luck. Some killers can do this easily, most struggle, and it\u2019s always stressful.",
                "I\u2019m a very jumpy person, I play killer only. Can\u2019t get scared if your doing the scary stuff.",
                "I have about 1.5k hrs in the game. For about 1k of those I played both pretty equally. A little over a year ago I fell off of DBD hard and now only play survivor with friends once or twice a week. \n\nI\u2019d like to play more killer but there are just other games that have captured my attention more lately. DBD went through a very rough patch with the releases of Knight and SM. I had absolutely zero interest in playing the game at all. It seems to be getting better now though. Maybe with the Xeno coming out I\u2019ll pick up killer again.",
                "I play mainly killer for 3 reasons:\n1: I personally find it more fun\n2: I didn't have friends who play DBD to play together as a survivor\n3: I'm bad at survivor and I don't want to go through the learning curve again",

                "I've always played the game sporadically and come back when new killers get added but follow the game changes while I don't play. When the game launched i rarely played survivor because at the time I didn't find it that fun at all.\n\nSince nemesis's release I've been playing survivor and it's been a breath of fresh air so I somewhat consistently play both sides but still favor playing killer.\n\nI've p3'd+ a majority of my killers but up until knights release the only survivor I prestiged was laurie and that was during when myers released.",
                "I play like 95% killer because I feel like I have ways to measure whether I\u2019m improving or not. I enjoy playing alone so I don\u2019t have to depend on other people for me to do my job. As survivor, it\u2019s impossible for me to tell whether my individual skill matters or not (and I know it\u2019s not great, so I tend to avoid it so I\u2019m not hindering my team). But there are way too many variables outside of my control as a survivor, and I get my enjoyment from the game by winning.",
                "i play used to play both a lot but mainly play survivor now because people that watch my content watch mainly survivor content. i will occasionally play killer though if survivor games aren\u2019t going that well.",
                "I exclusively play survivor because i like the characters on that side more. Also i don't know why but playing killer gives me anxiety like i feel there is too much pressure on me--survivor gives me the idea that i can \"spread the load\" and it feels more relaxing oddly enough lol",
                "I play Survivor 99% of the time now. When I first started for a year or 2 it was 50/50.\n\nMy favorite part of playing killer was being \"scary\" and specifically playing with a killer I think is fun. Michael Myers was and still is my favorite killer for so many reasons. I kind of like Pyramid Head, Clown and Dredge but that's about it. No other killers interest me.\n\nMost of the time when I played I found playing as killer to be \"easy\" up until SWFs came around... Then I realized I couldn't have fun anymore. Like the game was stupid easy unless they were perfectly coordinated. Most importantly, I learned that tunneling and camping were insanely strong and simply choosing not to do that and be \"fair\" meant you lose more. That basically killed it for me.\n\nEventually I realized playing solo/duo queue was WAY harder on a near constant basis and therefore more interesting. I got infinitely more enjoyment out of making the killer near miss or hit a vault or lose me or something. I eventually never felt anything like that playing as killer... it just felt like work.\n\nNow I play survivor almost exclusively. Solo/duo queue is tough but interesting.",
                "I play both sides, but when I first started playing, I was afraid to touch killer side. Luckily when I finally tried it I got a really nice group who encouraged me to keep trying instead of a bully group. Got my first 4k by the third game :D\n\nNow, Killer can be a bit daunting to get back to if I haven't played it in a while.",

                "I used to play killer very often but I stopped for a while which made me lose confidence if that makes sense? I feel a lot of pressure to perform well as a killer so I mostly play survivor now.

                "I only play killer, mostly because of the 5 survivor matches I\u2019ve played:\n\n1. I notice that the game is heavily team focused and can basically be impossible when you\u2019re alone.\n\n2. Playing killer is very exciting and I don\u2019t get the same excitement and intensity from survivor\n\n3. I don\u2019t find repairing generators fun\n\n4. Michael Myers",

Switching puts you back to square 1 and you have nothing but shitty base perks and can\u2019t do any funny builds.\n\nNot to mention unlocking characters with iri shards, or if you bought auric cells to get characters because it\u2019s cheaper.\n\nThe game is not good at pushing people to play both sides.",

Not as satisfying, not as much strategising either, especially when you\u2019re in solo queue. The list can probably go on forever.",
                "I've played since 2018 and have exclusively played survivor. I only play the game for the thrill of getting chased. Not much of a desire to do the chasing.",

I find survivor wayyyy more fun after fast vault buffs (idek why they did that) after bnp buff strong perks every patch only thing that erks me is the fact my survivor mmr is like 8x lower then my killer and it's so frustrating",

There's rarely any team cohesion at Silver (where I usually get stuck, and just go back to Killing).\n3. Silver-rank Survivors tend to hide and protect themselves at all costs, at the expense of the team. Then, they get hooked once and die, since everyone else is dead and they didn't take their turns on the hook. \ud83d\ude15\n4. *Dragon Ball: The Breakers* does Survivors better. Tools, utility, vehicles, saving civilians, fighting... in DBD, all you can do is gens or harass/annoy the Killer.\n\nI like being a Survivor (because you're still human), but I can't 360\u00b0 well enough to stay alive for long \ud83e\udee4 (skill issue) but it's not really worth my time to get better at it, when other games do Survivor better.",

I've only played Killer because my friends forced me to play it, then when they didn't have fun because I couldn't challenge them at all, they stopped.

I feel like going from survivor to killer is much easier than the other way around, and helps the health of the game. \n\nI understand how oppressive Blight can feel to play against and avoid the busted add-ons.

If I had to put that into perspective, I play maybe 30 killer games a year, either for rituals whenever I feel not lazy, or when I get the rare itch for a quick Killer game.

Incredibly undervalues survivor information perks like kindred or bond since he only plays SWF, and thinks just about everything that causes him to lose a health state, gen/healing progress, or an entire match should be nerfed.\n\nMost recently we had a game against bubba and he complained that killers should have to \"earn\" one shot downs through something like devour hope. He still plays like a bit of a noob sometimes because he only plays sporadically, so looping someone like bubba can be a bit of a challenge for him.",

I can make progress on-gens, stay stealthy, get people off hook, and heal. \n\nThere is no way to succeed as killer without mastering chase mechanics\u2026 you HAVE to get hooks/down survivors in order to slow their progress, and that\u2019s what I struggle with. There\u2019s no way around it. \n\nIt\u2019s definitely a skill issue lol, but I can admit that. I just play the role that allows me to have some fun and contribute.",

I play methodically which means my goal is to never even see the killer and get out. running around in circles getting chased doesn't do anything for me.\n\nWith enough time sunk into it I'm sure it would eventually become fun but it's simply not worth forcing myself to do something I don't enjoy hoping to one day enjoy it. \n\nAlso the game is fairly stacked against killers from everything I've seen. one of my first games on survivor was on rpd and I saw a generator once the entire match and still escaped without issue. I was lost as hell the entire time. \n\nOn survivor you have to outplay one person and on killer you have to outsmart four of them repeatedly.

I'm actually excited for the Texas chainsaw massacre game that's coming out soon because I can kill with friends!",

I could only really make out the killer heartbeat when he is on top of me, I can't hear footsteps or cries of pain at all. I can't hear Huntress or anyone else about to use a power. So on and so on.\n\nThis all makes it incredibly difficult if not basically impossible to play survivor because the devs will not add accessibility or sound subtitles. So I only play killer where it's still a disadvantage but it's better than not being able to do half my skill checks because they are always a complete surprise reflex test.\n\nThe visual heartbeat helps but not nearly enough with everything else still non existent",

I do it simply when I have challenges to or tomes I think wouldn't be hard to get. Back when it was a think, I reached Rank 1 in both roles solo, which was more of a time investment than a skill thing tbh. Still, I played survivor decently extensively before. I don't anymore.\n\nThere's reasons.\n\nSurvivor is \n1. Too team-based, which removes the control aspect of your gameplay and places it in the hands of randoms. \n2. Honestly kinda just boring. Doing gens is drab. Healing or saving teammates is just a time-waste simulator. So on. I like being more active and killer is where you get no \"down-time.\" \n3. The survivor aspect of chasing boils down to running well and reactions. The killer side involves more mind-games and mechanical skill (if you have a chase power) which is more attractive.\n4. The characters of the killers are just better. This is more of a petty gripe but playing survivor never changes better matches. When you play one, you play them all. Playing different killers invites different circumstances and more intensive play that's more nuanced and complex. I appreciate it feeling less repetitive.",

Killer definitely requires you paying attention to more things, you should never be doing nothing. Once you get more confident and comfortable though you can relax and still have a good game. I highly recommend trying both roles even if you don\u2019t want to play as them, you will get a better understanding of perks and their strengths and weaknesses.",

It's solo, easier, way more fun, and WAY more interesting. Every match is a tense and exciting as I make it. Killer decides exactly how the match will play out, often times even before the match starts: for example, if I queue as a Nurse or a Trapper.

                "I pretty much only play survivor unless my gf asks me to play killer cause she likes to watch. For someone with ADHD the reason I usually like playing survivor is because there's so many really oddly specific builds you can go for that require you to change the gameplay pattern up everytime though the core stays the same and there's downtime to relax and plan ahead. I have,\n\n-The annoy the killer and occasionally save someone but usually get myself killed build of Head On, Flashbang, Quick and Quiet, and Adrenaline/Blast Mine. \n\n-The I really just want searching for totems to feel relevant build/gens faster of Overzealous, Inner Healing, Built to Last, and Streetwise. \n\n- The Nic Cage/new meta special which I still die a lot using but have a lot of fun chases with of Dramaturgy, Plot Twist Made For This and Hope. \n\n-And many more related to making maps relevant, saving everyone from hook, trying to break all the totems, etc.\n\nFor me killer is fun but stressful. Part of my ADHD is object permanence isn't much of a thing I sometimes trick myself on accident and lose people easily. Also, killer feels like you never get a moment to pause and rest you have to keep going nonstop or lose. There's also the games where one survivor makes a mistake at a bad time and the game just feels over at times and it doesn't really feel good to just pubstomp either. It feels much hard to just relax as killer vs survivor. If I'm well rested I like killer more cause I'm amped up. \n\nWith killer too it really doesn't feel like you have as many silly builds it feels like it's aura reading, gen slow, anti healing, better chase. I would kill for a silly meme killer perk similar to blast mine like Compressed Air \"After being in chase with a survivor for 30 sec you can press the secondary action button to trap a generator in progress; the next time a survivor interacts it makes a loud noise and propels the survivor 10m away and shows their aura for 4 seconds.\" \n\nMy favorite killer games are when I play Nemesis or Trickster. With Nemmy I can usually get a 3-4k but I have to work my ass off for it. Like it always comes down to the wire. I never tunnel intentionally I just run around and respond to movement I'm like a dinosaur \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude2d and with trickster I loved trying to force people into open loops and then swearing at the entity when I get sent to RPD and don't have the bouncing blades \ud83d\ude2d",

When it came out in such a small box I was super confused, but it definitely changed my life! Our first games were Test Drive off-road and tomb raider 2. I remember in tomb raider none of us can figure out how to get out of the starting area where you slide down the gravel slope, and a tiger attacks you. We would literally just play that first area over and over again fighting the tiger and couldn\u2019t get out of it. Then one day I discovered how to do the backflip twist to grab a ledge to get out of that area and unlocked the entire rest of the game for the family.

We played several heated seasons. It was so intense. Some games you would play against at the CPU but most were head to head matchups. For head to head matches and the playoffs, half the dorm crammed into a dorm room to watch live. People were screaming and cheering. I remember I made the superbowl with the Titans year 1 and I threw a pick at the end of the game causing me to lose the game and it was soooo loud with all the outcry. People were also betting on the games. It was basically a sporting event. There was lots of trash talking too between the players. At this time, this was the only ps1 in the dorm.

Last season for me to watch all the league, cup matches, and Champions League, it would have cost me around 700\u20ac spread over a few difference streaming services due to the various rights held. Ridiculous. If Liverpool is on at a bar, I\u2019ll drop in for a few pints but other than that I just refuse to pay that kind of money.\n\nAs every season passes, it\u2019s like you\u2019re re-evaluating a long-term relationship that has been going on for so long and each time you try to bring up the pros of staying in and gutting it out.",

So $368 for the entire season to probably see 98% of the games.  I probably ended up   \npaying about $250 for the 2022/23 campaign.  Paid a few extra dollars for Champions League which is on Paramount Plus.  The beauty of that streaming service is that if you try and cancel they will give you a free month.  I think it is the one thing I watch that is cheaper in America compared to the UK.\n\nNOTE: Peacock sometimes runs a deal that is $24 for the entire year.  I did that for the previous season.",

                "With the state of the game, I feel like they are not even putting in effort anymore. Like, every expansion, they start to put in less and less content for the same price and keep saying that \"if we work on a new map or something we would  have to extract resources from something else like exotic mission or seasonal stuff etc\"\n\nI don't understand why? We are paying for seasonal content seperately, dungeon seperately, expansion seperately and don't even wanna talk about cosmetic shop sale. Why would they need to take resources from a area to make a new map or improve a particular game mode which community have been asking for years to improve now. Stasis is left in dust since the elemental well and shards nerf. They don't wanna do anything about it. Like maybe stasis is not selling anymore and no or less income source for them to actually invest in improving it. Maybe\n\nLiterally, maybe the final shape reveal changes my thought, but ye couple of years ago bungie Dev's vidoc, one of them said \"it's hard to make content in destiny and in general\" looks like they themselves are loosing passion for their own game, and I can see it now.",

I started playing D2 in November last year, and I'm enjoying the game because I haven't been stuck in some stupid sunk cost fallacy for this games entire life cycle. I get it, many of you remember better times, but holy hellfire it's sad none of you can find anything to like about the game and yet you're STILL HERE. You're like the boomer grandparents at a birthday party bitching about how it was so much better in your day.

                "I imagine that Valve have some obligation to be in control of payment channels they are in charge of for tax and legal reasons. Say if the Dutch government thinks there is some sort of illegal gambling type thing happening using Valve custom games then its Valve getting in trouble not the developers.",
                "Kinda inevitable, wonder if they'll make more official stuff for custom games like the Auto Chess Pass",
                "I have official monetization from Valve through a Custom Game Pass and they also sent me the same letter, demanding purchase data only they have since it\u2019s sold through Steam :) Quality work",
                "At least 12v12 will be somewhat playable now!",
                "Fun fact: This email also sent out to custom game owners who have [an official in-game pass granted by Valve](https://www.dota2.com/customgamepassfaq?l=english).",
                "This has to be what SUNSfan warned us about right?",
                "It honestly always shocked me that they allowed it in the first place. Seems like something that would just beg to have legal issues pop up.",
                "Seems valve wanna try unifying, if you wanna monetize custom game, you must using valve monetize system I guess.",
                "\"report to us the scope of your monetization\" is ominous. Is Valve going to try to bill these game creators and try to collect the money paid by custom game players to the custom game devs? Do the devs even have a responsibiltiy to comply in any way? I imagine some Chinese/Russian devs might not even cease monetizing and dare Valve to make another move.",
                "Ouch. I don\u2019t play regular dota anymore, but I do occasionally play dota 1x6. It has a paid subscription modelled after dota plus: hero progress, voicelines, etc. And the only actual gameplay feature it provides is that the subscribers can play the latest hero added to the mode (which is not all that significant, since a new hero is added every month or so). That monetization allowed the dev to work full time on the mode, so it sees regular large updates and is generally well-maintained. Would be a shame if it was abandoned",
                "... But Ability Arena. :(",
                "Seems like a W to me. Plenty of custom game modes have the same awful monetization you see in those cheap free to play Korean MMOs, and a lot of times the content you get isn't even made by them and just stuff from the Workshop and such. The fact it took them so long is what surprises me the most about that, because it's been an on-going thing for years.",
                "Ouch... while there definitely are a lot of cases where custom game devs are predatorialy monetizing, this kinda makes it impossible to develop a custom game and keep it working and up to date in a reasonable manner, because you need to be able to pay any devs you have if it's more than a one-man show. Best case scenario here is that Valve is sending these out to rope in all the devs monetizing their games and bring them under one roof where Valve can take their cut, but knowing Valve's track record with maintaining things, this might become worse before it gets better.",

The quality in comparison to WC3 mods is evident, back then it was about passion, now they're just Chinese inspired mobile games with microtransactions. \n\nAt this stage, if there's no budding developers that want to build out some quality games, just get rid of the Arcade.",

                "Don't abolish the monetization of custom games. The whole dota2 gaming community is against it because it will kill the whole genre. You could just remove the custom games section from the menu. I hope you understand that after monetization is removed, support from developers will stop, and therefore after a couple of updates something will break in dota, and there will be no one to fix it. At most in 6 months this whole genre will be dead.\r  \nAre you sure you are ready to go for it and lose so much online in dota2? After all, enough people continue to play dota2 only thanks to the presence of custom games.  \nThis is an appeal to Valve. Just hope they see it.",

It also hasn't had any meaningful content updates in like 2 years and they were just testing another custom that is essentially a reskin of DA.\n\nIronically DA was broken for 2 weeks(Skills didn't have proper descriptions) and this was the thing that forced them to fix it lol",

It is so tiring.  \nDota is not worth investing your time in it? Fine.  \nBut somehow, it's important enough to fuck people that put in the effort?\n\nWhat exactly is it? Do you give a rats ass about this game or not? Choose one or the other.",
                "Honestly I think it\u2019s a good thing. Most of these custom games have regular content that\u2019s gated for no reason. Other times it\u2019s straight up p2w and in some of these games, they don\u2019t show if people use p2w against you. Most of these custom games has awful balance and lack real effort, like original hero and original item designs. I haven\u2019t seen a single one who isn\u2019t half assed, where only few new items exist and all the std Dota items in shop are useless for the custom game\u2019s balance\u2026\n\nDo these game devs really expect to make a living off something that should\u2019ve been a labor of love / a hobby? Why? Stop being greedy, IIRC wc3ft wasn\u2019t filled with devs demanding payment.\n\nAlso by shutting down the games in a protest, you just make me angry at you, not Valve.",

                "This action will be the death of the arcade games. It is heartbreaking to see Valve taking disincentive decisions toward the Arcade section of Dota after building and improving it to date. No doubt that developers and communities will be negatively affected by this situation. We shall remember the famous saying that ''nothing is actually free''. If you are enjoying these contents created by third-party developers effort you should rise your voice so we don't lose it.",

Sunsfan depends on his custom arcade game as a source of income (not his primary source) and it's also a huge passion project of his, and he tends to talk about it almost always on his podcast (new updates, heroes, etc...). He loves the games he's created and making it with friends was something special for them.\n\nIf this is what Sunsfan was talking about, then it's difficult to process because Valve made no statement about what would happen next. Is there a monetization system Valve is including themselves for all arcade games? Do they plan to re-vamp arcade games? Bring out their own to play seasonally? There's a lot of questions and to leave it in the air like this is probably nightmareish for custom-arcade creators.",

God, that was such a fun time being around, playing with others, competing.\n\nLater, when I got the beta key, I made a slight transition to Valve's game of Dota 2.\n\nI currently have over 14 thousand hours, that tells you everything about how much I love, follow, watch and respect this game as a part of my life, with no regret.\n\nNow I'm a 33 years old man, I haven't played real dota in the last years that much, lack of time, energy and interest. I'm Investing my time elsewhere, but even now I still follow tournaments, buy battlepass's and play Overthrow with friends.\n\nI remember when Valve first introduced this mod to us, I tried it and I liked its concept. It's quick, fast phased, requiers you to think and act quick , it's possible to try all the heroes you haven't played and improve on them, go through new nerfs and buffs, try new items before a real dota game, and come out with more confidence to play that new hero.\n\nHowever, I felt bad when they stopped updating their best mod, which became so popular and played. And now, reading about the issues raised by Valve's legal team about the monetization of the Overtrow 3.0 mod, I can only say that I would feel deeply saddened if it ceased to exist, and that it is partly down to you, Valve, for putting out such a powerful mod that you have previously created.\n\nAnd it would be a shame if a way is not going to be found for Overtrow to remain so that both parties stay satisfied.\n\nFind a solution, please.\n\nOffer them alternative solution for montization: If your policy say that the mod cannot not be charged, (well surprise, surprise, it never was, so why now you come out with this sudden reaction?) you may be able to propose an alternative solution.\n\nFor example, let them ask you for permission to make your mod part of an official game add-on that they will distribute and benefit from.\n\nOr offer them a job, let them work for Valve or something, and work only just on this mod maintenance, couse, you were to lazy to do it yourself.",

If he's able to chain some supers the enemy is going to have a hell of a time getting on to the zone.\n\n3 Gems - Tick: Right lane. If Tick can position himself in the corner of the grass next to the walls he can act like a turret, just throwing mines into the middle and being annoying. And if any aggressive brawlers try to attack him he can spam his mines in the small passage and make it basically impossible to walk through.\n\n2 Gems - Surge: Mid too? Just so this comp doesn't get run down by tanks I went with a tank counter as a last pick. Overall just a great brawler and even if they have some long ranged he just has to upgrade to level 3 and he will be able to handle them too.\n\n\nVery fun and unique concept, please to another one in the near future!",

This little game does seem to have its own logic.  \n\nI'd add to that *one dog is the initiator* for each spin \"round.\"  The first one to initiate a spin has the pressure both to have psyched the other one out and to have gotten back around first.  Like you lost that round if you started spinning but when you turn around their face is already waiting. \n\nSO the goal for the non-initiator is to see what spin the adversary is about to do and mimic it much faster.  Not so much to score a point as much as to prove one is equal, fast, and tuned in.  \n\nTwo interesting moments:\n\nThis one feels like \"points\" are being scored.  0:11 sec mark the Brown dog looks away, and black scores (the logic of that moment feels right, but it doesn't make sense if you stop and think about it through human eyes).  They both know it and brown starts preparing a showcase of point-scoring talent.  From 0:15 on he scores a rapid 2.75 points.  \n\nBut if the rules are only about proving speed+physical superiority, the exchange at the 30 second mark is the most interesting.  Brown gets downright sweaty gamer to prove he's got the spin, counter spin, and stamina for a bonus spin.  While they can both tell the black dog is feeling worn down.",

Once one has \"broken\", then they leap about to release all the pent-up excitement then reset.\n\nObviously when I say \"assert dominance\" and \"aggressive\" I mean them in an entirely playful sense.

However, all of his names he chooses for his character\u2019s starts with \u2018woman-\u2018 with something like basher or annihilater attached to the end. I\u2019ve told him that is not okay, yet he just laughs and says it\u2019s funny? Even his little buddies he talks to says it\u2019s just a joke. Yesterday, I saw him playing world of Warcraft with the name womanchoker!! GROSS!!! This does NOT make me feel safe, rather feel very uncomfortable around him after finding this out.\n\nEdit: thanks for the helpful responses, I very much appreciate your help. It\u2019s reassuring to hear that this isn\u2019t common for most gamers on the internet!! \n\nIt\u2019s humiliating seeing him walk around and interact with others in these games with such disgusting names. It offends me and I\u2019m sure offends others too! He will go out of his way and use synonyms websites to think of more hateful words towards women. My mindset has quickly changed from thinking this is childish to just straight up scary.\n\nEDIT 2: Bernard went to bed early tonight, which was definitely unusual for him. Well guess what?! He just received a suspension on his blizzard account \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83d\ude02. Hard to feel bad for him, I\u2019d say it\u2019s rightfully deserved.

                "Somewhat related - in the 1970s a plane hit the stands in Baltimore during a playoff game. The only thing that saved the lives of fans was that the Steelers blew out the Colts so badly that the crowd in that section went home. \n\nJon Bois has a great video about it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alcVZZuj_WE",
                "My dad always tell me how his team, the Chicago cubs, also saved countless lives one year in the 1980's. They blew the series lead to the San Francisco Giants. This allowed the Giants to play the Oakland A's for the World Series. \n\nDuring one of the games in the series San Francisco/Oakland area got hit with one of their worst earthquakes ever. But only minimal deaths because no one was on the bridges when it hit. Everyone was inside watching the world series between the two teams in the city",

Literally every piece that had to fall in order to send the Colts fans packing before the final whistle blew did, and it saved countless lives.",

That\u2019s when we booked it to the concourse.",
                "Yup. Was there for it. We had no idea what was going on while inside the arena. We heard what sounded like a freight train going over the arena and the equipment over the court started swaying. Apparently things also started falling to the floor, like nuts and bolts, but I was under an awning so I didn\u2019t realize it. At one point there was a side panel that got blown out and you could see outside through it. There were never really any announcements other than the stay inside so we had no idea what was going on.\n\nI will say, a lot of people there were there to watch the Kentucky-Georgia game that would have followed that one, so not too many people might have left hopefully. Luckily we will never know because Riley hit an insane shot to tie it up. Definitely was an interesting experience as I was in senior year of high school. I remember my dad taking me and my friend(my dad had gotten tickets because my family is Kentucky fans and my friend is a die-hard Georgia fan) home after the all clear to leave was given. We drove by the Congress Center in downtown and you could see all the windows shattered and everything a huge mess as we drove home.",

George Hill\u2019s missed free throw near the end of regulation to J.R. Smith forgetting the score. Nobody called a timeout to save Smith. Right before all of that happened, with 30 seconds left and the Cavs up two, James thought he\u2019d drawn a charge on Kevin Durant, but officials changed the call to a blocking foul. Durant\u2019s two foul shots, and the rest of the craziness at the end of regulation, sent it to overtime. When it was over and the Cavs lost that game, James punched the wall in the visitor\u2019s locker room and broke a bone in his hand.\n\u201cThere were only two times he felt cheated after a game, Saturday (against Boston) and Game 1,\u201d another of his close friends said.\n\nhttps://theathletic.com/4159890/2023/02/07/lebron-james-nba-scoring-record-chase/\n\nThat is hilarious a January L being comparable to blowing it in the finals",

That's mainly because elden ring and bloodborne won the game year award. No much was knowing or liking the souls ( because they are too hard) , nor using their style. But after elden ring, you see the style spreading and being  used. It's a great example of the influence of \"the Game of the Year Award\" in both gamers who play directly the best games or the developers who get inspired by the winning games + The Award had a great effect on advertising to the souls as we can see here too.",

This looks like some shitty mobile ad for a game that doesnt exist. theres nothing of substance here, you could make this in Unreal in like a month. How are people praising this? The combat looks loose, characters are floaty as hell, and WAY too much slow-mo. The player model looks like those adult visual novel models that pop up on steam and each of the enemies are assets from the Unreal store.",

Avoid the wiki and most media for it, or else you can easily get spoiled on monsters/bosses. \n\nI have two pieces of advice for new players:\n\n1. There is no shame in leaving and letting your heroes live to fight another day. Recognize hopeless fights and leave before they get you killed. Sometimes it's better to cut your losses and lose one guy/his gear than to stay and get a party wipe.\n\n2. There are always fresh recruits on the stagecoach. If times get hard, just recruit 4 fresh heroes and use them for loot runs. Get as much as you can then fire them, so you don't have to pay for their trauma. \n\nAnd remember, overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer.",

No matter how many supplies you bring, suddenly getting your frontline killed in a freak turn of events at the start of an expedition is NOT a sign you should try and push through the rest of it with heroism and grit.

            "selftext": "Big list of my grips: \n\n- Affixes for NM dungeons are boring mechanics that don't add anything fun to the game. They are mostly just annoyning. \n\n- Why cant you just pick the nightmare dungeon level you want to try? \"No anon you have to gamble this currency to potentially get the level you want to push... isnt that fun anon?\" \"NO!\" \n\n- Itemization is unrewarding as you get no dopamine rush from anything that drops, mostly because all the unique drops are terrible. All the legendries are just rares with already attached powers. And you have to inspect every rare just to see if it has 3/4 things you want. \n\n- To many monsters explode on death. \n\n- To many monsters have annoying CC abilities. Looking at you fly monster thing, and snake thing. \n\n- Shrines and chest don't need to be cursed. In D3 when you find a shrine during a rift its an \"oh yes!\" moment. In D4 its - let me clear out all the enemies just in case its cursed then spend the majority of the duration wondering around an empty map trying to find a few monsters to kill. \n\n- Re-spec costs are just to damn high. \n\n- Re-Roll costs are just to damn high. \n\n- The best boss's in the game are during the campaign - you never see them again. \n\n- We were told there would be less back tracking in dungeons - that was a lie. All we do is go find item x put in way back on the pedestal you already found. Oh whats that you missed that tiny little side path? Oh thats where it was, run back and get it now.  Annoying.  \n\n- Higher level NM dungeons dont drop higher item power items. Makes no damn sense.\n\n- Every decent barbarian build has 3 shouts, and WW or Hota. and the other two slots dont really matter. \n\n- We had a \"HUGE BALANCING PATCH\", which turned out to be minor increases to basic skills.  \n\n- \"Uber-Uniques\" might as well not even exist. \n\n- Tree of whispers rewards suck ass\n\n- Unique's all suck. They dont have the right affixes to be useful. Nor do they have intersting powers to begin with. \n\n- Way to many \"if then\" statements on legendaries, \"Lucky hit: while berzering and you score a critical strike on an already bleeding enemy that is crowd controlled you receive a 5% discount on your next kfc purchase for 1.5 seconds\"\n\n- No you cant have a decent amount of stash space. Go make an alt and use it as mule.\n\n- What do you mean you want an in-game timer for World bosses and helltides? Just go to this website for that anon!\n\n- WHAT!? You want a way to sell and trade things in game!?!? No no no...just use this discord website. \n\n- A GROUP FINDER TOO!? Jeez you want everything now. \n\nEven the season 1 preview looks like its just annonying ass power creep bullshit with no real fun added to the game. \"What you dont want to re-grind 2 levels of renown just to be able to socket this whole new type of gem! ITS SUPER FUN BECAUE ITS A NEW TYPE OF GEM! HOW FUN IS THAT!\" \n\n\n\"Just shut up and consume season and get ready for next season\" - every apologist.\n\n\nEdit: Forgot - the other annoying thing....FUCKING SPAWNING 12 MILES AWAY FROM WHERE YOU DIED.",

It\u2019s the most beautiful game I\u2019ve ever played by a country mile. The controls are about as clunky as it gets. Climbing over ricks, losing balance (only sometimes?), flying off ladders and Skyrim horsing (yea, dunkey) up mountains.  The story is beautiful part of the time and painfully convoluted the other part. I know Kojima loves explaining how things work, but holy Christ, it\u2019s *so* much that I\u2019d have to jot it all down like a detective just to figure out what the fuck is actually going on. \n\nAll in all I fell in love and fell in aggravation. \n\nWhat do y\u2019all think?",

                "It's a good game.  Great graphics and a lot of character with the nemesis system.  Can find yourself getting a little too involved and taking things personally which is a good thing.  Not all games get you that invested.    One of the main genres I'd say does anything similar is souls/elden ring just because of the difficulty factor making you despise a boss in frustration lol.   Unfortunately, unlike the souls genre,  the mordor games protagonist imo is actually massively overpowered and can flip and do a ton of actions over and over which makes these games very arcade-y to me, like playing street fighter or something but against pawns.  The amount of flips and repeat actions you can do reminds me of bunny hopping in fps games that don't have stamina element.   While the mechanics of the combat are pretty solid physics wise they could be better designed power/chain attack/stamina wise.  Sometimes when playing I start feeling almost like it is one of those mass entity CGI generators.  I don't really feel a sense of danger much, there are too many powers at your disposal and you never really tire.  I can play on autopilot much of the time.  The game gets pretty repetitive after awhile.  I still love the games and the graphics (and HDR looks great).\n\nIt would be cool if a future game took the nemesis system but went way beyond floods of orcs.  However I expect that the nemesis system will end up having been more like a preview of what current and future AI models will be able to go farther with, making more realistic virtual personalities in games that are more engaging.",

Everything I share, I share with relevance to GameStop's marketplace.\n\nI wanted to clarify why this is impacting GameStop's marketplace (and why I thought it relevant enough to share here). This is \\*huge\\* for immutable's marketshare and ability to onboard more games. Between us, Immutable and Polygon have the vast majority of web3 games.\n\n***All of these games on Immutable's zkEVM are going to be listed and traded on GameStop's marketplace.*** I would never share anything irrelevant - this cements GameStop's marketplace as the home of Web3 gaming. Content is the most important thing to drive marketplace volume and this is going to drastically increase it.\n\nI generally try and be as open as possible with our product strategy and announcements, because our companies are close partners, and ultimately anything we do to accelerate web3 gaming affects GameStop marketplace. That being said - I take the feedback with love and will minimise sharing any \"pre-announcements\" in future.\n\nWith love and humility\n\nRobbie\n\n**P.S.** if you want to find out more about the details - and why this really, really matters - I highly recommend mine + Sandeep (Polygon co-founder's) Bankless interview: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xo5omSTWmOk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xo5omSTWmOk)",

                "Hey Robbie. I don't think anyone here is mad about Immutable taking more and more steps forward. You are a good guy and the vision you and your company have is more than honorable.\n\nThe problem is that we as GME investors have been deceived on a daily basis for over 2 years now. We are portrayed as scum who steal teachers' pensions, degenerate gamblers who buy meme stocks out of boredom and a generation that invests its money in companies that are doomed to fail. When in fact there was never a better researched stock in history than $GME. We know that we are robbed every day in full daylight.\n\nMany have invested a large portion of their wealth in GameStop because they have a vision of a better future and trust Ryan Cohen, his team and their partners. There are people here who sleep in their cars because they couldn't pay their rent anymore, but don't want to sell their GME shares because they believe in a better future and don't want to let injustice win anymore. \n\nMany of us have been waiting for years now for news that will bring our portfolio out of the deep red. Yes, it's about money too. Matt Furlong said in one of the recent earnings calls that GameStop is working on something that hasn't been done before in the retail sector. But we still don't know what that is, we can only guess.\n\nThat's why there's great hope in every announcement, that's why we look for hidden messages in tweets - partly for meme reasons too. There is a great hunger for justice. And that's why the disappointment is so great for many when a supposedly huge announcement is ultimately only a small step again. A small step towards a better future, but we are looking for a big step. The step that gives us what we think we deserve.",

The Polygon relationship is fantastic and Passport next month - hell yeah. \n\nWith so much of the past DD coming true right now, I think the apes are especially pumped for big announcements. That's probably adding to the mixed results from SuperStonk.\n\nStill bullish!",

                "First of all, thank you for coming here to hear the feedback. My 5 cents to the \"pre-announcements\" - if every little announcement is \"legendary\" or \"revolutionary\", none of them is.

                "Thanks Robbie. There seems to be quite a bit of space between what GameStop has going on and what IMX has going since the NFT marketplace is still in beta and not materializing revenue in a significant way. I think people feel this and lash out at positive IMX announcements because it feels IMX-centric. This is a really cool step towards getting to be the Web 3 hub for gaming though. It just hard for some people to envision given where we are now. Congrats, big step.",

                "Right on",
                ">\tContent is the most important thing to drive marketplace volume and this is going to drastically increase it.\n\nHard agree. Content, although not necessarily volume, imo, is just as important as the underlying system, if not moreso. Be it hardware or a service/system, in this case web3, if there's nothing to do, then are you really doing anything?\n\nLook at Netflix or even VR.  With Netflix, they used to have a lot of good quality content, even before they started creating doomed shows in house. Then all the companies they were getting licensing from decided they could make more money by cutting out the middle man and creating their own streaming service (with blackjack and hookers). Now they have less content, the content they do have is untrustworthy, even if it is good, and still trying to makeup that volume in the worst way possible. \n\nVR on the other hand also has a lot, for the niche it is, content, but the content is... Subpar at best. AAA devs are just rehashing pancake games with \"omph\" and indies are barely taking advantage of the VR virtual-scape. Essentially just making a pancake game but in 3d (I'm not discounting that there are actually good VR games made by both AAA and indie, but they are so far and few in between that I've packed up my setup last year and have yet to have the urge to set it up again except to play games I've already played. Even the sequel to my favorite VR game couldnt do that (but that's poor dev demographics than lack of ability or creativity)",

All it meant for me was having to purchase assets from a separate wallet on their separate marketplace because gamestop wallet doesn't support polygon. Different assets on separate chains is an consumer cluster fuck. It's difficult enough to try to get gamers onboarded to web3. Truly though the next time you hype an announcement of an announcement of an announcement\u2014 have it be something that matters to the user. \n\nIt's unrelated but the WAGMI countdown with the Bungie, DreamWorks and Apple logo was just a hiring.

Does this introduce any potential security issues for crypto/NFTs moving from one to the other?\n\n\\- How big a step is this towards full interoperability for the web3 space? (Specifically - between zkrollups and optimistic?)\n\n\\- In terms of foundational building, how \"done\" is the web3 network with the advent of zkEVMs? Are there any big issues remaining to tackle before it's ready for full-on public adoption?\n\nI'll admit I was disappointed not to see an existing IP titan for the partnership reveal, but definitely intrigued by the implications of the stream, and curious to see how the sub unpacks this once they start digging into them.",

I'm happy that you secured a dev, or whatever it was. It doesn't matter to me.\n\nThe only thing that this sub needs is evidence of partnerships or actions that are going to bring new revenue streams, items that change or reinforce the core business of GameStop, or other transformation news.\n\nAs of now, crypto has not brought any benefits to GameStop. Indeed, we have  poured some $100M into the NFT marketplace, which hasn't resulted in any earnings as yet. There is scant information as to if this was worth it or not.\n\nI ask you, what quantifiable benefits does this bring to GameStop? None. This is your company only. It does nothing for us. The only thing that we care about is if your partnership with GameStop has resulted in some proven, marketable product. Until then, web3 means nothing.\n\nIf you want to hype this community, then you need to put out something concrete beyond just \"crypto.\"\n\nEdit: downvote if you want. This isn't an anti-hype post.

You talk about zkEVM and all these different protocols, but these technical details are lost on most people, including me.

                "I'm coming from the crypto side, I think there may be a bit of confusion from some apes about what Immutable actually is, and the relationship between Immutable and Gamestop. They're close partners, but not partners at the same level of the stack. Immutable is essentially offering software-as-a-service, with Gamestop as one of it's customers. As for the hype around this announcement, from the crypto perspective, this is a huge - it's the web3 gaming equivalent of Microsoft partnering with Apple. The zkEVM you're hearing about is cutting edge crypto tech*; so the software-as-a-service Gamestop is using just got a hell of a lot better.  \n\n_______________________________________________________________  \n\n\n*I'm not an expert, but I'll try and give a quick explanation of what it is and why it's good.\n \n- Firstly, not all blockchains are equal. Bitcoin and Ethereum are the best because they are the most secure, you can trust your coins won't get stolen. This is mainly due to there being lots of people running the bitcoin/ethereum blockchains (so they are very decentralised), and the fact it would take a lot of money to \"attack\" them. (\"Attack\" here sort of means make a fake version that looks more real than the genuine chain to steal people's funds).\n- Immutable is built on Ethereum, which can be very expensive to run code on (this is actually kind of a good thing because of the \"needing lots of money to attack\" mentioned above). Obviously games built on Ethereum would suck if it cost $20 to send a game asset worth $0.50.\n- Immutable X solved this problem by using a rollup. A rollup sits on top of Ethereum (Ethereum being the layer 1 and the rollup being the layer 2). The rollup bunches a load of transaction together, and posts them as a single transaction to Ethereum. This makes doing something like selling a game asset WAY cheaper, like, less than a cent. But because it sits on top of Ethereum, you get all that great security from the Ethereum blockchain without paying the crazy prices to sell the game asset.\n- Up till now this rollup \"Immutable X\" has only offered a way to buy and sell NFTs (game assets), it's basically just an order book on the blockchain. What this new zkEVM tech (offered by Polygon) does, is turn that order book in to a **whole programmable computer**.\n- Immutable can offer this zkEVM platform to their customers like Gamestop, so Gamestop (if they choose) will go from having an NFT store front service (powered by Immutable X), to a whole fully programmable gaming blockchain service (powered by Immutable zkEVM).\n- peace out",

The future is \"omg here's a great game\" and it's on the blockchain.\n\nLong term investors are pumped. But we also can't wait for a AAA game. \ud83d\udc96",

And I think it needs an answer before the system goes mainstream .\n\nWhy should mainstream development studios participate in your store?\n\nIt's a great use case for you as a marketplace, it's great as a user, but as a game Corp, it's extra work to protect against things like clear or tiny skins.  And the end goal is to eliminate sales of your own skins.\n\nWhy would halo devs make an effort to allow a user to be a rubber ducky they found online if there isn't a payoff?\n\nIs there interest in the system from developers who have more to offer than being versed in crypto existing?\n\nI'm asking in good faith hoping you have a simple obvious answer.",

This has the same vibes, and I remember thinking that the internet idea sounded weird, and I never thought it would amount to much.  Thirty years later, and boy, was I wrong.\n\nI really do think that Web3 is to this generation, what the internet was to mine.\n\nI am really excited to be on the ground floor of this.  It\u2019s why I will hold a good portion of my GameStop shares forever.",

It's big stuff for sure, but a lot of people here don't even pay attention to what's happening in web3, i think partly bc they don't understand it and partly because they're still waiting for the easy announcement to come that'll excite them enough.\n\nBut honestly there's nothing happening that hasn't already been foretold by the community and GameStop's newsroom. I remember when we started talking about NFTs waaay before GameStop even hinted they were working on a marketplace. \n\nFor those of us who take the time to see the big picture, we see your work as invaluable to the future. The others, however, rely a lot on hype cuz they don't have such a firm foundation of DD knowledge.",

I currently own quite a few NFTs on polygon in my other-brand wallet and was hoping to be able to transfer them all to my Gamestop wallet eventually.

Unfortunately there are some bad actors in this community as well as those who are just plain tired after years of fighting goliath!\n\nKeep up the good fight, Robbie! and just one thing to add, would it hurt you to mention GameStop a few times during these releases? I've got a bunch of tokens tucked away, but GameStop is where a lot of your supporters are coming from and it would do well to start driving attention there now, rather than when the game goes live!",

I'll be honest, I don't know enough yet about web3, your company or this partnership to truly understand the weight of this announcement. What you explained makes perfect sense though, and I am personally excited about the future you're building without really understanding how it works.\n\nWe are dumb money. \nIf you or your team\u2014even with ape support\u2014could create or repost some breakdowns of Web3 / your work / context for announcements, with ELI5 or TDCR synopses, and include these on future posts DD-source-compilation style ( u / welp007 is fantastic at this), it could help it penetrate our renaissance-wall skulls. Videos are great, but most all of the time I'm interacting with the sub, silence is preferable. \n\nIt's really so freaking cool that you interact with us, and that I'm writing to you now. Like really. And what's even way cooler is what y'all are doing. And knowing how, and what and why, can help us be even more excited about really exciting announcements like this. \n\nThank you for having a dream to change the world and making it fucking happen. Keep up the good work mate.",
                "Don't minimize shit, and don't change, Robbie. This is a fkn EPIC partnership, but of course the combo of shillpocalypse and the extremely functioning-impaired regards are gonna take some time to understand the implications of your announcement. Thanks for all the sacrifices and for taking all the BS you've weathered and for the brilliant work you do! We veteran apes capable of seeing the big picture plan see your vast contribution and recognize the crucial puzzle piece that it is for GME! Godspeed!"
