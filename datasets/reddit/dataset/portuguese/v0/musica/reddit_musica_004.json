There is a life in the Orum where the spirits rest, and can even guide and influence their descendants.\u00a0\n\nIn Candombl\u00e9, we go through life and gather **Ax\u00e9, the vital force**, which is anywhere in nature. When we pass away, the body gives its energy to the new life, while the spirit passes its journey to make sure that they can give the Ax\u00e9 back to the earth.\n\nCandombl\u00e9 holy places are called **Terreiros**, which are formally known as Il\u00ea (House) Ax\u00e9 (Vital energy). The name of the terreiro pictured below is **Il\u00ea Ax\u00e9 Oya Ominid\u00ea**,\u00a0 where Opanije.com professor Junior Pai de Santo is \u2018Otum Alab\u00ea\u2019, a high-ranking Atabaque player for the Orixas.\n\nIn Brazil, differing from Africa, **many different entities are being worshipped in the same Terreiro**, whereas in Africa there is typically only one per region or city. Also differing from most regions in Africa where only men do divination and are high priests, in Candombl\u00e9 there are many great **Yalorix\u00e1s, female heads of Terreiros.**\n\nIn the centuries that followed the embarkment of the first Africans to the Americas, many different ethnic groups were put together in forced labor. They were systematically divided from those of the same language, to avoid communication in African languages, **forcing them to speak Portuguese**, to avoid their organization.\n\nThe **Bantu, Jeje, Fon, Yoruba, and Mal\u00ea** were the most common ethnic makeups of the enslaved Africans, most of which arrived in Salvador, then the capital of Brazil.\n\nThese African civilizations, represented by their enslaved people, were the base upon which Candombl\u00e9 religion drew its basis. The Africans, based on **oral traditions**, kept their knowledge through hidden rituals, chants, and rhythms, that were often of a **mixed ethnic base,** reflecting the multiple African cultures present in Colonial Brazil.\n\nIt is **impossible to date** when these hidden cults began to **take the forms presented in modern Candombl\u00e9,** but is possible to establish the first three centuries as the period where African culture changed and gave birth to Candombl\u00e9 as we know it.\n\nSyncretism and Candombl\u00e9:\n\nThe syncretic aspect of Candombl\u00e9, often misunderstood even in Brazil, is because the enslaved **Africans were forced to display Christian symbols to their captors**. This systematic oppression strongly influenced how the African cults displayed themselves, often masquerading the African Deities for catholic saints, to continue their cults however possible.\n\nEnslaved Africans were thought to be evangelized and Catholic, as it was very important to preserve the **appearance of Christianity** according to Portuguese oppression.\n\nThe Catholic method of **praying to saints was used as a way of masquerading the \u00d3rixas faith** within Portuguese oppression. As an example, Yemanj\u00e1, the Sea deity, and mother of most Orixas, was worshiped through Holy Mary figures, while the king of Ketu, \u00d3xossi was worshipped through Saint George. There were even figures covertly concealed inside the sculptures of Catholic saints. This was a way that Catholic saints were connected with\u00a0 Candombl\u00e9\u2019s Deities, to avoid persecution and keep the tradition. This is a culture that continued through Umbanda, another Brazilian Afro-Religion, and while individuals from Candombl\u00e9 still worship Catholic Saints, within most Traditional Candombl\u00e9 there is no more insertion of any Christian Saints.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe modern insertion of Catholic saints and Christian philosophies is **not part of Candombl\u00e9.** In Brazilian Afro-Religion, it is the Umbanda tradition that kept catholic saints and the figures of Jesus within their Cults.\n\nCandombl\u00e9 still traditionally preserves **respect for the Christian religion**, however, the last forms of catholic idols and representations in traditional candombl\u00e9 are fading, as one of the greatest Yal\u00f3rixas, the Priestess **M\u00e3e Stella de Ox\u00f3ssi** once said:\n\n\u201cPreviously when we initiated in Candombl\u00e9, and in certain periods of the year, it was **traditional to go to the church**. After I became responsible for this house, this has stopped, **because it is a custom that is not needed anymore**, we move on with the times\u201d\n\n[**Full article with visuals here**](https://opanije.com/what-is-candomble/)",

            "selftext": " \n\nI received a lot of love from the last resource I posted, so here goes another! Hope y'all like it :)\n\nSo what are Brazilian Rhythms?\u00a0\n\nThe rhythms that, even when **based or created** around rhythms present in other cultures, acquired enough distinctive elements to become **unique to Brazilian culture**.\u00a0\n\nL\u00e9lia Gonzales, a renowned Brazilian writer, and sociologist, defined Brazilian identity as **Latin-Amefrican**.\n\n**Brazil is a vast oral library of rhythms.** Brazil is not only the most biodiverse country in the world, but may as well be one of the most culturally diverse countries in the world. Rhythms are influenced by African, Indigenous and European influences, with the first two representing the core of most of the rhythms that were constituted in Brazil. **Brazilian rhythms are as plentiful as the trees and rivers flowing in its beautiful lands.** \n\nMany of the Brazilian rhythms that gained worldwide popularity and fame, were fostered on **terreiros.** Terreiros can mean the physical place where Candombl\u00e9 happens, the sacred places of Afro-Brazilian spirituality. They are key to understanding the **root of Afro-Brazilian Culture and African influence** in Brazilian culture.\n\n**The first rhythm** that comes to mind is **Samba**\u00a0and its numerous variations. **Samba is not, and never was a single and cohesive element**, and even the oldest references cite a handful of variations. But, the first variations were found in **communities that were based in Candombl\u00e9, especially in Bahia**, the oldest region in Brazil. These were the **Samba de Roda, and Samba Chula**, the original forms of Samba developed in the African mix present in Bahia.\n\n[You can check out our article on What Samba is, it\u2019s history and culture here](https://opanije.com/brazilian-rhythms/#what-is-samba)\n\nMuch of the rhythmic knowledge that gives **Brazilian music its edge** is found within **Candombl\u00e9\u2019s musicality**. However, there are other strong influences, such as traditional Indigenous music. which has also contributed to many rhythms and cultural roots, in a similar fashion as African music. These cultures are the key to understanding the **foundations of Brazilian music and rhythm**.\u00a0\n\n**Brazil and Africa share profound relations**, however, Brazil is formed by the **impact of several cultures.** Even when only speaking of the Afro-Brazilian ancestry, there are several Branches of African cults, religions, and rhythms. These branches represent several ethnic influences in Brazilian culture and can be understood as macro-cultural in essence.\n\n**Yoruba root Candombl\u00e9 (KETU Branch) Rhythms:**\n\n* Vasse\n* Dar\u00f3\n* Gink\u00e1\n* Ijex\u00e1\n* Aluj\u00e1\n* Agab\u00ed\n* Igbi\n* Avaninha\n* Ramunha\n* Aguer\u00e9\u00a0\n* Saval\u00fa\n* Il\u00fa\n* Sassanha\n* **OPANIJE**\n\n**The encounter of cultures was the source of Afro-Brazilian culture.**\n\n**More Candombl\u00e9 Rhythms found in Brazil\u2019s culture:**\n\n* Congo de Ouro\n* Congo\n* Barravento\n* Cabila\u00a0\n* Bravun\n* Adarrun\n* Pa\u00f3\n* Sat\u00f3\n* Bat\u00e1\n* Tambor de Criolo\n\nCultural crossroads\n\nAfrican cultural crossroads were the **foundations of Samba**, and all other Brazilian-made Rhythms. **Building upon the diversity of traditions present**, and the exchanging of pre-existing rhythms, Brazilian rhythm was born. Brazilian rhythms, especially in the early moments of colonization when Salvador was Capital, part of a common background, where they **co-existed with Candombl\u00e9,** the work chants and rhythms, and the play or entertainment.\n\n**Early Brazilian Rhythms:**\n\n* Samba de Roda (sometimes called Samba Rural)\n* Samba de Chula or Samba de Viola\n* Samba de Cabula\u00a0\n* Lundu\n* Early Maracatu (Now known as Rural Maracatu)\n* Maculel\u00ea and Capoeira Rhythms (S\u00e3o Bento Grande, Angola, I\u00fana, Cavalaria and many more)\n* Maxixe\n* Cateret\u00ea or Catira\n* Carimb\u00f3\n\nNative Indigenous, and the North \u2013 The Amazon Region\n\n**In northern Brazil, the indigenous population** is very expressive, and one of the basic rhythms created was the Carimb\u00f3. Carimb\u00f3 originated in the Par\u00e1 region, a mix between the Tupinamb\u00e1 indigenous people and Afro-Brazilian culture that arrived from north-eastern Brazil. **Carimb\u00f3 is the name of an Indigenous Drum,** which literally means **\u201chollow wood\u201d**. This tradition is one of the main rhythms in the North, all over the **Amazon region.** \n\n**Percussive Harmony** is the harmony made by the **different tones present in the drums.** They do not follow the western notation and are **tuned by ear** to match **traditional tones.** For example, in Candombl\u00e9, there are three Atabaque drums and an Agog\u00f4, and they constituted a pitch scale, from treble to bass: **Agog\u00f4** or **G\u00e2n** (highest pitch), **L\u00e9** Drum, **Pi** or **Rumpi** Drum, and **Rum** drum (lowest pitch).\u00a0\n\nThat\u2019s why it is **impossible to make a musical notation** for many Brazilian rhythms, as **the cadencies are impossible to express in the western form**: They must be felt through the body, almost imperceptibly changing each element, while **the whole becomes another unity.**\n\nWith the cultural exchanges with other countries growing, as artists traveled and brought back discs, **new African and Latin influences came to Brazilian musicians.** This inspired a change in traditional spheres, and now artists started to develop **more rhythmic variations** based on elements of other regions. **Merengue** is an example of a foreign rhythm that had **Afro-Brazilian percussive** elements introduced to it, and became a **leading rhythm in Carnaval,** especially for Groups like **Timbalada**.\n\nModern Brazilian rhythms:\u00a0\n\nBelow is a list of the most popular rhythms that evolved in different regions, each being influenced by a branch of the different roots present in Brazil, being influenced by African, Indigenous, Latin, and European cultures:\n\n**(Grouped by Similarity)**\n\n* Bossa Nova\n* Pagode\n* Partido Alto\n* Samba Enredo\n* Samba de Gafieira\u00a0\n* Samba de Terreiro\n* Samba de coco\n* Samba Duro\n* Samba Afro\n* Samba-Reggae\n* Ax\u00e9 music (Also understood as a collection of Afro-Brazilian rhythms used in Bahian Carnival)\n* Merengue (Brazilian Merengue)\n* Lambada\n* Forr\u00f3\n* Bai\u00e3o\n* Xote\u00a0\n* Xaxado\n* Brazilian Funk\n* Brega and posteriorly Brega-Funk\n\nFull Resource: [Brazilian Rhythms on Opanije.com](https://opanije.com/brazilian-rhythms/)\n\nTip for producers:\n\nSearch in YT for the name of the rhythms + as melhores (best in Portuguese) or rhythm + state where the rhythm originated (you can find out the name of the state by searching for the rhythm + estado de origem on google)",

I tried to make it in a way that might guide people into a deeper understanding of their rhythms.  Feel free to watch it.

                "Yet you missed so many!\n\nPlease don't understand it as a critique, but as complementary material.\n\nIt is fantastic that one can talk at length about Brazilian music and just scratch its surface. Carimb\u00f3, despite being a de-facto Northern rhythm (and not Northeastern), cannot eclipse Siri\u00e1, where its indigenous rainforest roots are even more present, being a midterm between carimb\u00f3 and the cumbia amaz\u00f4nica (with its great exponent Los Wembler's de Iquitos), and the real rainforest people rhythms compiled by Marlui Miranda.\n\nAbout Candombl\u00e9 rhythms, the ones played here are the African ones, so they're not Brazilian at all. What you can find as original are the \"ponto\" de Umbanda (aka Ponto de Macumba), but they aren't popular, as they're chanted during their religious ceremonies. Another somewhat popular one is the Caxambu, strongly tied to African religions.\n\nThe Northeastern region has great, profound and yet not noted/known Iberic and Sephardic influences, that make it inherit Jewish, Spanish, Portuguese and North African influences and musical dialects. The many styles that form the Forr\u00f3 (bai\u00e3o, xote, c\u00f4co, xaxado) and the modern bards, the repentists (repente, c\u00f4co de embolada, desafio), who mix music and poetry made on occasion and earn their livings as poet-buskers. The Armorial movement tries to compile and reinvent those rhythms and bring it to erudite salons, mixing it with orchestras, as seen in Ant\u00falio Madureira's Cavaleiro do Sol, many composition by Guerra Peixe, Ant\u00f4nio Madureira, Ant\u00f4nio N\u00f3brega and many others. Honourable mentions: Quinteto Armorial, Orquestra Armorial, S\u00e1 Grama, quarteto Roman\u00e7al. There's a profound fiddle tradition, where the rabequeiros (those who play rabeca, a rustic violin with the same tuning and structure but a very particular technique) take the place where the sanfoneiro usually is. And the flute tradition: banda caba\u00e7al, or banda de p\u00edfanos, with some exponents like Banda Caba\u00e7al Irm\u00e3os Aniceto (Crato, CE), Banda Caba\u00e7al S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 (Barbalha, CE), Banda de P\u00edfanos de Caruaru (PE) and many others.\n\nDespite the poetic license about the \"untranscribable\" character of the Brazilian rhythms, they are perfectly capable of being notated, and I've done it many times.\n\nAnd I didn't even scratch the surface!\n\nEDIT: Adding more to the theme, Brazilian Funk has its roots in Miami Bass and Afrika Bambaataa (Zulu Nation), and its influence is quite clear in both Charme and Funk, that are virtually identical in its origins despite different scenes. Later they diverged, but still preserve the TR808 drum machine."

            "selftext": "Disclaimer: I'm a Brazilian Musician and Percussionist, based in Brazil, who has lived in many states. This history is both bound by oral history, as well as scientific studies (there are sources in the original Guide, link below).\n\nFirst off: What is Samba?\n\n **Samba** is a general term for **various cultural manifestations** that take place in Brazil. It\u2019s a **fruit of the African Diaspora** and the interplay between different cultures within Brazil. It **originated in Bahia**, in the Reconcavo region, and became one of the most important symbols of Brazilian Culture. \n\nWhere did Samba Begin?\n\nSalvador was the **original Brazilian capital,** the first effort to organize the exploitation of the Colony. It became an important port for the **Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade**.\n\nOne of the most expressive examples of the African Exodus, Diaspora molded the city as is today. It\u2019s known to be the blackest city out of Africa, where African Culture and Religion are still worshiped, such as the cult of Orix\u00e1s, Voduns, and Nkissis.\n\n**Brazil alone** stood for **40% to 45%** of all Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade.Even after being the last country in the Americas to abolish slavery, illegal slavery and corruption rolled on for decades.From 1826 to 1850, 1.662 enslaved Africans disembarked in the United States.In Brazil, there were 1.099.018 disembarkments in the same period. [Source](https://www.slavevoyages.org/assessment/estimates)\n\nIt\u2019s evident why Brazil has the most African descendant population in the Americas, as well as to why it has the second largest Black population on the world, after Nigeria.\n\nSalvador and the outlying regions of the State of Bahia were the African melting pot of the 19th Century. African Cultures encountered in Diaspora, from the Muslim West-African people to Occidental Africans.These African brought their spirituality, and in Brazil, they made Candombl\u00e9. This new religion was based on old roots, the major being: Yoruba, Bantu, G\u00eage, and Fon people.A rich cultural mix was present, nurturing cultural expressions and rhythms present in Brazil, such as capoeira and Samba de Roda. \n\n**Samba de Roda is the first form of Samba** \n\n **Samba de Roda,** which could be freely translated as **Samba of Circle** (of People) is recognized as the first form of Samba. Its origins are in the middle 1800s in the region of \u2018Rec\u00f4ncavo\u2019. It is home to the Historical cities founded within close reach of Salvador.\n\n\u2018**Rec\u00f4ncavo**\u2018 was all coastal and interior regions of the \u2018**Bahia de Todos os Santos\u2019**, which can be translated as **All Saints Bay.**\n\n### Bahia de Todos os Santos \u2013 All Saints bay\n\nWhen asking what is Samba, it is important to understand that there were many other traditional cultural expressions on its side. It was part of a group that also contained Barravento, Capoeira, Congo de Ouro, all united within the Afro-Brazilian Communities.The rhythms were also permeated by the symbols, chants, and culture that originated in Candombl\u00e9 houses, the **\u2018Terreiros\u2019**. \n\n Samba de Roda is ever-present in **Candombl\u00e9** and other Afro-Brazilian religions. The rhythm is especially played to the spiritual entities from Brazilian ground. The **\u2018Caboclos\u2019, \u2018Marujos\u2019 and \u2018Boiaderos\u2019** are examples of spiritual entities understood to be native of Brazil. They are believed to be of mixed indigenous and African ethnicity. They embody what is the **native Brazilian spirits**, called \u2018**Encantados**\u2019 which translates to \u2018enchanted\u2019. \n\nFor the rest of the history, you can look at the guide on [Brazilian Samba Guide](https://opanije.com/what-is-samba/)!",

Thanks for spreading the knowledge out there! \n\nI know no one asked, but i would like to make some suggestion to add \ud83d\ude01\n\nU could add to the example of the different forms that the samba took between the regions, like the \"Samba chula\" from Santo Amaro, Bahia, that it could be seen as a variation of samba de roda that u cited. And also the \"Coco\", that had its roots more to the north and is a traditional rythim from pernambuco. \n\nAnd also to the samba de malandro u could add the \"Samba de Breque\",  (  Moreira da Silva, Bezerra) \n\nReally good guide to samba!
