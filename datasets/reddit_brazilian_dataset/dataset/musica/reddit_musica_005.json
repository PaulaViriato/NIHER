His melancholic and lonely, sort of \"absurdist\" style is distinctly similar to Nick's. I wonder if Tim was actually influenced by him\u2013or whether he's heard of him at all, for that matter. One could argue this style is quite ubiquitous in music\u2013especially in Brazilian music such as Bossa Nova and in the early stages of Samba. Let me know what you guys think (I might be completely trippin).",

So that other influences are almost neglibible. This brand of music just feels so genuinely and historically Brazilian to me."

                "This song do some smart play with words, adding to the other comment, he says in the first word \"analfomegabetismo\" is composed by multiple words:\nAnalfabetismo is illiteracy, refers to the ignorance the other comment said\nAlfa and omega that are a way to describe god \nMega thatvis big\nThe second part \"somatopsicopneumatico\" comes from psychology\nSoma is the body\nPsico mind\nPneumo air\nSo basically they don't know about god their mind and the air they live from\n\nThere's a possible other interpretation that i invented but probably wasnt what he meant:\nSomato can be understood as \"s\u00f3 matou\" that means \"only killed\" and the words psico and pneumatico are common in diseases, so it would be saying that illiteracy (ignorance) doesn\"t kill, in an ironic way criticising the education on brazil at the time\n\nThat is probqbly me being crazy but it would be a genious move from caetano to put more meaning in the two invented words\n\nAlso he articulates very badly while singing reference to the illiteracy",

                "Odair Jos\u00e9 is a popular-romantic singer and composer that made big success with the lower-class Brazilian listeners. His lyrics have ingenuous simplicity and directness but often featured controversial subjects like housemaids, contraceptives, prostitutes and even a porn magazine. He was nicknamed by the press as \"Terror das empregadas\" (Housemaids' terror) and \"Bob Dylan da Central\" (Central do Brasil's Bob Dylan). He got a lot of trouble with Brazilian censorship over the subject of his lyrics.\n\nBut he was somewhat musically ambitious. After leaving Brazilian branch of CBS in disagreement with their factory-like artistic control he arrived at Polygram in 1972 and went for a more modern sound. There he met musicians Hyldon and future members of band Azymuth. Later even tried a rock-opera album.\n\n[His 1973 record](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_n2-Zvx1ZEKPjP8CEHgGSCSHSCyyJpdQJc) has his biggest hits and sounds amazing to this day by avoiding the overuse of organ and strings. He never reached the prestige of other MPB greats (composed mostly of middle-class origin) and his career stalled after the 80s but never forgotten.\n\nThe track featured is really ripped from Neil Diamond's 1972 track [Morningside.](https://youtu.be/TR77qT33Etc?t=56)",

The songs chosen included compositions from other writers and collaborators. More importantly, the songs chosen were better fits for Cartola's voice and delivery. In addition, Dino \"7\" Cordas had more time to work on the arrangements, he had more time and space for solos and instrumentation. The arrangements are deeper, and this is apparent on nearly every track on the album. \n\nThe second album is ranked higher than the first, or the later albums, when counting down the best Brazilian albums of all time.",

Augusta spends his money buying clothes and perfumes, as there are boutiques in the area. Ang\u00e9lica famous for bakeries, 'gave him cake' (an expression that roughly means missing appointments) and smells like doctor's office (also because of the many doctor's clinics in the area). After those disappointments he finds consolation with Consola\u00e7\u00e3o (word play).\n\nOther places mentioned are Largo dos Aflitos in Salvador, Bahia and [Esta\u00e7\u00e3o da Luz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luz_Station) in S\u00e3o Paulo."
